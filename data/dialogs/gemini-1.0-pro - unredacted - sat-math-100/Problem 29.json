The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\nQuestion: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?\nChoices:\n  A: Venus\n  B: Saturn\n  C: Uranus\n  D: Neptune\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the planet with the acceleration due to gravity that would result in the desired weight. \nMy error was in misinterpreting the formula and failing to account for the mass of the object.\nError Keywords:\n - Formula misinterpretation\n - Mass omission\n - Gravity acceleration confusion\nSolution:\nThe weight of an object on Earth is 150 newtons.\nThe weight of an object on another planet is 170 newtons.\nThe acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\nThe acceleration due to gravity on the other planet is unknown.\nThe formula for weight is $W=m g$.\nWe can use the formula to find the acceleration due to gravity on the other planet.\n$W=m g$\n$170=m \\times 9.8$\n$m=\\frac{170}{9.8}$\nWe can use the chart to find the planet with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\nThe planet with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$ is Saturn.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the weight of the object on Earth.\n2. Identify the desired weight of the object on another planet.\n3. Identify the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.\n4. Use the formula $W=mg$ to find the mass of the object.\n5. Use the chart to find the planet with the acceleration due to gravity that would result in the desired weight for the given mass.\n6. Be mindful of the units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the known and unknown variables.\n - Always use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.\n - Always be mindful of the units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the weight of an object is directly proportional to its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.\n"
