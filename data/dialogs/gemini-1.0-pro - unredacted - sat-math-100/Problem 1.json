Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $v=h+k-16 t$\n  B: $v=\\frac{h-k+16}{t}$\n  C: $v=\\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$\n  D: $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Explanation:\nMy initial approach was correct in isolating $v$ on one side of the equation. However, I made a sign error when factoring out $v$. I should have factored out a negative $v$ from both terms on the right side of the equation, resulting in a positive $16t$ term instead of a negative one.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Sign error\n* Factoring error\n* Algebra error\n## Solution:\n1. Move the constant term to the left side:\n$$h+k=-16 t^{2}+v t$$\n2. Factor out $v$:\n$$h+k=v(t -16 t)$$\n3. Isolate $v$:\n$$v=\\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$$\n## Instructions:\n1. Identify the term containing $v$.\n2. Isolate the term containing $v$ on one side of the equation.\n3. Factor out $v$ from the remaining terms.\n4. Be mindful of signs when factoring.\n5. Simplify the expression for $v$.\n## General Advice:\n* Double-check all calculations and signs to avoid careless errors.\n* Break down complex equations into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* Practice factoring and manipulating algebraic expressions.\n* Review the order of operations (PEMDAS) to ensure correct calculations.\n* When unsure, double-check your work or consult additional resources.\n"
