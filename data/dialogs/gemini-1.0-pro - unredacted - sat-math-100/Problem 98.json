However, I made an error in the calculation of $x$ after substituting the value of $y$. Instead of $-31$, I incorrectly calculated $x$ as $-19$. This resulted in selecting the wrong answer choice.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Calculation error\n* Substitution error\n* Sign error\n**Solution:**\nFollowing the correct steps of substitution:\n1. From the second equation, $x = 2y - 19$.\n2. Substitute this expression for $x$ in the first equation: $3(2y - 19) + 4y = -23$.\n3. Simplify and solve for $y$: $6y - 57 + 4y = -23$, $10y = 34$, $y = \\dfrac{34}{10}$, $y = \\dfrac{17}{5}$.\n4. Substitute the value of $y$ back into the second equation to solve for $x$: $2(\\dfrac{17}{5}) - x = -19$, $\\dfrac{34}{5} - x = -19$, $x = \\dfrac{34}{5} + 19$, $x = \\dfrac{133}{5}$.\n5. Therefore, the correct solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (\\dfrac{133}{5}, \\dfrac{17}{5})$.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. Carefully perform calculations, paying close attention to signs and operations.\n2. Double-check calculations before moving to the next step.\n3. Use a calculator for complex calculations to minimize manual errors.\n4. Review the solution process to identify any potential mistakes.\n**General Advice:**\n* Understand the underlying concepts of the problem before attempting to solve it.\n* Choose an appropriate method for solving the problem based on its type.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Be meticulous and organized in your calculations and reasoning.\n* Always double-check your work before finalizing your answer.\n"
