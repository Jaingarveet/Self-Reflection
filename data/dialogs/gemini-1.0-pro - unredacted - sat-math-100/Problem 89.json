The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?\nChoices:\n  A: 250\n  B: 350\n  C: 450\n  D: 1,350\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in calculating the total area covered by 48 ounces of graphene. I correctly calculated the number of football fields that 48 ounces of graphene could cover, but I then incorrectly multiplied that number by the area of a single football field. I should have multiplied by the area of 48 football fields.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Multiplication error\n- Unit conversion error\nSolution:\nOne ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.\n48 ounces of graphene can cover 48 * 7 = 336 football fields.\nEach football field has an area of 1 1/3 acres.\n336 football fields have an area of 336 * 1 1/3 = 448 acres.\n48 ounces of graphene can cover 448 acres.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key information.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n3. Perform the calculations step-by-step, ensuring that the units are consistent throughout.\n4. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before arriving at a final answer.\n5. Consider alternative approaches or estimations to verify your answer.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to units and ensure they are consistent throughout the calculations.\n- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n- Double-check your calculations and reasoning before arriving at a final answer.\n- Consider alternative approaches or estimations to verify your answer.\n- Be mindful of common errors such as calculation mistakes, unit conversion errors, and misinterpretations of the problem.\n"
