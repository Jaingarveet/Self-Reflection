Which of the following defines $f$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $f(n)=n-3$\n  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$\n  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$\n  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the slope of the function. \nI correctly identified the y-intercept, but I made a mistake in calculating the slope.\nError Keywords:\n - Slope calculation error\n - Linear function analysis error\nSolution:\nThe table shows that the function increases by 3 each time $n$ increases by 1.\nThis means the slope of the function is 3.\nThe table also shows that when $n=1$, $f(n)=-2$.\nThis means the y-intercept of the function is $-2$.\nTherefore, the equation of the function is $f(n)=3n-2$.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the change in $f(n)$ for each increase of 1 in $n$.\n2. Calculate the slope of the function by dividing the change in $f(n)$ by the change in $n$.\n3. Identify the value of $f(n)$ when $n$ is equal to the first value in the table.\n4. Calculate the y-intercept of the function by subtracting the product of the slope and the first value of $n$ from the first value of $f(n)$.\n5. Write the equation of the function in slope-intercept form: $f(n)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nAdvice:\n - When analyzing linear functions, pay close attention to the change in the output value for each change in the input value.\n - Remember that the slope of a linear function represents the rate of change of the function.\n - Remember that the y-intercept of a linear function represents the value of the function when the input value is zero.\n - Always double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting your final answer.\n"
