However, I made a mistake while combining the $x^2y$ terms. I incorrectly added them instead of subtracting them, leading to an inaccurate final answer.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Sign error\n* Combining like terms error\n* Addition/subtraction error\n## Solution:\n1. Distribute the negative sign:\n$$(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}) - (-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}) =$$\n$$x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2} + x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$\n2. Combine like terms:\n* Combine $x^2y$ terms: $x^2 y + x^2 y = 2x^2 y$\n* Combine $xy^2$ terms: $5xy^2 - 3xy^2 = 2xy^2$\n* Combine $y^2$ terms: $-3y^2 + 3y^2 = 0$\n3. Final expression:\n$$2x^2 y + 2xy^2$$\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully distribute any negative signs.\n2. Identify like terms (terms with the same variables and exponents).\n3. Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients, depending on their signs.\n4. Double-check your calculations and ensure all like terms are combined.\n5. Write the final simplified expression.\n## General Advice:\n* Pay close attention to signs when distributing or combining terms.\n* Double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n* Organize your work to keep track of like terms and their coefficients.\n* If unsure, break down the problem into smaller steps and tackle them one at a time.\n* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and avoid repeating mistakes.\n"
