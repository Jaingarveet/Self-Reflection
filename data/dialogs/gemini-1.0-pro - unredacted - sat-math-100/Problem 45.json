There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?\nChoices:\n  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$\n  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$\n  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$\n  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial analysis correctly identified the slope and y-intercept of the linear relationship. However, I made a crucial error in interpreting the context of the problem. I focused solely on the change in shipping charge per 5-pound increase, neglecting the initial charge of $16.94 for 0 pounds of merchandise. This led me to overlook the constant term in the linear equation.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Contextual misinterpretation\n* Incomplete analysis\n* Ignoring initial value\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the slope:** The shipping charge increases by $4.95 for every 5-pound increase, resulting in a slope of $4.95/5 = 0.99$.\n2. **Consider the initial value:** When the merchandise weight is 0 pounds, the shipping charge is $16.94. This represents the y-intercept of the linear relationship.\n3. **Formulate the equation:** Using the slope and y-intercept, the linear equation representing the total shipping charge $f(x)$ for a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is:\n$$f(x) = 0.99x + 16.94$$\n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1. **Read the problem carefully:** Pay close attention to all details and context provided.\n2. **Identify key information:** Extract relevant data points and relationships from the problem.\n3. **Analyze the context:** Consider all aspects of the problem, including initial values and boundary conditions.\n4. **Formulate the solution:** Develop a step-by-step approach based on the identified information and context.\n5. **Double-check your work:** Verify your calculations and interpretations to ensure accuracy.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* **Visualize the problem:** Create graphs, diagrams, or tables to represent the information.\n* **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Check for common errors:** Be aware of potential pitfalls like misinterpretations and calculation mistakes.\n* **Seek clarification:** If unsure about any aspect of the problem, seek clarification or additional information.\n* **Practice and learn from mistakes:** Analyze your errors and actively seek ways to improve your problem-solving skills.\n"
