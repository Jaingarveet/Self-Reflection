        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted \"as it is\" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible \"reality\" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: \"The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.\" The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art \"a shameful destiny.\" A literary work must stand or fall on its \"artistic merit,\" he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is \"artistic\" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: \"To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.\" The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be \"useful\" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.\nQuestion: In the context of the passage, the description of a work of literature as \"useful\" mainly refers to its\nChoices:\n  A: proficiency at depicting the realm of the fantastic\n  B: effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas\n  C: ability to help bring about social change\n  D: facility for exploding the boundaries of the tangible world\n  E: capacity to advance a particular theory of literature\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the context.\n - Always identify the different perspectives presented in the passage.\n - Always focus on the specific question being asked.\n - Never let your personal bias or interpretation affect your answer.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the context of the passage.\n"

        "content": "Thought:\nThe passage discusses different views on the purpose of literature during Dostoyevsky's time. The radical critics believed that literature should be useful by contributing to the creation of a new society and exposing injustices. However, Dostoyevsky had a different perspective. He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that artistry is the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts.\n\nThe question asks for the description of a work of literature as \"useful\" mainly refers to in the context of the passage.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic is intimately bound up with the real, he did not believe that proficiency at depicting the realm of the fantastic is the main description of a useful work of literature.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because while the radical critics believed that literature should help bring about social change, Dostoyevsky did not believe that this is the main description of a useful work of literature.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, he did not believe that this is the main description of a useful work of literature.\n\nChoice E is incorrect because Dostoyevsky did not believe that a work of literature should advance a particular theory of literature.\n\nChoice B is the correct answer because Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts. Therefore, effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas is the main description of a useful work of literature according to Dostoyevsky.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
