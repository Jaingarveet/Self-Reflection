The speed of onset, duration of action, and reversibility of these drugs vary. The choice of muscle relaxant depends on factors such as the type of surgery, the patient's medical history, and the anesthesia plan.\n\nThe shoest acting skeletal muscle relaxant is suxamethonium. It works within 30 seconds to 1 minute and has a short duration of action, typically lasting 10 to 15 minutes. It is often used for short surgical procedures and in emergency situations where rapid paralysis is necessary.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
