The transplanted cells can produce insulin, regulating the recipient's blood sugar levels. The transplantation site should provide adequate blood supply and minimize the risk of immune rejection.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\nThe correct answer is \"C: Liver\". Islet cells are typically transplanted into the liver, which provides a suitable environment for their survival and function. The liver's blood supply and proximity to the pancreas, where the islet cells originate, make it an ideal site for islet cell transplantation."
