Imaging investigations are essential in diagnosing pyloric stenosis.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nRationale:\nComputed Tomography (CT) is the imaging investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis. CT scans can accurately diagnose pyloric stenosis by providing images of the pylorus and the surrounding tissues, allowing the visualization of any abnormalities or obstructions. Ultrasonography (USG) and Upper GI series (UGI) can also be used, but CT is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing pyloric stenosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is not typically used in the initial evaluation of pyloric stenosis."
