Some people claim that it is the seal that caused the reduction of crocodiles. However, seals rarely feed on crocodiles, making it difficult to establish this argument.\n\nReflection:\nTo weaken the argument, we need to find evidence that contradicts the claim that seals are responsible for the decline in crocodiles.\n\nOption A: Seawater pollution causes more damage to crocodiles than seals.\nThis option suggests that another factor, such as pollution, could be responsible for the decline in crocodiles, making it less likely that the seals are the cause. [REDACTED]\n\nOption B: Despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles.\nThis option highlights the fact that there are still more crocodiles than seals in the North Atlantic Ocean, which contradicts the argument that seals are responsible for the decline in crocodiles. [REDACTED]\n\nOption C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of crocodiles in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased.\nThis option suggests that the decline in crocodiles occurred before the increase in seals, which would make it less likely that the seals are responsible for the decline. [REDACTED]\n\nOption D: Crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals.\nThis option highlights the fact that seals and crocodiles have different diets, which makes it unlikely that the seals are responsible for the decline in crocodiles.
