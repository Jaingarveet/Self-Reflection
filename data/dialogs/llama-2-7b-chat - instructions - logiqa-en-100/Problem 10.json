The correct answer is B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations.\n\nReflection: I misinterpreted the information provided in the passage. I thought that the effect of the micro-shocks on the brain's computing power was permanent, but the passage states that the effect can last at least half a year. This suggests that the micro-shocks do not have a permanent effect on the brain's computing power.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
