At least one person of Bingding is selected: This means that Bingding is a must-have candidate in the selection process.\n2. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected: This means that if E is chosen as the fourth candidate, then A and B will also be selected.\n3. A maximum of 2 people are selected: This means that only two candidates can be selected from the remaining options.\n\nNow, let's apply these constraints to the given options:\n\nA: A is not selected, as the constraint \"At least one person of Bingding is selected\" takes precedence.\nB: B is selected, as the constraint \"If E is selected, then A and B are also selected\" is satisfied.\nC: C is not selected, as the constraint \"A maximum of 2 people are selected\" is violated if C is chosen.\nD: D is not selected, as the constraint \"At least one person of Bingding is selected\" is not satisfied.\n\nAction: Therefore, the correct answer is (B) B."
