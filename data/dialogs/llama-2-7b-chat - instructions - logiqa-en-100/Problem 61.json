To determine the correct answer, I will use the information provided in the problem.\n\nAction: I will use the given information to determine the possible combinations of departments that F and M could be in charge of.\n\nReflection:\n\n1. F and M are not in charge of the same department, so they must be in charge of different departments.\n2. There are three departments, so there are a total of 3 x 2 = 6 possible combinations of departments.\n3. F and G are not in charge of the same department, so F and G cannot be in charge of the same department.\n4. H and I are not in charge of the same department, so H and I cannot be in charge of the same department.\n\nUsing the above information, we can determine the possible combinations of departments that F and M could be in charge of:\n\n1. F and M are in charge of Department 1 and Department 2, respectively.\n2. F and M are in charge of Department 1 and Department 3, respectively.\n3. F and M are in charge of Department 2 and Department 3, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these combinations is true based on the given conditions:\n\n1. There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time, so F and M cannot be in charge of three departments simultaneously.\n2. F and G are not in charge of the same department, so F and G cannot be in charge of Department 1 and Department 2, respectively.\n3. H and I are not in charge of the same department, so H and I cannot be in charge of Department 1 and Department 3, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) F and M are in charge of Department 1 and Department 2, respectively."
