For instance, if the industry as a whole is experiencing growth, it is good for all enterprises within it. On the other hand, if the industry is facing challenges such as over-capacity or declining demand, it is bad for all enterprises.\n\nIn this new perspective, the statement that gives the most reasonable explanation for the change in the problem is (D) What used to be good or bad in the industry is now only good or bad for enterprises. This statement acknowledges that the industry-level factors now play a more significant role in determining the success of individual enterprises.\n\nTherefore, I answer the question (D) What used to be good or bad in the industry is now only good or bad for enterprises.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
