Unless F participates, M does not participate.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of players that meet these conditions:\n\nA) F and G: This combination does not meet condition 1, as both F and G will participate.\nB) E and M: This combination does not meet condition 2, as neither J nor K will participate.\nC) F and K: This combination meets conditions 1 and 2, but violates condition 3, as G does not participate if J participates.\nD) G and K: This combination meets conditions 1, 2, and 3, but F does not participate.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of these combinations:\n\nA) F and G: This combination does not meet condition 1, so it is not a valid choice.\nB) E and M: This combination does not meet condition 2, so it is not a valid choice.\nC) F and K: This combination meets conditions 1 and 2, but violates condition 3, so it is not a valid choice.\nD) G and K: This combination meets conditions 1, 2, and 3, so it is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
