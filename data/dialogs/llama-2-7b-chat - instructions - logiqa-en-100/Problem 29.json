However, this is not a valid assumption, as there are many people who can provide objective and unbiased judgments, regardless of their opinions on the matter.\nThe correct answer is (B) The above argument has a logical error of \"confused concept\". The argument is confusing the concept of opinion with the concept of judgment. Opinions are personal beliefs or views, while judgments are objective assessments based on evidence and reasoning. The argument is flawed because it assumes that opinions and judgments are the same thing, when in fact they are not.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) The above argument has a logical error of \"confused concept\"."
