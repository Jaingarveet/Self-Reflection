The passage states that \"polluting industries are transferred from developed countries to developing countries,\" indicating that both types of countries have polluting enterprises. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nSelf-reflection: I made a mistake in my initial answer, but I was able to identify the error and correct it through careful reading and reflection. I will continue to approach this question with a critical and thoughtful mindset.\n\nAnswer: Option B: Both developed and developing countries have polluting enterprises."
