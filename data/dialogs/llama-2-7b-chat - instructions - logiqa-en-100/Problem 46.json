However, upon further reflection, I realized that pair (B: G and X) is the unlikely pair to be assigned to the sales department.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. Condition (1): H and Y must be allocated in the same department. Since Y is already allocated to the sales department, H cannot be allocated in the same department as Y. Therefore, pair (C: G and Y) is not a viable option.\n2. Condition (2): F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. Since G is already allocated to the production department, F cannot be allocated in the same department as G. Therefore, pair (A: G and I) is not a viable option.\n3. Condition (3): If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. Since X is already allocated to the sales department, W must be allocated in the production department. Therefore, pair (D: H and W) is not a viable option.\n4. Condition (4): F must be allocated in the production department. Since F is not allocated to the production department, it cannot be allocated in the same department as G. Therefore, pair (B: G and X) is the unlikely pair to be assigned to the sales department.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
