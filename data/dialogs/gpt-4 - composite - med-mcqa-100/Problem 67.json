While infection is a common complication, hemorrhage is considered a major complication due to its potential severity and life-threatening nature.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Confusion between common and major complications\n- Surgical complications\nSolution:\nCyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic pseudocysts. The major complications of this procedure can include infection, obstruction, fistula formation, and hemorrhage. However, the major complication, which is the most severe and potentially life-threatening, is hemorrhage. Therefore, the correct answer is \"[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\".\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question and what it is asking for. In this case, it is asking for the major complication, not the most common one.\n2. Recall the complications of the surgical procedure in question.\n3. Differentiate between common and major complications. Major complications are those that are severe and potentially life-threatening.\n4. Choose the answer that corresponds to the major complication.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking for.\n- Be aware of the difference between common and major complications in medical procedures.\n- Always recall the specific details related to the topic in question.\n- Double-check your answer before finalizing it to ensure it matches the question's requirements.\n"
