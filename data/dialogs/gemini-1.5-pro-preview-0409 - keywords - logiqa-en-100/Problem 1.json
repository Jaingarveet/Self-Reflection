I probably focused too much on the \"access to higher education through fair competition\" part and neglected the importance of compulsory education for all. This led me to a reading comprehension error where I failed to grasp the true essence of a \"reasonable education system\" as described in the context. \n## Answering the Question:\nThe context clearly states that a reasonable education system **requires everyone to have the right to compulsory education**. Therefore, an education system that doesn't fulfill this requirement is unreasonable.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
