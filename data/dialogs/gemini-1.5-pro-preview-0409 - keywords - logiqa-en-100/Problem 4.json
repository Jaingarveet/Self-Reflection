Therefore, **F must be the third speaker.**\n3. **Only one speaker is between M and N.** Since F is the third speaker and J is the fourth, M and N must be the remaining speakers (fifth and sixth). Their order doesn't affect who the third speaker is.\nTherefore, the third speaker must be F. \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
