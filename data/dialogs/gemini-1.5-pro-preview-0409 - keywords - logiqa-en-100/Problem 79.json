        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Error:\nMy previous error likely stemmed from misinterpreting the core argument and the nature of the counter-arguments. The key point is that the argument attempts to justify the existence of the external world based on personal visual experiences and shared knowledge. Therefore, effective rebuttals should challenge the reliability of these justifications or present alternative explanations.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n* **A:** This directly challenges the premise by pointing out circular reasoning. It questions the assumption that sensory experiences automatically validate the external world's existence. \n* **B:** This casts doubt on the claim of shared visual experiences, a supporting point in the argument. \n* **C:** This statement reinforces the argument by asserting the reliability of visual experiences. It does not offer a counter-argument.\n* **D:** This challenges the argument by highlighting the practical success of natural science, which relies on the assumption of an external world.  \n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, option C strengthens the argument instead of refuting it. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
