So, the middle position in Team 1 must be Q.\n* **Condition (2):** If K plays, he must be in the middle. Since Q is already in the middle of Team 1, K cannot be in Team 1.\n* **Condition (4):** Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. Since K is not in Team 1, N can be in Team 1.\n* **Condition (5):** P cannot be in the same team as Q. Since Q is in Team 1, P cannot be in Team 1.\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A:** L, Q, N - This option satisfies all the conditions and deductions made above.\n* **B:** G, K, N - This option violates condition (2) as K cannot be in the middle of Team 1.\n* **C:** L, Q, G - This option satisfies the conditions.\n* **D:** G, K, L - This option violates condition (2) as K cannot be in the middle of Team 1.\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth options A and C satisfy the given conditions. However, without further information or tiebreakers, I cannot definitively choose between them. \n**Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer with the given information.** \n"
