However, we already know from (2) that K must be used, so G must also be used.\n5. **Therefore, no J:** Since G is used, statement (2) tells us that J cannot be used.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is: **No paper J, but paper K.** \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
