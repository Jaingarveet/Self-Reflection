This leaves space for H, but we still need to fulfill conditions 2 and 3.  So, this option is **unlikely**.\n* **B: G and J:** If J is in, then G must be in (from condition 3). This fulfills conditions 2 and 3, leaving one spot which could be filled by either E or F (condition 1). This option is **possible**.\n* **C: G and M:** If M is in, then F cannot be (from condition 4). This leaves space for G, but we still need to fulfill conditions 2 and 3. So, this option is **unlikely**.\n* **D: H and M:** If M is in, then F cannot be (from condition 4). This leaves space for H, but we still need to fulfill conditions 2 and 3. So, this option is **unlikely**.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only combination that definitively fulfills all given conditions is **G and J**.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
