This weakens the argument that a growing number of wealthy Chinese are transferring assets. \n* **Choice C:** This option talks about real estate speculation among wealthy Chinese but doesn't directly address their motivation for investing in the US market. It doesn't necessarily contradict the idea of wealth transfer.\n* **Choice D:** This option highlights the attractiveness of the US real estate market for investment purposes but doesn't provide a counter-argument to the claim about wealth transfer. \n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, **Choice ?** seems to be the most effective counter-argument as it directly challenges the connection between increased investment and a growing number of wealthy Chinese transferring assets abroad.\n**Action: Answer(\"?\")** \n"
