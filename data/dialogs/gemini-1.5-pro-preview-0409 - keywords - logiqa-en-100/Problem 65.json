I focused on the survey results without considering the bigger picture of expert opinions and potential underlying factors.\n## Analysis:\nThe inconsistency lies between the survey results (similar accident rates) and the expert belief (strict investigation reduces accidents). We need to find an option that bridges this gap.\n*   **A:** This doesn't explain the inconsistency; it just restates the scenario.\n*   **B:** This is likely true but doesn't explain why accident rates are similar despite the investigations. \n*   **C:** This might be true, but it doesn't directly address the inconsistency regarding drunk driving investigations.\n*   **D:** This option introduces the possibility of other factors influencing accident rates, potentially explaining the similar rates despite strict drunk driving investigations. \n## Conclusion:\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
