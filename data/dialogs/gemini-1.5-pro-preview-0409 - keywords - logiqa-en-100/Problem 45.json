It focuses on the practical purpose of deductions, not the perceived honor of paying taxes.\n* **B:** This statement directly contradicts the official's claim by suggesting that low taxes, not high taxes, could also affect the \"honor\" of being a taxpayer. This seems like a strong contender.\n* **C:** While true, this statement focuses on the economic function of income tax, not the concept of \"honor\" in paying taxes. It doesn't directly challenge the official's argument.\n* **D:** This statement is likely true and highlights the fact that people contribute to the state through other forms of taxes. However, it doesn't directly address the \"honor\" of income tax specifically.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, **Choice B** seems most likely to raise doubts about the official's argument by directly contradicting the idea that a higher deduction threshold diminishes the \"honor\" of paying taxes.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
