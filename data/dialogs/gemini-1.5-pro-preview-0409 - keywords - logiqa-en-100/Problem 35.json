However, I can still approach this problem step-by-step using the given context and clues to arrive at the correct answer.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Three employers and five graduates:** We know there are three employers (Tianshu, Tianji, Tianxuan) and five graduates (Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, Liu). Each employer hired at least one graduate.\n2. **Clue (1):** Li was hired by Tianshu. This leaves four graduates for the remaining two employers.\n3. **Clue (2):** Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. So, Zhao cannot be in Tianshu.\n4. **Clue (3):** Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. This means they are either both in Tianji or both in Tianxuan.\n5. **Clue (4):** If Zhang is in Tianxuan, then Wang is also in Tianxuan. This is a conditional statement, not a certainty.\n## Evaluating Choices:\nA. **Li and Liu were hired by the same unit:** This contradicts clue (1) as Li is in Tianshu and Liu cannot be there due to clue (3). So, this is **incorrect**.\nB. **Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji:** This is possible as it doesn't contradict any of the clues. We know Zhao and Liu are together, and Wang could be with them in Tianji. So, this **may be correct**.\nC. **Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan:** This contradicts clue (3) as Zhao must be with Liu. So, this is **incorrect**.\nD. **Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan:** This is possible only if Zhang is not in Tianxuan (based on clue 4). So, this **may be correct**.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, both options B and D are possible scenarios and do not contradict the given information. Therefore, the answer should include both of these possibilities.\n**Action: Answer(\"[B, D]\")** \n"
