After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the argument's assumption.\n\nThe correct answer is (A): Before deciding whether to steal something from someone else, a person can know exactly how long he can live.\n\nThe argument relies on the assumption that a person's lifespan determines whether it is beneficial for them to steal from others. The argument states that if a person only lived for one day, it would be best for them to steal, as they would not suffer the fear of being caught. However, if a person can still live for 20 years, it is not beneficial for them to steal, as they will suffer the fear of being caught.\n\nTherefore, the assumption is that a person can know exactly how long they can live before deciding whether to steal from someone else. This assumption allows the argument to make the distinction between a person's lifespan and their decision to steal.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and correct my mistake."
