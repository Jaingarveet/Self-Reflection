After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of careful reading and understanding of the question.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) Only black athletes can become track and field champions.\n\nLiu Xiang's words \"Who said Asians can't be the sprint king?!\" and \"Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be behind black athletes\" suggest that he is challenging the idea that only black athletes can be successful in track and field events. He is implying that people of other races, including Asians, can also excel in these events.\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the best answer, as it is the assertion that Liu Xiang is directly rebutting with his words.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
