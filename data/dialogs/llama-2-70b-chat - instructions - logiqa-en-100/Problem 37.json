I thought that the statement \"Industrial pollution threatens its air, water, and buildings\" meant that the pollution was the only factor affecting the natural environment, and therefore, the quality of life in Huaizhou City would depend only on its economic growth and natural living environment.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realized that the statement \"Industrial pollution threatens its air, water, and buildings\" indicates that the natural environment is not separate from the economic development, but rather, it is affected by it. The development of industry in Huaizhou City is necessary for jobs and wages for residents, but it also produces pollution that threatens the natural environment. Therefore, the quality of life in Huaizhou City cannot be separated from its economic growth and natural living environment.\n\nThe correct answer, B, accurately reflects this relationship between economic development and the natural environment. The statement \"Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment\" acknowledges that the city's economic growth and natural environment are interconnected and that a problem in one area will affect the other.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment."
