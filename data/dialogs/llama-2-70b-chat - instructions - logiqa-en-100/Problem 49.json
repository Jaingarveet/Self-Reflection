After reevaluating the information, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect.\n\nThe relevant words in the cryptographic language are \"Doximayo,\" \"Mugbudengs,\" and \"Huholikaso.\"\n\nBased on the context, \"Doximayo\" can't mean \"student\" because it's used in the phrase \"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey,\" which means \"kidnapping student (host) hostage.\" Therefore, \"Doximayo\" must mean \"hostage.\"\n\n\"Mugbudengs\" is used in the phrase \"Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits,\" which means \"kidnapping reporters away.\" Therefore, \"Mugbudengs\" must mean \"kidnapping.\"\n\n\"Huholikaso\" is used in the phrase \"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs,\" which means \"hostage holding (see) \"Reporter.\" Therefore, \"Huholikaso\" must mean \"holding.\"\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nThe meaning of \"Doximayo\" is indeed \"hostage,\" making statement A true."
