After reevaluating the question and the given choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Xinjiang salamander is a kind of animal that is afraid of light. Most of them hide under the rocks of the creek during the day, and avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep.\n\nThis choice raises the most doubts about the opinions of the experts, as it suggests that the northern salamanders in Xinjiang are not necessarily threatened by the trampling of cattle and sheep, as they are able to hide under rocks and avoid them. This contradicts the experts' belief that the habitat of the northern salamander in Xinjiang was originally a local pasture, and the cattle and sheep walking around on the grassland in summer will trample them to death, resulting in a sharp decline in their numbers.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
