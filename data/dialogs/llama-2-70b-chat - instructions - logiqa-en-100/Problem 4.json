F (first or third place)\n2. G (must speak before lunch)\n3. J (fourth speaker)\n4. L (only one speaker between M and N)\n5. M (speaks after lunch)\n6. N (speaks after lunch)\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n1. Since F must speak in the first or third place, and G must speak before lunch, F must be the first speaker.\n2. G must speak before lunch, so G is the second speaker.\n3. J is the fourth speaker, so J must speak after lunch.\n4. L is between M and N, so L must be the fifth speaker.\n5. M and N must speak after lunch, so M is the third speaker, and N is the sixth speaker.\n\nDouble-checking my calculations, I confirm that the order of the speakers is correct:\nF, G, M, J, L, N\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: G or L.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
