The statement \"F and M are not in charge of the same department\" provides crucial information that can help us determine the correct answer.\n\nLet's revisit the problem and consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. F is in charge of Department 1, and M is in charge of Department 2. In this case, Condition 1 is violated since F and M are not in charge of the same department.\n2. F is in charge of Department 2, and M is in charge of Department 1. This scenario also violates Condition 1.\n3. F is in charge of Department 1, and M is in charge of Department 3. This satisfies Condition 1, but it also means that H and I must be in charge of Departments 2 and 3, respectively, which violates Condition 3.\n4. F is in charge of Department 3, and M is in charge of Department 1. This satisfies Condition 1, but it also means that H and I must be in charge of Departments 1 and 2, respectively, which violates Condition 3.\n5. F is in charge of Department 2, and M is in charge of Department 3. This satisfies Condition 1 and does not violate Conditions 2 or 3.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: F and I are in charge of the same department.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
