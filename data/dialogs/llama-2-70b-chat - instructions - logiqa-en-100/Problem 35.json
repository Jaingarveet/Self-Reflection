After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the information provided.\n\nThe statement \"If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan\" implies that Zhang and Wang are not hired by the same unit. Therefore, we can deduce that Zhang was not hired by Tianji, as otherwise, Wang would have been hired by Tianxuan.\n\nWith this information, we can now determine that Li and Liu were hired by the same unit, which is Tianji. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
