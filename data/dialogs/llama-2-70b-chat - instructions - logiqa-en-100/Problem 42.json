After reevaluating the information provided, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\nHere's my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:\nThe correct answer is D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago.\nThe argument states that the cave was not accidentally discovered until the 1950s, implying that it was not accessible to people for a long time. If the entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago, it would explain why the cave was not discovered until the 20th century. This would refute the argument that hundreds of people had lived in the cave, as it would have been inaccessible for a significant period.\nTherefore, the answer is D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
