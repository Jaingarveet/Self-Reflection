Read the passage carefully and understand the argument made.\n2. Identify the assumption upon which the argument relies.\n3. Evaluate the assumption and determine whether it is valid.\n4. Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the assumption.\n5. Consider alternative perspectives and evaluate their implications.\n"
