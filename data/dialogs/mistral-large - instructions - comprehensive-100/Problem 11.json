Read the question carefully and understand the assertion being made.\n2. Consider each choice and the information it provides.\n3. Compare the information in each choice to the assertion.\n4. Determine which choice casts the most doubt on the assertion.\n5. Choose the answer that corresponds to that choice.\n"

I mistakenly thought that the increase in housing prices in Shanghai was greater than the increase in land prices, which would cast doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. However, I failed to consider that the increase in land prices in Shanghai was still significant and could still be a contributing factor to the rise in housing prices.\n\nUpon re-evaluating the choices, I realized that choice C is the most doubtful of the assertion. The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate's belief that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase is not necessarily true. There could be other factors that contribute to the rise in housing prices, such as demand or speculation.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
