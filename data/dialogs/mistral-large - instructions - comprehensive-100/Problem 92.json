Dermoid cysts are teratomas that contain various tissue types and can grow large, but they are also less likely to undergo torsion.\n3. Theca lutein cysts are functional cysts that develop due to hormonal stimulation and are more likely to undergo torsion during pregnancy due to their rapid growth and size.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
