The length of line segment RU is not the length of line segment RS plus the length of line segment SU, but rather the length of line segment RT minus the length of line segment TU.\nThe length of line segment RT is 17, and the length of line segment TU is the same as the length of line segment SU, which is 11.\nTherefore, the length of line segment RU is 17 - 11 = 6.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
