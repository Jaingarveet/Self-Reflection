Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the three types of robots and their abilities.\n3. Analyze the results of the experiment and what they imply about each robot's abilities.\n4. Consider all possibilities and do not make assumptions about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes.\n5. Eliminate answer choices that cannot be true based on the information given.\n6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the information given.\n"

Type A robots can recognize colors, type B robots can recognize shapes, and type C robots can neither recognize colors nor shapes.\n3. Robot 1 picked up red squares when ordered to pick up red balls, which means it can recognize color but not shape. Therefore, it cannot be type C, and it cannot be type B. It must be type A.\n4. Robot 2 picked up blue balls when ordered to pick up red balls, which means it can recognize shape but not color. Therefore, it cannot be type C, and it cannot be type A. It must be type B.\n5. Based on the above analysis, choice C must be true.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\n\nPreviously, I made the mistake of assuming that the robots' mistakes in the experiment meant they could not recognize either color or shape. However, upon closer analysis, I realized that their mistakes actually revealed their abilities. By carefully considering each robot's actions and eliminating impossible answer choices, I was able to arrive at the correct answer."
