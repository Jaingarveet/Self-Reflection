Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the logical issue in the given statements.\n3. Analyze each answer choice and determine if it logically addresses the issue.\n4.

I thought that the issue was with the truth value of the statements, but the real issue was that they led to an absurd conclusion. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that the correct answer is the one that shows why the conclusion is invalid."
