Let's analyze each option:\n*   **Anteroposterior and Lateral X-rays:** These are fundamental for visualizing vertebral alignment and identifying the slippage characteristic of Spondylolisthesis. \n*   **CT scans:** Provide detailed bony anatomy, aiding in classifying the type of Spondylolisthesis and assessing any associated fractures.\n*   **MRI:** Offers superior visualization of soft tissues, including the spinal cord, nerve roots, and intervertebral discs, which is crucial for evaluating potential neurological involvement or disc-related issues contributing to the condition.\nConsidering the comprehensive information provided by each modality, it's unlikely that any would be entirely useless. However, one might be less frequently used or have limitations in certain scenarios. \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
