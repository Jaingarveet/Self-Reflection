Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

We need to find a statement that contradicts this argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nOption B states that a low personal income tax will also affect the honor of low-income earners as taxpayers. This statement contradicts the official's argument that a high starting point for personal income tax will deprive low-income earners of the honor of being the most taxpayers.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I did not carefully read and analyze each option. \nOption B is not a contradiction to the official's argument, but rather a similar statement that supports the idea that low-income earners should also be recognized as taxpayers. \nOption D is the correct answer because it raises doubts about the official's argument by suggesting that China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes, not personal income tax. Therefore, the argument that a high starting point for personal income tax will deprive low-income earners of the honor of being the most taxpayers may not be valid in the context of China's tax system. \nError Keywords:\n - Misreading options\n - Incorrectly identifying contradictions\n - Lack of attention to detail\nSolution:\nOption D is the correct answer because it raises doubts about the official's argument by suggesting that China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes, not personal income tax.

Read each option carefully and analyze its meaning.\n2. Identify the option that contradicts or raises doubts about the argument presented in the question.\n3. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is a valid contradiction or doubt.\n4. Choose the option that best fits the question.\nAdvice:\n - Always read each option carefully and analyze its meaning.\n - Pay attention to details and nuances in the language used in the question and options.\n - Look for options that directly contradict or raise doubts about the argument presented in the question.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure that it is a valid contradiction or doubt."
