Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This is not supported by the passage. \nThe correct answer is D because the passage states that in a solid cultural environment, people are not overbearing and have good morality. However, being careful and meticulous does not necessarily mean a person has good morality. Therefore, it cannot be derived that if a person is immoral, he is overbearing and careful.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Incorrect deduction\n - Unsupported conclusion\nSolution:\nThe passage states that in a solid cultural environment, people know how to respect themselves, others, and nature.
