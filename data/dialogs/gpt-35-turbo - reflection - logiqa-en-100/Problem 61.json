Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nMy mistake was that I did not consider all the possible combinations of departments that F and M could be in charge of. \nThe correct answer is C because if F and M are in different departments, then F and I cannot be in the same department, and I and P cannot be in the same department. Therefore, I and P must be in the same department.\nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Insufficient consideration of possibilities\n - Overconfidence in initial analysis\nSolution:\nIf F and M are not in charge of the same department, then F and M are in charge of different departments.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that H and I are not in charge of the same department.\nTherefore, F and I cannot be in the same department.\nAlso, if F and M are in different departments, then P cannot be in the same department as either F or M.\nTherefore, I and P must be in the same department.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify all the given conditions and constraints.\n3. Consider all possible combinations of departments that F and M could be in charge of.\n4. Use the given conditions to eliminate impossible combinations.\n5. Choose the answer that must be true based on the remaining possible combinations.\n6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n7.
