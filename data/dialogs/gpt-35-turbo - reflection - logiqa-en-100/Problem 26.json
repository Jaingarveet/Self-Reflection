Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of \"friends are like dung\".\nQuestion: Since the conclusion of \"friends like dung\" is not true, it can be logically derived?\nChoices:\n  A: The expression \"money is like dung\" is false.\n  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.\n  C: The statement that \"friends are valuable\" is true.\n  D: The words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false.\n\nThought:\nThe question is asking which statement can be logically derived from the fact that the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true.\nIf \"friends are like dung\" is not true, then it must be false that \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\".\nTherefore, the statement \"friends are valuable\" is not necessarily true.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nThe correct answer is B because it provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true. If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. This statement provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true. The fact that \"friends are valuable\" is not necessarily true, as it depends on the context and the specific friend in question. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Option A is not relevant to the logical problem at hand, and option D is too general and does not provide a specific logical explanation for the problem. \nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the logical problem\n - Incorrectly assuming the truth of a statement\n - Incorrectly assuming the falsity of a statement\nSolution:\nIf \"friends are like dung\" is not true, then it must be false that \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\". This is because the two statements are logically equivalent. If one is false, then the other must also be false. Therefore, the statement \"friends are valuable\" is not necessarily true. However, if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. This statement provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the logical problem.\n2. Identify the conclusion that is not true.\n3. Determine the logical relationship between the conclusion and the given statements.\n4. Consider each option and determine if it provides a logical explanation for the problem.\n5. Choose the option that provides the most logical explanation for the problem.\n6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the correct answer.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the logical problem.\n - Always consider the logical relationship between the given statements and the conclusion.\n - Never assume the truth or falsity of a statement without logical justification.\n - Always consider all options and choose the one that provides the most logical explanation for the problem.\n - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy."
