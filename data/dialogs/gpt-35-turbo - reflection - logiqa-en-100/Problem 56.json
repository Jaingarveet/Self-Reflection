        "content": "Explanation:\nI chose option B as it suggests that most international ships do not need to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, which contradicts the expert's point of view. However, option D is a stronger statement that directly contradicts the expert's point of view by stating that 8000-ton ships have already passed through the Nanjing Bridge. This suggests that the bridge may not need to be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of options\n - Weak contradiction\n - Failure to identify a stronger contradiction\nSolution:\nThe expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely. \nOption D directly contradicts the expert's point of view by stating that 8000-ton ships have already passed through the Nanjing Bridge.
