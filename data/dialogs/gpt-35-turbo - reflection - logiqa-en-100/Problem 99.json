Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The views of ordinary people are that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\". Therefore, the correct answer should provide evidence against the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption A talks about the limitations of artificial genetic screening, but it does not refute the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption B talks about the potential risks of technological development, but it does not refute the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption C distinguishes between gene screening and eugenics, but it does not refute the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nOption D suggests that \"customized babies\" have not been tried globally and challenges human reproductive ethics, which provides evidence against the possibility of \"customized babies\".\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
