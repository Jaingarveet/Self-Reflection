Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This would weaken the argument that seals caused the reduction of crocodiles.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Identify the common food source for crocodiles and seals.\n2. Evaluate the impact of shared food sources on the population dynamics of both species.\n3. Consider alternative factors that may affect the population of crocodiles, such as environmental changes or overfishing.\n4. Re-assess the argument that seals caused the reduction of crocodiles in light of the new information.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Always consider all relevant factors that may affect the relationship between different species.\n2. Evaluate the impact of shared resources on population dynamics.\n3. Avoid oversimplifying complex ecological relationships.\n4. Consider alternative explanations for population changes.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is based on accurate information and sound logic.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always approach ecological problems with a holistic perspective.\n - Consider the interconnectedness of different species and their environments.\n - Avoid jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.\n - Be open to alternative explanations and consider their validity.\n - Use a systematic approach to evaluate complex ecological relationships."
