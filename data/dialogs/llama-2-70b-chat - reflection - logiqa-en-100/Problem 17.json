Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, choice B reveals that there are additional costs associated with maintaining the aluminum alloy armored vehicles, which were not considered in the initial statement. This additional cost could potentially offset the financial benefits of using aluminum alloy armored vehicles, and therefore, raise doubts about the conclusion.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

However, choice A reveals that the running cost of the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is significantly lower than that of the steel armored vehicle, which was not considered in the initial statement. This lower running cost could potentially offset the higher manufacturing cost, making the aluminum alloy armored vehicle a more cost-effective option in the long run. Therefore, choice A raises doubts about the conclusion that it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles with the same protective properties."
