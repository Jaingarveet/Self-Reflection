Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Please judge with someone who shares your opinion.Since he has the same opinion as you, how can he judge? Please judge by someone who has the same opinion as me.Since he has the same opinion as me, how can he judge? Please judge with people who have different opinions from you and me.Since he has different opinions from you and me, how can he judge? Therefore, \"invincible\".\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately describes the shortcomings of the above argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The above argument seriously ignores the implementation standards and logical standards beyond the debaters and commentators.\n  B: The above argument has a logical error of \"confused concept\".\n  C: The reasons in the above argument are untrue and inconsistent with each other.\n  D: The above argument is guilty of a \"mis-problem\" logical error.\n\n  Answer: \nThe above argument is guilty of a \"mis-problem\" logical error.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument is based on the premise that we cannot judge between true and false because everyone has prejudices. However, this premise is flawed because it assumes that having prejudices means that we cannot make objective judgments. In reality, people can still make informed and objective decisions despite having prejudices. Additionally, the argument's conclusion that \"invincible\" is the best description of the situation is not logically supported by the premises. Therefore, option D is the best answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

The argument also assumes that having prejudices means that objective judgments cannot be made, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
