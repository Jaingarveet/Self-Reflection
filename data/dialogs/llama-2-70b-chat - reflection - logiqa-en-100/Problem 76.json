Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, this premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Taiwanese are not Chinese. Being Chinese refers to a person's ethnicity, culture, or nationality, which is not determined by their political status or jurisdiction. Therefore, the argument is not valid.\n\nThe closest analogy to this argument is choice B. The argument that air is a commodity because it has use value is flawed. Air is not a commodity in the classical sense, as it is not something that can be bought or sold. Similarly, the argument that Taiwanese are not Chinese because they are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is also flawed, as it is based on a faulty premise.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
