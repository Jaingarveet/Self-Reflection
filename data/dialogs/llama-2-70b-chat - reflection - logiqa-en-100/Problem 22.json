Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Last year, the national consumer price index (CPI) rose only 1.8%, which is a moderate increase.However, people's personal feelings are quite different.They feel that water, electricity, gas, vegetables, oil, going to school to see a doctor, and buying a house by car are all rising prices, and the increase is not \"moderate.\"\nQuestion: Which of the following options does not help explain the gap between the statistics in the question and the people â€™s feelings?\nChoices:\n  A: China's current CPI statistical range and standards were formulated more than 20 years ago, and it is difficult to truly reflect the current trend of consumer prices.\n  B: The CPI published by the National Bureau of Statistics is a data description of the overall situation of the prices of various goods and services across the country, and it cannot fully reflect individual feelings and the differences between regions and consumption levels.\n  C: Products with a high degree of relevance to people's lives tend to increase prices; those with a low degree of relevance tend to fall prices.\n  D: High-income groups have little sense of a small price increase.\n\n  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nOption C does not help explain the gap between the statistics in the question and the people's feelings. The statement suggests that products with a high degree of relevance to people's lives tend to increase in price, while those with a low degree of relevance tend to fall in price. However, this does not address why people might perceive price increases differently than what is reflected in the CPI statistics.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, suggests that the CPI statistical range and standards used in China were formulated over 20 years ago and may not accurately reflect current trends in consumer prices. This could contribute to a gap between the official statistics and people's perceptions of price increases.\n\nOption B states that the CPI published by the National Bureau of Statistics is a data description of the overall situation of prices of various goods and services across the country, and it cannot fully reflect individual feelings and regional differences. This option also acknowledges a potential gap between the statistics and people's perceptions.\n\nOption D suggests that high-income groups may not perceive small price increases as significant, which could contribute to a gap between the official statistics and people's feelings. However, this option does not directly address the issue of why people might perceive price increases differently than what is reflected in the CPI statistics.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
