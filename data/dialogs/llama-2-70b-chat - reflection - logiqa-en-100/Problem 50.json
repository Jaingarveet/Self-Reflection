Read the rules provided carefully and understand them.\n2. Identify the first valve that must be opened.\n3. Determine which valve must be opened or closed based on the rules.\n4. Identify the second valve that must be opened.\n5. Check that the chosen valves do not violate rule 3.\n6. Answer the question based on the valves that have been opened.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the rules provided may have exceptions or special cases, so be sure to consider all possibilities.\n - When dealing with multiple rules, ensure that you apply them in the correct order."
