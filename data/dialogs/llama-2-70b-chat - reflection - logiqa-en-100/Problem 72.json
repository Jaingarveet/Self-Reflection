Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: In the 110-meter hurdles competition at the Olympic Games, Liu Xiang won the championship and broke the Olympic record, tying the world record.He said to reporters? \"Who said Asians can't be the sprint king ?! As long as I am there! You believe me!\", \"Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years.Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old Behind black athletes, from me, a new chapter will be written! \"\nQuestion: The fact that Liu Xiang won the championship and his words do not constitute a rebuttal to which of the following assertions?\nChoices:\n  A: Only black athletes can become track and field champions.\n  B: All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players.\n  C: Most track and field champions are black athletes.\n  D: If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent.\n\n  Answer: \"B: All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players.\"\n\nExplanation:\nLiu Xiang's victory and statement do not refute the claim that all sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players because Liu Xiang, a yellow-skinned athlete, has become a sprint king. His statement, \"Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old behind black athletes,\" implies that he believes yellow-skinned athletes can also excel in sprint events, but it does not directly address the assertion that all sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

His statement, \"Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years,\" acknowledges the dominance of black athletes in the sport. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nThe error in the previous response was due to a misunderstanding of the question. The question asked for the assertion that Liu Xiang's victory and statement do not refute, but the previous response incorrectly identified the assertion that Liu Xiang's victory and statement actually support."
