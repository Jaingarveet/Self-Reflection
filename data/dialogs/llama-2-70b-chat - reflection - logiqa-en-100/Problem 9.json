(1) Each group has at least 3 employees .(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.\nQuestion: If the members of the printing group are composed of F, H, L, and M, and the members of the binding group are composed of G, H, and J, then K can replace which member of the two groups without violating any of the given conditions?\nChoices:\n  A: F\n  B: G\n  C: H\n  D: L\n\n  Thought: \nWe can start by analyzing the given conditions:\n* Condition 1: Both groups must have at least 3 employees, so F, H, L, and M in the printing group, and G, H, and J in the binding group meet this condition.\n* Condition 2: F and K cannot be in the same group. Since K is not in the printing group, this condition is met.\n* Condition 3: If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Since K is not in the printing group, this condition is met.\n* Condition 4: M is at least one of the members of these two groups. M is in the printing group, so this condition is met.\n* Condition 5: At least one of the same employees in both groups. H is in both groups, so this condition is met.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: If the members of the printing group are composed of F, H, L, and M, and the members of the binding group are composed of G, H, and J, then K can replace which member of the two groups without violating any of the given conditions?\n\nWe can see that K can replace H in either group without violating any of the conditions. H is in both groups, so replacing H with K in either group will still meet condition 5. Conditions 1, 3, and 4 are also met since the number of employees in each group remains the same, and M is still a member of one of the groups. Condition 2 is also met since F and K are not in the same group.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
