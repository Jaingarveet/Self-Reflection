Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Research has found that insects “breathe” through the stomata system on their bodies.The stomata are connected to the trachea, and more and more layers of smaller and smaller air are attached from top to bottom, thereby bringing oxygen to the whole body.At the current level of oxygen in the atmosphere, the total length of the stomata system has reached the limit; if the total length exceeds this limit, the oxygen supply capacity will be insufficient.Therefore, it can be judged that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Studies of invertebrates in the ocean have also found that in colder water and with higher oxygen content, the organisms there are also larger\n  B: During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth ’s atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%.At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter.\n  C: Small locusts cannot survive in a low-oxygen environment, especially in an environment with an oxygen concentration below 15%.Adult locusts can survive in an environment with 2% oxygen\n  D: Under the environment with high oxygen content and high air pressure, the tested fruit flies lived to the fifth generation and their body size increased by 20%\n\n  Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement that during the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere was much higher than it is today, and there were many giant insects on earth, supports the argument that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects. This is because it suggests that when oxygen levels were higher, larger insects were able to exist, whereas at current oxygen levels, the total length of the stomata system has reached its limit, suggesting that larger insects cannot survive. Therefore, choice B provides evidence that oxygen levels can impact the size of insects, supporting the argument.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
