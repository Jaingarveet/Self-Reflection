Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This implies that the city's economic growth and natural environment are interconnected and that a problem in one area will affect the other. Therefore, if the city's industry, which is the backbone of its economy, inevitably produces pollution, it is likely that the city will face problems such as stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the quality of life in Huaizhou depends only on economic growth and natural living environment, but the given information indicates that the city's development also depends on industry, which affects both economic growth and the natural environment.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it states that the economic environment of Huaizhou has deteriorated in recent years, but the given information does not provide information about the current state of the city's economy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that the pollution of air, water, and buildings in Huaizhou City is mainly caused by chemical companies, but the given information does not provide information about the specific causes of pollution in the city.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
