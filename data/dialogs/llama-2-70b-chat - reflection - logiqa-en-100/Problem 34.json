Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the meaning of the sentence \"Do not do what you don't want to do to others.\" I thought it implied that we should treat others the way we want to be treated, but it actually means that we should not do something to others that we would not want done to ourselves.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation\n* Inference\n* Treat others\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is B: If you want, then give it to others. This option is a logical inference from the original sentence because it suggests that if you want something for yourself, you should also be willing to give it to others. This is in line with the idea of treating others the way you would want to be treated.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the original sentence carefully and understand its meaning.\n2. Identify the logical relationship between the original sentence and each option.\n3. Choose the option that logically follows from the original sentence.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the original sentence.\n* Identify the logical relationship between the original sentence and each option.\n* Use the process of elimination to eliminate options that are not logically related to the original sentence.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it logically follows from the original sentence.\n* Remember that the Golden Rule is a principle of treating others as you would want to be treated, not necessarily what they want."
