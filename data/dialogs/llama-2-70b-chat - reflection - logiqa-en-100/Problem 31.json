Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This contradicts the opinion that sand and dust storms are inevitable natural disasters caused by climate drought and grassland degradation. Therefore, option D can question the opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, options A, B, and C provide evidence that grassland degradation is a significant issue in the region. Option A notes that the grass in Xilin Gol grassland has decreased significantly over time. Option B highlights the contrast between the degraded grasslands in Hulunbeier and Xilinguole and the healthier grasslands in Mongolia. Option C suggests that even in uninhabited areas, the grasslands have not been maintained. While these options provide context for the issue of grassland degradation, they do not directly challenge the opinion that sand and dust storms are inevitable natural disasters.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
