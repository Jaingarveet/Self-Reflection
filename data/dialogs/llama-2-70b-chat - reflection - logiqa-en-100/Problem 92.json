Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

Professor Zhao said? \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.\" Professor Qian said ? \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.\" Professor Sun said? \"The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.\nQuestion: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is\nChoices:\n  A: Tsinghua University Team\n  B: China University of Science and Technology Team\n  C: Zhejiang University Team\n  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n  Thought: \nAccording to the given information, Professor Zhao's statement eliminates the Tsinghua University team and the Zhejiang University team. Professor Qian's statement eliminates the Tsinghua University team but implies that the University of Science and Technology of China team will win. Professor Sun's statement eliminates the China University of Science and Technology team and implies that the Tsinghua University team will win. Since only one of the professors made a correct judgment, and one of their judgments is one-to-one wrong, the winner cannot be the Tsinghua University team or the China University of Science and Technology team. Therefore, the winner must be either the Zhejiang University team or the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.
