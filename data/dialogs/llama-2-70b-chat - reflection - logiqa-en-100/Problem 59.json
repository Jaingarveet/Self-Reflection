Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and the other three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?\nChoices:\n  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X\n  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y\n  C: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, Y, W\n  D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department?
