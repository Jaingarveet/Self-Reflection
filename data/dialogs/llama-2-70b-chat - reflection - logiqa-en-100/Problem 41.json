Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This implies that if the company fails to increase productivity by 20%, it will not achieve its goal and will go bankrupt. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\n\nA: This statement is not necessarily true. Even if Green Island fails to achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it may still be able to avoid bankruptcy if it increases productivity by 10%.\n\nC: This statement is false. According to the argument, Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy, regardless of whether the market changes.\n\nD: This statement is impossible. If Green Island increases productivity by 10% over the next two years, it will have achieved its goal of increasing productivity by 20%.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
