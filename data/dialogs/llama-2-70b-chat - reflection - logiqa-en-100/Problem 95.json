Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the question and options, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is indeed D: Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high.\n\nPremier Wen Jiabao's statement is a metaphorical expression, suggesting that when a large number of people work together, even a small task can become significant. The phrase \"everyone collects firewood and the flame is high\" is a Chinese idiom that means when many people work together, they can achieve great things.\n\nOption D is the best match for the statement given by Premier Wen Jiabao, as it conveys a similar message about the power of collective effort.\n\nOption A is not related to the statement given by Premier Wen Jiabao.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it focuses on the complexity and difficulty of managing a large population, rather than the collective power of the people.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because it states that China cannot threaten any other country, which is not related to the idea of collective effort.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high."
