However, upon reflection, I realized that Choice A does not match the description of the classic pasteurella infection discharge described in the text. The text does not mention anything about the mucus and blood evaporating out from the nose, nor does it mention the discharge feeling light, pale pink, tender to the touch, or having a yellowish pallor.\n\nTherefore, I have changed my answer to Choice B, which better matches the description of the discharge provided in the text."
