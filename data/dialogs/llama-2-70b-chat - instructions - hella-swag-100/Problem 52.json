[step] One of the most critical aspects to being indie is not adopting other people's views without evaluating the situation yourself. Going with the crowd is never something that an indie person would do, so make sure that you are making independent decisions when it comes to music, clothing, and your opinions.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Understand how people may affect how you think about the music and related trends. [title] Steer clear of the \" what's indie, what's indie-animal \" mentality.\n  B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. [substeps] If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.\n  C: [substeps] Never allow the messenger back into your life. If you are in a relationship with someone but they are choosing to change with you, leave the conversation.\n  D: You don't have to assume how you will feel. What's more, you probably know a bit more about people who just want to blend in with their surroundings.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the main idea of the text and evaluate each choice based on how well it aligns with the text's message.\n3.

The text encourages individuals to make independent decisions and not follow the crowd. Option A suggests avoiding certain topics or people, which goes against the message of independence.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, aligns well with the text's message. It suggests doing research and informing one's opinions, which promotes independent thinking. It also encourages individuals to stand up for their views, even if they go against what others think. This option supports the idea of not conforming to others' opinions and making independent decisions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B."
