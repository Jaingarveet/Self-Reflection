What should Michelle do next?\nChoices:\n  A: perform the investigation in a different way\n  B: change the hypothesis to match the results\n  C: choose a different investigation\n  D: repeat the investigation\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the scientific method's process.

Identify the current step in the scientific method based on the situation.\n4. Determine the next step in the scientific method.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the next step in the scientific method.\nAdvice:\n- Always remember the steps of the scientific method.\n- Understand that if results do not match the hypothesis, the investigation should be repeated to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.\n- Only after repeated inconsistent results should the hypothesis be reconsidered.\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always think through each step of your reasoning.\n"
