[step] The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. Consider stopping caring about your work/colleagues criticism and you might feel more relaxed in the short term.\nChoices:\n  A: Richard templar says in the rules of wealth act as if you don't need the money and people will no longer have power over you. [title] Believe, from deep in your gut, that you can do better.\n  B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.\n  C: [substeps] Don't be afraid to look back on and the future. Remind yourself that it is impossible to work your way to the top, but soon you will be jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl.\n  D: Give your notice to somebody who simply deserves it. This is an integral part of the healthy and productive life you lead.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe given text is written in an exaggerated, satirical style presenting intentionally questionable advice for dealing with a high-pressure job. Clues that this is tongue-in-cheek rather than sincere include:\n- The informal, conversational tone \n- Odd motivational phrases like \"The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go\"\n- The suggestion to \"stop caring\" as a solution\n- The [header] label presenting this as \"How to escape extreme pressure employment\"\nAnswer [REDACTED] provides the best continuation of this satirical tone, with references to acting like you don't need money and believing \"from deep in your gut\" that you can do better. This matches the style of exaggerated, unhelpful advice in the original text.\n"
