This suggests he has finished a game. Then, the man puts the balls in a metal triangle and arranges other balls, indicating he is racking the balls to set up for a new game. \n(A) Putting other balls in the pocket doesn't make sense after racking.\n(B) You don't \"serve\" in pool and opponents don't score each other's balls. \n(C) Pool balls aren't wooden and aren't held in the triangle.\n(D) Striking the cue ball and immediately stopping it with the cue stick is the only choice that could logically follow racking the balls, even though it's an unusual action.\n"
