The ages are in Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months, which is 0.25 years.\n3. The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.\n4. The sum of the ages of all members is 250.\nWe know the formula for the sum of an A.P. is:\nSum = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\nSubstituting the values:\n250 = n/2 * [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n250 = n/2 * [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]\n250 = n/2 * [13.75 + 0.25n]\n500 = n * [13.75 + 0.25n]\n500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2\nThis is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it:\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nn = [-13.75 ± √(13.75^2 - 4*0.25*-500)] / (2*0.25)\n  = [-13.75 ± √(189.0625 + 500)] / 0.5\n  = [-13.75 ± √689.0625] / 0.5\n  = [-13.75 ± 26.25] / 0.5\nThe positive solution is:\nn = (26.25 - 13.75) / 0.5 = 12.5 / 0.5 = 25\nTherefore, the number of members in the club is 25.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
