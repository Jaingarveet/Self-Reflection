Substituting these values:\n   $0 - k = \\frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(0 - 2)$\n   Simplifying:\n   $-k = \\frac{32 - k}{k - 2}(-2)$\n   $-k = \\frac{2k - 64}{k - 2}$\n6) For this to be true, the numerators must be equal:\n   $-k(k - 2) = 2k - 64$\n   $-k^2 + 2k = 2k - 64$\n   $-k^2 = -64$\n   $k^2 = 64$\n   $k = \\pm 8$\n7) Since $k$ is a coordinate, it must be a real number. Therefore, $k$ could be either 8 or -8.\nLooking at the choices, the only value of $k$ that satisfies the equation is 8.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
