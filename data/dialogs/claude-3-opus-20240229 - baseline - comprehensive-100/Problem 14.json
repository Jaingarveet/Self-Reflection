Finance is directly above planning.\n4. Administration is above planning but below HR.\n5. HR is not directly above administration (given in the question).\nLet's try to arrange the departments:\n- Planning must be below finance, administration, and HR.\n- Administration must be above planning but below HR.\n- HR must be above administration, and not adjacent to sales.\nOne possible arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:\n6th floor: HR\n5th floor: R&D or Sales\n4th floor: Administration\n3rd floor: R&D or Sales\n2nd floor: Finance\n1st floor: Planning\nIf sales is on the 5th floor, then R&D must be on the 3rd floor. In this case, sales would be directly above administration, making choice B correct.\nIf sales is on the 3rd floor, then R&D must be on the 5th floor.
