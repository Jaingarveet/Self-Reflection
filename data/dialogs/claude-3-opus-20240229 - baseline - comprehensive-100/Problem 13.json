According to condition (4), only when crossing Mountain I can they reach Lake J.\n3. Therefore, the team cannot visit Lake J.\n4. According to condition (1), the team must visit at least one of Lake G or Lake J.\n5. Since they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit Lake G to satisfy condition (1).\n6. According to condition (2), if they don't go to City E or City F, they can't go to Lake G.\n7. Therefore, to visit Lake G, they must visit at least one of City E or City F.\nLooking at the choices:\nA: This cannot be true because they cannot visit Lake J.\nB: This may or may not be true. They must visit at least one of City E or F, but not necessarily E instead of F.\nC: This may or may not be true. They must visit Lake G, but visiting Mountain H is not necessarily required.\nD: This must be true. They must visit Lake G, and to do so, they must visit at least one of City E or F. This choice states they visited City F and Lake G, which satisfies the conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
