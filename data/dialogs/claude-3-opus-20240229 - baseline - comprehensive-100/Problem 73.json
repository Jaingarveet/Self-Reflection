Air: Air has a low heat capacity, meaning it does not store much thermal energy.\nB. Land: Land (soil and rocks) has a higher heat capacity than air, but not as high as water. It can store some thermal energy, but not as much as oceans.\nC. Oceans: Water has a very high heat capacity, which means it can store a large amount of thermal energy. Oceans cover about 71% of the Earth's surface and have a vast volume, giving them an enormous capacity to store heat from the Sun.\nD. Plants: While plants absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, they do not have a significant capacity for storing thermal energy compared to oceans, land, or air.\nTherefore, the oceans have the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
