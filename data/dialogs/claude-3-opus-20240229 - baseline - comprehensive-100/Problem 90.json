Removing the screen will allow you to completely and easily wash it.\nChoices:\n  A: Make sure any screen you plan on washing has been removed from the window before you being cleaning it. [substeps] The exact method you use to remove the screen will depend on the type of window screen you have.\n  B: [substeps] The easiest way to remove the screen is with a mild dish soap and water. Because the other screens will be facing the same way, it's easier to remove one or both screens at once.\n  C: [substeps] Some windows screens have ctors that you can remove to clean the screen. Wear gloves during this process to prevent yourself from picking up dirt or debris.\n  D: Once it's off you can store it safely on your computer. [title] Clear your screen with a plastic bag.\n"

It also mentions that the removal method depends on the screen type, which makes sense. This is a strong candidate.\nB: Removing the screen with soap and water doesn't make sense - that would be part of the cleaning process, not removal. Mentioning other screens facing the same way also seems irrelevant. This choice is unlikely.\nC: Mentioning screen \"ctors\" (likely a typo for \"sectors\") that can be removed for cleaning is plausible. Wearing gloves to avoid dirt also logically follows. However, this seems to skip ahead to the cleaning process rather than focusing on screen removal. It's a possibility but not the strongest choice.\nD: Storing the screen \"on your computer\" makes no sense for a physical window screen. Clearing the screen with a plastic bag also seems unrelated and illogical. This choice can be ruled out.\nBased on this analysis, choice A is the most coherent and logical next step after the given text, focusing on properly removing the screen before cleaning.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
