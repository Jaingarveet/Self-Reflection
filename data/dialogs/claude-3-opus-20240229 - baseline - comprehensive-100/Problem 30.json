At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.\n2. G is placed on the top shelf.\n3. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Since there are 8 books total and at least 2 on each shelf, this means there must be 2 books on the top shelf, 2 or 3 books on the middle shelf, and the remaining 3 or 4 books on the bottom shelf.\n4. K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M. Since more books are on the bottom than the top, F and M must be on the bottom shelf, and K must be on the middle or top shelf.\n5. O is on a higher shelf than L. So L must be on the middle or bottom shelf, and O must be on the middle or top shelf.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: H, I - This could be possible. K, L, and O could be on the bottom shelf.\nB: I, L - Not possible, as there must be at least 2 books on each shelf.\nC: H, I, L - This could be possible. K could be on the top shelf with G, and F, M, and O on the bottom.\nD: I, K, L - Not possible, as K cannot be on the same shelf as F, which is on the bottom.\nE: F, I, M - Not possible, as F and M must be on the bottom shelf together.\nTherefore, either A or C could be a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
