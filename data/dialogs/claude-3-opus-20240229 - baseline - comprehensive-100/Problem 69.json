Let's solve the second equation for $y$:\n   \n   $3x - 2y = -6$\n   $-2y = -3x - 6$\n   $y = \\frac{3x + 6}{2}$\n3) Now substitute this value of $y$ into the first equation:\n   \n   $2x - 3(\\frac{3x + 6}{2}) = -14$\n   $2x - \\frac{9x + 18}{2} = -14$\n   $4x - (9x + 18) = -28$\n   $4x - 9x - 18 = -28$\n   $-5x - 18 = -28$\n   $-5x = -10$\n   $x = 2$\n4) Now that we have $x$, we can find $y$ by substituting $x = 2$ into either of the original equations. Let's use the first one:\n   \n   $2(2) - 3y = -14$\n   $4 - 3y = -14$\n   $-3y = -18$\n   $y = 6$\n5) So the solution is $(x, y) = (2, 6)$. The question asks for the value of $x - y$:\n   \n   $x - y = 2 - 6 = -4$\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
