Physical changes alter the form of a substance without changing its chemical composition. Examples include grinding, mashing, and mixing.\n3. Chemical changes alter the chemical composition of a substance, forming new chemical compounds. Examples include the breakdown of nutrients by enzymes.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA. Adding acids to create a ball of food is a physical change as it alters the form without changing the chemical composition.\nB. Pepsin changing proteins to peptides is a chemical change as it breaks down proteins into smaller compounds (peptides).\nC. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices is a chemical change as it alters the chemical composition of the food.\nD. Squeezing food through the intestines is a physical change as it alters the form and location of the food without changing its chemical composition.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it is the only choice that describes a physical change.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
