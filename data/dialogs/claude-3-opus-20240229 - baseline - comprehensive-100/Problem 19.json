If we combine these statements, it could lead to the conclusion \"Friends are like dung\". However, we know this conclusion is absurd and not true.\n3. The question asks what can be logically derived from the fact that the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   - A: This could be true, but we can't definitively say the statement \"money is like dung\" is false just because the conclusion is absurd.\n   - B: This seems logical. If friends are indeed worth a lot of money (as per the second statement), and the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is false, then it implies that money is not like dung.\n   - C: While this may be a generally accepted truth, it doesn't directly follow from the given statements and the absurd conclusion.\n   - D: This is true in general (statements are either true or false), but it doesn't specifically address the logical problem at hand.\n5. Therefore, choice B seems to be the most logical derivation from the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
