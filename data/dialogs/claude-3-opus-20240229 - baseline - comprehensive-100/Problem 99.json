Chemical peeling is a technique used to improve the appearance of the skin by applying a chemical solution that causes the skin to exfoliate and eventually peel off.\n2. Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) commonly used in chemical peels. It helps to remove the outer layer of dead skin cells.\n3. Phenol is a strong chemical used for deep peels. It penetrates the skin deeply and is used to treat more severe skin issues.\n4. Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) used in chemical peels. It is oil-soluble and can penetrate into the pores, making it useful for treating acne.\n5. Kojic acid is a skin lightening agent derived from fungi. It is used to treat pigmentation issues like age spots and melasma. However, it is not typically used as a peeling agent.\nTherefore, among the given choices, kojic acid is not an agent used in chemical peeling.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
