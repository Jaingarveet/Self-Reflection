Find the speed of the space shuttle:\n   * In 40 seconds, it travels 700m high.\n   * Speed = Distance / Time\n   * Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s\n2. Now, we know that at this speed, it takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point.\n   * This means that in 5 seconds, the shuttle will travel a distance equal to its own length.\n3. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds:\n   * Distance = Speed × Time\n   * Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s = 87.5 m\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
