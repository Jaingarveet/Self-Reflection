This means that the coefficients of like terms on both sides must be equal.\n2) Expand the left side of the equation:\n   \n   $(ax+2)(bx+7) = abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14 = abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14$\n3) Equating the coefficients of $x^2$, $x$, and the constant terms on both sides:\n   \n   $ab = 15$\n   $7a + 2b = c$\n   $14 = 14$\n4) We're given that $a + b = 8$. Let's solve for $a$ and $b$.\n   \n   From $ab = 15$, we can write $b = 15/a$.\n   Substituting this in $a + b = 8$:\n   \n   $a + 15/a = 8$\n   \n   Multiplying by $a$:\n   \n   $a^2 + 15 = 8a$\n   $a^2 - 8a + 15 = 0$\n   \n   This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve it:\n   \n   $(a - 3)(a - 5) = 0$\n   \n   So, $a = 3$ or $a = 5$. Correspondingly, $b = 5$ or $b = 3$.\n5) Now, let's find the values of $c$. From $7a + 2b = c$:\n   \n   If $a = 3$ and $b = 5$, then $c = 7(3) + 2(5) = 21 + 10 = 31$.\n   If $a = 5$ and $b = 3$, then $c = 7(5) + 2(3) = 35 + 6 = 41$.\nTherefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
