Ovarian tumors that are more likely to undergo torsion are typically those that are larger, more mobile, and have a longer pedicle.\n3. Dermoid cysts (mature cystic teratomas) are benign tumors that often occur in younger women. They tend to be relatively large, mobile, and have a long pedicle, making them more prone to torsion compared to other ovarian tumors.\n4. Serous and mucinous cystadenomas are also benign ovarian tumors but are less likely to cause torsion compared to dermoid cysts.\n5. Theca lutein cysts are typically bilateral and occur as a result of ovarian hyperstimulation, often in the context of pregnancy. While they can be large, they are less mobile and less likely to cause torsion compared to dermoid cysts.\nTherefore, among the given choices, the ovarian tumor most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
