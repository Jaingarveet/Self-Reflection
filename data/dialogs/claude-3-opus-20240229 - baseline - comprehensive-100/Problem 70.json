This means:\n   \n   $X_{2015} = X_{2010} + 20\\% \\times X_{2010} = 120,000 + 0.2 \\times 120,000 = 144,000$\n4) Since $X_{2015} = Y_{2015}$, we know that $Y_{2015} = 144,000$ as well.\n5) Now, we're told that City Y's population decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. Let's use this to find $Y_{2010}$:\n   \n   $Y_{2015} = Y_{2010} - 10\\% \\times Y_{2010}$\n   \n   $144,000 = Y_{2010} - 0.1 \\times Y_{2010} = 0.9 \\times Y_{2010}$\n   \n   $Y_{2010} = 144,000 \\div 0.9 = 160,000$\nTherefore, the population of City Y in 2010 was 160,000.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
