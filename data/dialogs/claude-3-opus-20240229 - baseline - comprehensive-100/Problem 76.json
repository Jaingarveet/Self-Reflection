It is a non-living, physical component of the environment that provides energy for photosynthesis in plants.\n2. Grass: Grass is a living organism, specifically a producer that can convert sunlight into chemical energy through photosynthesis.\n3. Rabbit: A rabbit is a living organism, specifically a primary consumer that feeds on the grass.\n4. Snake: A snake is also a living organism, a secondary consumer that preys on the rabbit.\nAmong the given choices, sunlight is the only non-living (abiotic) factor in the food chain. The rest (grass, rabbit, and snake) are all living (biotic) components.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
