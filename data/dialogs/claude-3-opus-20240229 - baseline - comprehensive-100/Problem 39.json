In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The passage states that there are two kinds of horror stories: those about mad scientists and those about monstrous beasts.\n2. It also states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: \n   a) they describe violations of the laws of nature, and \n   b) they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\n3. Now, let's look at each answer choice:\n   A) This can't be inferred. The passage only states that some, not all, stories about monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n   B) This is too broad. The passage only states that horror stories that violate the laws of nature are intended to invoke dread, not any story that violates the laws of nature.\n   C) The passage only mentions that in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. It doesn't say this is usual for all horror stories.\n   D) The passage states that horror stories about mad scientists typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. This is different from expressing antiscientific views.\n   E) This follows logically. If both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature, and some horror stories about monstrous beasts employ symbolism, then some stories that employ symbolism must describe violations of the laws of nature.\nTherefore, choice E is the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
