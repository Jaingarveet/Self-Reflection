So, No.1 must be type A.\n2. Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls. This means it can recognize shape (ball) but not color (blue vs red). So, No.2 must be type B.\n3. We can eliminate choices A and B because we know that neither No.1 nor No.2 is type C (which can recognize neither color nor shape).\n4. Choice C correctly identifies the types of No.1 and No.2.\n5. Choice D is incorrect because we know No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
