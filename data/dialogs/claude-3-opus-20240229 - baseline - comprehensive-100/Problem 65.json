So, f(0) = 30.\n2) Each year after that, for the next 5 years, she doubled the number of people invited from the previous year.\n   So, in the second year (n = 1), she invited 30 * 2 = 60 people. f(1) = 60.\n   In the third year (n = 2), she invited 60 * 2 = 120 people. f(2) = 120.\n   In the fourth year (n = 3), she invited 120 * 2 = 240 people. f(3) = 240.\n   And so on.\n3) This doubling each year suggests an exponential function, not a linear function.\n4) The number of people invited is increasing each year, not decreasing.\nTherefore, the function f is an increasing exponential function.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
