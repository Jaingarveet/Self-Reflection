Levodopa: It is a precursor to dopamine and is converted to dopamine in the brain, increasing dopaminergic activity. It does not primarily affect cholinergic activity.\nB. Benserazide: It is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain. It does not directly affect cholinergic activity.\nC. Selegiline: It is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, thus increasing dopaminergic activity. It does not primarily target cholinergic activity.\nD. Biperiden: It is an anticholinergic drug that blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in the control of movement. By decreasing cholinergic activity in the brain, it helps to restore the balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in Parkinson's disease.\nTherefore, the anti-Parkinson drug that acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity is Biperiden.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
