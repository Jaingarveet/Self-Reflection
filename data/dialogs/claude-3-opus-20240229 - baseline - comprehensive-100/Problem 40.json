The argument states that Carl is an incompetent detective because he has solved a smaller percentage of cases (1 out of 25) than any other detective in the last 3 years.\n2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for Carl's low success rate, suggesting that it may not be due to his incompetence.\n3. Choice A states that the police chief assigns Carl the most difficult cases that others have failed to solve. This could explain why Carl has solved fewer cases, as he is given the toughest assignments. It weakens the argument by suggesting that Carl's low success rate may be due to the difficulty of his cases rather than his incompetence.\n4. Choices B, C, D, and E do not directly address why Carl has solved fewer cases compared to other detectives. They provide additional information about Carl's background or the police department, but they don't offer a compelling alternative explanation for his low success rate.\nTherefore, Choice A most seriously weakens the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
