If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA. If no Russian novels and exactly one play are selected, then all 5 or 6 selected works must be French (3 novels and 1 or 2 plays). This violates the requirement that no more than 4 French works can be selected.\nB. If exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected, the remaining 2 or 3 works must be French novels to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This is possible.\nC. If exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected, the remaining 2 or 3 works can be any combination of one Russian novel and one or two French novels. This is possible.\nD. If exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected, the plays could be both French, or one French and one Russian. The remaining 1 or 2 works could be Russian novels. This is possible.\nE. If exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected, the play could be French or Russian, and the remaining 2 or 3 works must include at least two French novels to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This is possible.\nTherefore, the only choice that could not be true is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
