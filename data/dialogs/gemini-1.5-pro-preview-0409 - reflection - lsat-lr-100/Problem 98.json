Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

While this assumption is flawed, it is not the main weakness of the argument. The core issue lies in the argument's presumption that actions not explicitly motivated by societal benefit cannot lead to such benefits.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on secondary issue\n*   Ignoring core assumption\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** Technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society.\n2.  **Identify the Premise:** Individuals responsible for technological advancements are motivated by personal gain, not societal benefit.\n3.  **Analyze the Gap:** The argument assumes that actions motivated by personal gain cannot result in societal benefits. This is a flawed assumption because actions can have unintended positive consequences.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Identify the conclusion and premises of the argument.**\n2.  **Analyze the logical connection between the premises and the conclusion.**\n3.  **Identify any assumptions made in the argument.**\n4.  **Evaluate the validity of the assumptions and their impact on the argument's strength.**\n5.  **Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples that weaken the argument.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Focus on the structure of the argument and the logical connections between premises and conclusions.**\n*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies, such as assuming the consequent or confusing correlation with causation.**\n*   **Consider the possibility of unintended consequences and indirect effects of actions.**\n*   **Don't get distracted by secondary issues or flawed assumptions that are not central to the argument's main weakness.** \n"
