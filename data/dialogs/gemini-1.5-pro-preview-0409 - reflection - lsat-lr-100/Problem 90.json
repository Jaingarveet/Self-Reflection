Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\n\nThought:\nThe journalist states that brown dwarfs have lithium and lack fully functional nuclear furnaces. This eliminates options A, C, and E. Option D is contradicted by the information about stars with incomplete mixing. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused on the presence of lithium as the defining characteristic and overlooked the distinction between stars and brown dwarfs based on the functionality of their nuclear furnaces. This led me to misinterpret the relationship between lithium presence and object type.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Overlooking key information\n*   Focusing on a single characteristic\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify key information:** Brown dwarfs have lithium and lack fully functional nuclear furnaces. Stars with less mass than the sun have no lithium due to complete mixing in their nuclear furnaces.\n2.  **Analyze options based on key information:**\n    *   Option A is incorrect because brown dwarfs also lack lithium.\n    *   Option B is incorrect because it refers to incomplete mixing, which is specific to certain stars, not all objects with lithium.\n    *   **Option C is correct** because brown dwarfs, by definition, have lithium and are not stars.\n    *   Option D is incorrect because some stars with lithium can have less mass than the sun.\n    *   Option E is incorrect because brown dwarfs themselves have less mass than some stars and possess lithium.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify and list all key characteristics** of each type of celestial object mentioned.\n2.  **Pay close attention to exclusions or exceptions** mentioned in the context.\n3.  **Analyze each answer choice** based on the established characteristics and exclusions.\n4.  **Eliminate options that contradict** the given information or introduce new information not supported by the context.\n5.  **Choose the option that aligns most accurately** with the provided information and logical deductions.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read the context carefully** and ensure complete understanding before analyzing answer choices.\n*   **Focus on the relationships** between different characteristics and object types.\n*   **Avoid making assumptions** or drawing conclusions beyond the scope of the provided information.\n*   **Consider all possibilities** before eliminating answer choices.\n*   **Double-check your reasoning** to ensure it aligns with the given context. \n"
