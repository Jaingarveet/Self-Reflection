Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.\n  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.\n  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.\n  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\n  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.\n\nThought:\nThe judge's reasoning hinges on the fact that ignorance of the difference between national and local codes is not a valid excuse for not complying with the national codes. \nThis aligns with the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the aspect of ignorance of the law rather than the specific relationship between national and local building codes. The judge's statement implies a hierarchy where compliance with national codes automatically ensures compliance with local codes.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of context\n*   Focus on irrelevant principle \n*   Ignoring hierarchical relationship between laws\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the Judge's Statement:** The judge emphasizes that the defendant's excuse might be valid for local code violations but not for national code violations.\n2.  **Identify the Underlying Principle:** This implies a relationship where adherence to national codes guarantees adherence to local codes, suggesting a hierarchical structure.\n3.  **Match with Answer Choices:** Option C, \"Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes,\" directly reflects this hierarchical relationship and justifies the judge's reasoning.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Carefully analyze the context and reasoning presented in the problem.**\n2.  **Identify the key legal principles or relationships involved.**\n3.  **Focus on the specific area of law and avoid applying general principles without careful consideration of the context.**\n4.  **Pay attention to any hierarchical relationships between different levels of law (e.g., national vs. local).**\n5.  **Eliminate answer choices that contradict the established context or legal principles.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Develop a strong understanding of the hierarchy of laws and how they interact.**\n*   **Practice applying legal principles to specific fact patterns.**\n*   **Improve reading comprehension skills to accurately grasp the nuances of legal reasoning.**\n*   **When unsure, eliminate obviously incorrect answers and focus on the remaining options.** \n"
