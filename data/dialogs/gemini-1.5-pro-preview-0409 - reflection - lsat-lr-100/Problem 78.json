        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\n\nThought:\nThe argument concludes that most employees will have a longer commute *after* the move. This implies they currently have a shorter commute. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the change in commute time rather than the reason why employees would choose a longer commute. The key was to identify the assumption that would force employees to accept the longer commute despite the affordability issue.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on the wrong aspect of the argument \n*   Ignoring the role of assumptions in logical reasoning\n## Solving the Problem\n1. **Identify the Conclusion:** Most Acme employees will have a longer commute after the move.\n2. **Identify the Evidence:** Most Acme employees cannot afford housing near Ocean View.\n3. **Identify the Gap:** What would make employees accept a longer commute despite the cost?\n4. **Analyze the answer choices:**\n    *   A and C are irrelevant to the affordability issue.\n    *   B focuses on the chairperson's motives, not the employees' situation.\n    *   D is the trap I fell into, focusing on the current commute time.\n    *   **E provides the missing link:** If there's no significant pay raise, employees might have to accept the longer commute due to financial constraints.\n## Instructions for Future Problems\n1. **Identify the conclusion and evidence in the argument.**\n2. **Pinpoint the gap between the evidence and conclusion.**\n3. **Analyze each answer choice to see which one bridges the gap and is essential for the argument to hold.**\n4. **Be wary of answer choices that seem related but focus on the wrong aspect or entity in the argument.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Pay close attention to the role of assumptions in logical reasoning.** \n*   **Consider all factors influencing the decision or outcome mentioned in the argument.**\n*   **Don't get sidetracked by information that is not directly relevant to the core of the argument.**\n*   **Practice identifying assumptions in various logical reasoning scenarios.** \n"
