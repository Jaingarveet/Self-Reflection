Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused on the relationship between winning films at Lac Nichoutec and international festivals, neglecting the possibility that some Lac Nichoutec winners might not have been shown internationally. The error stems from a misinterpretation of the \"most\" quantifier and a failure to consider all possible scenarios.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Quantifier misinterpretation (\"most\")\n*   Incomplete scenario analysis\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze the context:** Only Canadian films are shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n2.  **Interpret the first statement:** Most Lac Nichoutec winners also won at international festivals. This implies there could be some Lac Nichoutec winners that did NOT win at international festivals.\n3.  **Evaluate each option based on the context and statement:**\n    *   A and B are not necessarily true as the information only relates to winning films, not all films shown or produced.\n    *   C is likely true but not guaranteed. \n    *   **D is MUST be true** based on the interpretation in step 2.\n    *   E is not necessarily true as some international winners could have been shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**\n1.  **Carefully analyze the context and statements provided.**\n2.  **Pay close attention to quantifiers like \"most\" and \"some\" and understand their implications.**\n3.  **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that are not necessarily true.**\n4.  **Focus on identifying the option that MUST be true based on the given information.**\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Practice logical reasoning skills and strengthen your understanding of logical quantifiers.**\n*   **Approach problems systematically and avoid making assumptions.**\n*   **Consider different perspectives and possibilities before drawing conclusions.**\n*   **Review your reasoning process to identify and learn from any errors.** \n"
