Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\n\nThought:\nWe need to find an option that strengthens the argument that lawmakers consider the harm from theft equal to the harm from bribery because they instituted identical penalties.\n*   A: This supports the general idea of proportionality in sentencing but doesn't specifically address theft and bribery.\n*   B: This talks about making acts illegal, not the level of punishment, so it's not relevant.\n*   C: This discusses increasing penalties for specific instances, not the general equivalence of harm between two crimes.\n*   D: This directly supports the argument by stating that the harm caused by theft is similar to the harm caused by bribery.\n*   E: This talks about the effectiveness of deterrence, not the equivalence of harm between the two crimes. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused too narrowly on finding an option that directly compared the harm of theft and bribery, overlooking the broader context of proportionality in sentencing.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Narrow focus\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Overlooking context\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Understand the Argument:** The argument claims that identical penalties for theft and bribery suggest lawmakers view their harms as equal.\n2.  **Analyze Options:**\n    *   **A:** This option strengthens the argument by establishing a general principle of proportionality in sentencing, which supports the idea that equal penalties imply equal harm.\n    *   **B, C, D, E:** These options are irrelevant or don't directly support the argument's claim about the equivalence of harm based on equal penalties.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** Clearly understand the main point the argument is trying to make.\n2.  **Analyze the Reasoning:** Examine how the evidence supports the conclusion.\n3.  **Consider the Context:** Think about the broader principles or assumptions underlying the argument.\n4.  **Evaluate Options Holistically:** Look for options that strengthen the reasoning or provide additional support for the conclusion, considering the context.\n5.  **Avoid Narrow Focus:** Don't get fixated on finding options that directly mirror the conclusion; consider options that support the underlying logic.\n## General Advice\n*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the nuances of the argument and the answer choices.\n*   **Think Critically:** Analyze the reasoning and evidence, and consider alternative perspectives.\n*   **Consider the Bigger Picture:** Understand the context and underlying assumptions of the argument.\n*   **Practice:** Regularly engage with similar problems to improve your analytical skills. \n"
