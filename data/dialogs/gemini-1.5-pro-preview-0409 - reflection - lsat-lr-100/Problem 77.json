        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.\n  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\n\nThought:\nThe counselor argues that personal conflicts arise from irrationality, specifically the tendency to ascribe bad qualities more easily than good ones. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

I failed to grasp the broader context and the counselor's core argument.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on supporting detail\n*   Ignoring main conclusion\n*   Lack of contextual understanding\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Identify the topic:** The counselor discusses personal conflicts.\n2.  **Identify the counselor's position:** They argue against the assumption that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n3.  **Analyze the reasoning:** The counselor claims irrationality leads to conflicts, but the main point is that conflicts are not unavoidable.\n4.  **Evaluate answer choices:** \n    *   A and E are premises, not conclusions.\n    *   B and C are examples of irrationality, not the main conclusion.\n    *   **D directly reflects the counselor's argument against the inevitability of conflicts.**\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Identify the main topic and scope of the argument.**\n2.  **Distinguish between premises, supporting examples, and the main conclusion.**\n3.  **Focus on the overall claim rather than specific details.**\n4.  **Ensure the chosen answer directly addresses the main point of the argument.**\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Read the entire passage carefully before analyzing answer choices.**\n*   **Pay attention to transition words and phrases that indicate conclusions (e.g., therefore, thus, hence).**\n*   **Consider the author's purpose and intended audience.**\n*   **Practice identifying conclusions in various argumentative texts.** \n"
