Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\n\nThought:\nWe need to find the option that directly counters Tamara's claim about squeaky floors being a defense against ninjas. \nOption B directly addresses this by stating that ninjas could walk silently on squeaky floors, thus negating the purpose of such floors as a warning system.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was too narrow, focusing only on the ninja's ability to circumvent squeaky floors. I failed to consider the broader context and the implication of Tamara's statement regarding the prevalence of ninja threats.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Narrow focus\n*   Ignoring context\n*   Missing implication \n*   Assumption error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze Tamara's Claim:** Tamara implies that ninja threats were common enough to warrant widespread architectural countermeasures (squeaky floors) among wealthy Japanese.\n2.  **Identify Counter-Argument Strategy:** To counter this, Patricia needs to undermine the assumption of widespread ninja threats.\n3.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Option C** directly addresses this by stating that the wealthy were a small portion of the population. This implies that even if all wealthy people had squeaky floors, it wouldn't represent a significant portion of the population, thus weakening the claim of widespread fear of ninjas. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion and Assumptions:** Clearly understand the main point and the underlying assumptions of the argument.\n2.  **Consider the Broader Context:** Don't focus solely on specific details; analyze the bigger picture and implications.\n3.  **Evaluate Counter-Arguments Holistically:** Assess how each option impacts the overall argument and its assumptions.\n4.  **Choose the Strongest Counter:** Select the option that most effectively weakens the opposing argument's foundation.\n## General Advice\n*   **Think Critically:** Don't accept statements at face value; analyze their underlying logic and implications.\n*   **Consider Multiple Perspectives:** Explore different viewpoints and potential counter-arguments.\n*   **Avoid Assumptions:** Don't make assumptions based on limited information or personal biases.\n*   **Focus on the Big Picture:** Understand the context and overall structure of the argument. \n"
