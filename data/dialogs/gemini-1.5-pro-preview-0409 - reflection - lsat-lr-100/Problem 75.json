Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?\nChoices:\n  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.\n  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.\n  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.\n  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\n  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.\n\nThought:\nThe Figorian Development Commission argues for the right to develop their resources similarly to other nations. \nOption D aligns with this by stating that regulations shouldn't penalize nations based on past environmental actions.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the aspect of fairness between nations in resource usage, neglecting the core argument about the impact of development on wildlife. Option D, while seemingly relevant to fairness, doesn't directly address the central issue of whether development should be allowed based on its potential harm to endangered species.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on irrelevant detail\n*   Neglecting the central issue \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify the core argument:** The central disagreement is whether wetland development should be allowed despite potential harm to endangered species.\n2.  **Analyze each option's relevance to the core argument:**\n    *   Options A, B, and E are irrelevant as they don't address the conditions for allowing development.\n    *   Option D focuses on fairness between nations but doesn't address the impact on wildlife.\n    *   **Option C directly addresses the condition for regulation, stating it should only occur when harm to endangered species is proven.**\n3.  **Choose the option that aligns with the Development Commission's position:** Option C supports their stance by suggesting development should be allowed until harm is demonstrated.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the core argument or disagreement in the text.**\n2.  **Focus on the specific issue at hand, ignoring irrelevant details or broader philosophical stances.**\n3.  **Analyze each option based on its direct relevance to the core argument, not its general appeal or alignment with a particular viewpoint.**\n4.  **Choose the option that directly addresses the central issue and supports the position in question.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Read the text carefully and identify the main point of contention.**\n*   **Pay close attention to the specific conditions or criteria mentioned in the arguments.**\n*   **Avoid getting distracted by peripheral issues or general principles that don't directly address the central question.**\n*   **Focus on the logical connection between the options and the core argument.** \n"
