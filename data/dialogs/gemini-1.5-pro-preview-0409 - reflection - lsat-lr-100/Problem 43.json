        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love \"until death do us part.\" If \"love\" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\n\nThought:\nThe ethicist's argument hinges on the idea that promising something outside of one's control is nonsensical. So, the assumption is that people shouldn't make such promises. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused on the ethicist's reasoning about control over feelings but missed the key point about interpreting promises in a way that makes sense. The core assumption is about interpreting the meaning of the vow, not the nature of promises or feelings.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on irrelevant detail \n*   Ignoring key assumption\n## Solving the Problem\n1.  **Analyze the Conclusion:** The ethicist concludes that \"love\" in marital vows should not be interpreted as referring to feelings.\n2.  **Identify the Reasoning:** This conclusion is based on the premise that promises to do something uncontrollable (like controlling feelings) are nonsensical.\n3.  **Find the Assumption:** The assumption must bridge the gap between the premise and conclusion. It is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion and Premise:** Clearly understand the main points of the argument.\n2.  **Focus on the Gap:** Determine what unstated assumption connects the premise to the conclusion.\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** Choose the option that best represents the missing assumption needed for the argument to be valid.\n4.  **Consider Alternative Interpretations:** Explore different ways the conclusion could be reached and the assumptions underlying each path.\n## General Advice\n*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the details of the argument and avoid jumping to conclusions.\n*   **Identify Assumptions:** Be aware of unstated assumptions that arguments rely on.\n*   **Consider Context:** Think about the broader context of the argument and the author's perspective.\n*   **Practice Critical Thinking:** Regularly engage in exercises that challenge your reasoning and logic skills. \n"
