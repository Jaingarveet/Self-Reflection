Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.\n  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.\n  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.\n  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.\n  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.\n\nThought:\nWe need to find an option that weakens the claim that stretching doesn't prevent injuries.\nOption C suggests that most jogging injuries are unrelated to flexibility, which would explain why stretching doesn't seem to have an effect. \nThis weakens the researcher's argument.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused on finding an answer choice that explained why stretching might not have a preventative effect, rather than directly weakening the researcher's conclusion. This led me to misinterpret the goal of the question.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpreting question objective\n*   Focusing on explanation rather than weakening the argument\n*   Misunderstanding logical reasoning structure\n## Solving the Problem\n1. **Identify the Conclusion:** The researcher concludes that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries.\n2. **Analyze Answer Choices:** We need to find an option that suggests stretching *might* help prevent injuries, thus weakening the researcher's conclusion.\n3. **Evaluate Option D:** This option states that injury-prone joggers are more likely to stretch beforehand. This implies that the group of stretching joggers might have been more susceptible to injuries in the first place, making the comparison between the groups less reliable and potentially explaining why they still had a similar number of injuries despite stretching. \nTherefore, **Option D weakens the researcher's argument** by suggesting an alternative explanation for the similar injury rates. \n## Instructions for Future Problems\n1. **Identify the Conclusion:** Clearly understand the main point the argument is trying to make.\n2. **Focus on Weakening/Strengthening:** Determine whether you need to find an option that weakens or strengthens the conclusion.\n3. **Analyze Answer Choices:** Look for options that directly contradict or support the conclusion, not just explain it.\n4. **Consider Alternative Explanations:**  Think about options that offer different reasons for the observed outcome.\n5. **Choose the Most Direct Weakening/Strengthening Option:** Select the answer that most effectively undermines or supports the conclusion.\n## General Advice\n*   **Practice Logical Reasoning:** Familiarize yourself with common logical fallacies and argument structures.\n*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the question and answer choices.\n*   **Think Critically:** Don't just accept the conclusion at face value; consider alternative explanations and perspectives.\n*   **Review Mistakes:** Learn from incorrect answers and understand why they were wrong. \n"
