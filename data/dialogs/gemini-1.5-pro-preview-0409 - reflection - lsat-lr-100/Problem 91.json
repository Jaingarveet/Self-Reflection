Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nThought:\nThe context highlights the variability of allergens in cats and the individual responses of allergy sufferers. \nOption B directly addresses this by stating that no single cat can trigger allergies in all individuals. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My focus on the variability of allergic reactions led me to overlook the more direct statement about the cause – the differing proteins in cats. Option B, while related, is more of an implication of the varying proteins rather than a direct statement about them.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Focus on implication over direct cause\n*   Overlooking key information\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify the central theme:** The passage focuses on the variability of allergens (proteins) in cats and the resulting individual allergic responses.\n2.  **Analyze each option:**\n    *   A: This is not supported as the passage doesn't discuss breed-specific allergens.\n    *   B: This is an implication of the varying proteins but not a direct statement about them.\n    *   **C: This directly addresses the core point – cats differ in their protein composition.**\n    *   D: The passage doesn't compare the intensity of allergic reactions.\n    *   E: While predictability is complex, the passage doesn't explicitly make this claim.\n3.  **Choose the best option:** Option C aligns most directly with the passage's main point about the variability of proteins in cats. \n## Future Instructions\n1.  **Identify the main point of the passage.**\n2.  **Focus on direct statements and causes rather than implications or correlations.**\n3.  **Analyze each option in relation to the passage's central theme.**\n4.  **Eliminate options that are not directly supported or are irrelevant.**\n5.  **Choose the option that best reflects the passage's main point.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Read the passage carefully and identify the key points and supporting details.**\n*   **Pay attention to the specific wording of the question and options.**\n*   **Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not directly supported by the passage.**\n*   **Consider all options before making a final decision.**\n*   **Practice actively analyzing passages and answering questions to improve comprehension and critical thinking skills.** \n"
