Let's analyze the options:\n* **A:** This assumes all prize-winning Canadian films internationally were at Lac Nichoutec, which is not stated.\n* **B:** This assumes Lac Nichoutec showcases most Canadian films produced, which is not stated.\n* **C:** This directly follows from the given information. If Lac Nichoutec winners also won internationally, then some international winners must be Canadian.\n* **D:** This is possible but not guaranteed. We only know about \"most\" winners, not all.\n* **E:** This is also possible but not guaranteed. The information focuses on Lac Nichoutec winners, not all international winners.\nTherefore, the only statement that **must be true** is that some internationally awarded films were Canadian, as they were also winners at Lac Nichoutec.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
