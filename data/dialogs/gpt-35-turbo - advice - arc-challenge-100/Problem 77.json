        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always consider all the information provided in the question.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that assumptions and logical errors can lead to incorrect answers.\n"

However, in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. This suggests that the sheep with light wool have some advantage over the sheep with dark wool, which may help them survive and breed better. If a new sheep predator is introduced to the island, the sheep with light wool may have an advantage over the sheep with dark wool, as they may be better able to hide from the predator due to their lighter color. Therefore, an increase in the population of sheep with light wool is the most likely change to occur first.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
