Which of the following has the lowest mass?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 m^3 of bricks\n  B: 4 m^3 of bricks\n  C: 6000 m^3 of air\n  D: 10,000 m^3 of air\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly calculated the mass of each option. \nI made a calculation error in option D.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Multiplication error\n - Unit error\nSolution:\nTo find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option.\nMass = Density x Volume\nOption A: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3 = 4000 kg\nOption B: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3 = 8000 kg\nOption C: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg\nOption D: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 10000 m^3 = 10000 kg\nThe option with the lowest mass is option A, with a mass of 4000 kg.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the density of each material.\n2. Identify the volume of each option.\n3. Calculate the mass of each option using the formula Mass = Density x Volume.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the option with the lowest mass.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to use the correct units in your calculations.\n"
