Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Review each option and eliminate any that are clearly incorrect.\n3. Research or recall relevant knowledge about the topic.\n4. Evaluate each option based on the available information.\n5. Choose the option that is most accurate or best supported by the evidence.\n6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always review all options before making a choice.\n - Always use relevant knowledge to evaluate each option.\n - Never make assumptions or guesses without evidence.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the most accurate option is the one that is best supported by the evidence.\n"
