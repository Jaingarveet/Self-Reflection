Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.\n3. Identify the correct first step in the process.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your knowledge of the correct order of the steps.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always recall the relevant information from memory.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the order of steps in a process is important.\n"
