To find the number of matches the team lost, I need to multiply the percentage of matches lost by the number of matches won.\n\n1. The team won 20 matches.\n2. The team lost 30% of their matches, which means they lost 30% of 20 matches.\n3. To find the number of matches the team lost, I multiply 30% of 20 matches, which is 6 matches (30% x 20 = 6).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 30 matches."
