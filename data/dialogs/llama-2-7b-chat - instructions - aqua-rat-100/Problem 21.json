I misunderstood the ratio of the number of men and the number of hours they work, which led to an incorrect answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the formula:\nWork done = Number of men x Number of hours worked\n\nIn the original problem, x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.\nTo find the work that y men working y hours per day can do in y days, we can use the same formula:\nWork done = Number of men x Number of hours worked\n\nSo, if x men can do x units of work in x days, then y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) x3/y2 units.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
