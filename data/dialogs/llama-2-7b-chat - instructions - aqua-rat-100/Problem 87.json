(n factorial).\n\nCalculation:\nThe number of oranges in the basket is 10. To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges, we use the permutation formula:\n\n10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × ... × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800\n\nSo, there are 3,628,800 ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
