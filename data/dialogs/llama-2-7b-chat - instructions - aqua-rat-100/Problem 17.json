To find the minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total production cost for the year first.\n\nTotal production cost = 420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800 per month\nTotal production cost for the year = $46,800 per month x 12 months = $561,600\n\nNow, we need to calculate the minimum selling price that will result in a profit of at least $626,400. Let's assume that the company sells all the components at the minimum selling price, which is $240 per unit.\n\nTotal revenue = 420 units x $240 per unit = $98,800 per month\nTotal revenue for the year = $98,800 per month x 12 months = $1,185,600\n\nProfit = Total revenue - Total production cost = $1,185,600 - $561,600 = $624,000\n\nTherefore, the minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400 is $240 per unit.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
