What will be the measure of each side?\n\nSelf-Reflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. The problem requires me to calculate the perimeter of the original rectangle and then determine the length of each side of the square. I will follow the correct steps to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nStep 1: Identify the problem and understand the given information.\nThe problem is to find the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending a wire in the shape of a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm.\n\nStep 2: Determine the perimeter of the original rectangle.\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter of the original rectangle is:\nPerimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(27 + 17) = 64 cm\n\nStep 3: Calculate the length of each side of the square.\nSince the wire is being rebent to form a square, the length of each side of the square is half the length of the original rectangle. Therefore, the length of each side of the square is:\nLength of each side = Perimeter / 4 = 64 cm / 4 = 16 cm\n\nStep 4: Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nI have calculated the length of each side of the square to be 16 cm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 11 cm.\n\nI hope this self-reflection helps me arrive at the correct answer this time."
