Science books\n\nUsing the formula for combinatorial counting, we can calculate the number of ways to arrange the books as follows:\n\nTotal number of ways to arrange the books = Number of ways to arrange the English books x Number of ways to arrange the Hindi books x Number of ways to arrange the Mathematics books x Number of ways to arrange the History books x Number of ways to arrange the Geography books x Number of ways to arrange the Science books\n= 5 x 3 x 4 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 1 = 720\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 720.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
