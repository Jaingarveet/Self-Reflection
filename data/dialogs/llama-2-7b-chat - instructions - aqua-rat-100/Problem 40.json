I misunderstood the problem and gave the wrong answer.\n\nAction: I will now use my self-reflection to answer the question correctly.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is (C) 28.\n\nExplanation: John had Rs.75, and if he gives half of it to Mark, John will have Rs.75/2 = Rs.37.50. If John gives one-third of his money to Mark, John will have Rs.75/3 = Rs.25. So, John had Rs.37.50 + Rs.25 = Rs.62.50."
