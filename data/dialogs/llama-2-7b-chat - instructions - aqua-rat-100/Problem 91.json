I mistakenly added the distances traveled in all directions instead of adding them separately.\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, we need to follow the steps:\n\n1. Identify the direction of travel: south (3 km), east (5 km), north (3 km), and west (2 km)\n2. Calculate the distance traveled in each direction:\n3 km (south), 5 km (east), 3 km (north), and 2 km (west)\n3. Add up the distances traveled in all directions: 3 km + 5 km + 3 km + 2 km = 13 km\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2 km.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
