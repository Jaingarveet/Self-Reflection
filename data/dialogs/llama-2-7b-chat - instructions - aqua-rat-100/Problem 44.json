Read the problem carefully and understand what is being asked: The problem states that 8 men work for 6 days to complete a work. To find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to divide the number of days by 2.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps: We need to find out how many men are required to complete the work in 1 day, and then divide that number by 2 to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.\n3. Use the correct mathematical formula to solve the problem: To find out how many men are required to complete the work in 1 day, we can multiply the number of men by the number of days: 8 men x 6 days = 48 men.\n4. Double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy: To find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to divide 48 men by 2: 48 men รท 2 = 24 men.\n5. Choose the answer that matches our calculated result: The correct answer is A: 93 men.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 93 men."
