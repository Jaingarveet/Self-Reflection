To find the number of white and brown sharpeners Jack bought, I need to use the information that he paid Rs. 100 for 18 sharpeners.\nAction: Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. Jack paid Rs. 100 for 18 sharpeners.\n2. Since he paid 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is Rs. 100 + 1 = Rs. 101.\n3. The cost of each brown sharpeners is Rs. 100.\n4. Since Jack bought 18 sharpeners, the number of white sharpeners he bought is:\n18 x (101/100) = 9 white sharpeners\nThe number of brown sharpeners he bought is:\n18 x (100/100) = 9 brown sharpeners\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
