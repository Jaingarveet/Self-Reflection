How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that I made a mistake in my calculation. To solve this problem correctly, I will follow the steps below:\n\n1. Identify the distance and speed given in the problem:\nDistance = 48 miles\nSpeed = 12 miles/hour\n2. Divide the distance by the speed to find the time:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours\n3. Work step-by-step through my mathematical calculations:\n48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours\n4 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 240 minutes.\n\nI apologize for my previous mistake and hope this answer is correct."
