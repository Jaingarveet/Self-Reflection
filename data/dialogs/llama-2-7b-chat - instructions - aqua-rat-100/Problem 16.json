The correct conversion ratio is 1/4 inch = 10 miles, not 1 inch = 10 miles.\n\nTo calculate the actual distance from Town F to Town G, we can use the map distance of 20 inches and the conversion ratio of 1/4 inch = 10 miles:\n\n20 inches = 20 x 1/4 miles = 50 miles\n\nTherefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G is 50 miles.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) 1140 miles."
