The correct solution involves using the formula:\ndistance = speed x time\n\nFor the first car, the distance traveled is 50 miles x 12 mph = 600 miles.\nFor the second car, the distance traveled is 50 miles x 13 mph = 650 miles.\n\nTo find when they will meet, we need to find the time it takes for the first car to travel 600 miles and the second car to travel 650 miles.\n\nTime = distance / speed\n\nFor the first car, time = 600 miles / 12 mph = 50 hours.\nFor the second car, time = 650 miles / 13 mph = 50.77 hours.\n\nSince they start at the same time, they will meet after 50 hours.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
