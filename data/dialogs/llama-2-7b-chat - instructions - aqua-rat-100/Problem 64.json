I am now 60 years old, and when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age, which means he was 1 year old. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 69 years old.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Identify the age of the person when their brother was half their age: 2 years old\n2. Calculate the number of years that have passed since the person was 2 years old: 60 - 2 = 58 years have passed\n3. Subtract the number of years that have passed from the current age of the person to find the age of the brother: 60 - 58 = 2 years old\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 69 years old."
