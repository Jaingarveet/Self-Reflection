This means that the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 is:\n\nDistance = Cost / Price per quarter-mile\nDistance = $8.50 / $3.50\nDistance = 2.5 quarter-miles\n\nSince the first quarter-mile cost $3.50, the additional 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile will be:\n\nAdditional distance = 2.5 quarter-miles x $0.10 per quarter-mile\nAdditional distance = $0.25\n\nTotal distance traveled = Initial distance + Additional distance\nTotal distance = 2.5 quarter-miles + $0.25\nTotal distance = 2.75 quarter-miles\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile is:\n\nMaximum distance = 2.75 quarter-miles\nMaximum distance = 11.75 miles\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
