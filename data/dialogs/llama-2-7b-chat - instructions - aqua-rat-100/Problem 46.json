Total monthly income of the man: I calculated the total monthly income of the man as Rs. 4270 (B).\n2. Monthly savings of the man: I calculated the monthly savings of the man as 12.5% of his income, which is Rs. 512.50 (C).\n3. Formula to find the monthly income: The formula to find the monthly income is: Monthly Income = Total Income / (1 - Savings Percentage).\n\nUsing the formula, I calculated the monthly income as follows:\n\nMonthly Income = Rs. 4270 / (1 - 0.125) = Rs. 4270 / 0.875 = Rs. 4900\n\nSo, the monthly income of the man is Rs. 4900 (D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Rs. 4900.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer."
