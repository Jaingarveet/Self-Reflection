        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\n\nThought:\nThe introduction of a new predator to the island will likely affect the sheep population based on their physical traits, such as size and color. Since the dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, they may be more noticeable to predators, making them more vulnerable to predation. On the other hand, the light wool sheep may be less visible to predators, giving them an advantage in avoiding predation.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

Identify the new factor introduced to the environment (i.e., the predator).\n2. Consider how this factor may affect the sheep population based on their physical traits.\n3.
