Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim\n  B: Mahr\n  C: Stuckey\n  D: Tiao\n  E: Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nEither Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1.\nEither [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2.\nParra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same sales zone as each other.\nThere are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.\nParra cannot work in Zone 1 if [REDACTED] works in Zone 1.\nTherefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.\n[REDACTED] or [REDACTED] works in Zone 2.\nQuinn cannot work in Zone 2.\nThe only option that satisfies this condition is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"

        "content": "  Answer: E\n\nExplanation:\nQuinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, as Tiao works in Zone 1, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I did not consider the fact that Quinn and Parra work in the same sales zone as each other. This means that if Parra works in Zone 1, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, the only option that satisfies this condition is E: Udall.\n\nNote: The redacted information in the reflection refers to the fact that the question stated that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both. However, since Quinn cannot work in Zone 2, it means that Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, the redacted information is not relevant to the correct answer."
