        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target\n  B: Solide's website target\n  C: Solide's voicemail target\n  D: Truvest's website target\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nI should have carefully read and understood the condition before answering the question. I should have realized that the condition applies to all clients, not just the client with the shortest voicemail target.\n"
