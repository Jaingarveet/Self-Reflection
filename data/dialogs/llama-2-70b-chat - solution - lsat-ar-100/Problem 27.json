The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include both Kramer and O'Neill.\n\nWe also know that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. However, we also know that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so if Lopez does not review Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include Kramer, O'Neill, and either Lopez or Megregian.\n\nThe only choice that satisfies these conditions is B: Kramer, O'Neill.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.\n\nUpon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that Lopez must review Tamerlane if Jiang does not review it. However, we only know that Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews, not that Lopez must review every play that Jiang does not review.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed B: Kramer, O'Neill, as they are the only two students who we know for certain review Tamerlane."
