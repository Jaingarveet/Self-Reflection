Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Assign parking space #1 to Young.\n2. Assign parking space #2 to Togowa.\n3. Assign parking space #3 to Robertson.\n4. Assign parking space #4 to Souza.\n5. Assign parking space #5 to Vaughn.\n6. Assign parking space #6 to Xu.\n"

Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. Young must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\n2. Togowa must be assigned parking space #2 or #4.\n3. Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n4. Souza must be assigned parking space #4 or #5.\n5. Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\nThis is compatible with the rules, but it doesn't necessarily follow from Robertson being assigned parking space #3.\n\nB: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\nThis is compatible with the rules, but it doesn't necessarily follow from Robertson being assigned parking space #3.\n\nC: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\nThis is compatible with the rules, but it doesn't necessarily follow from Robertson being assigned parking space #3.\n\nD: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\nThis is incompatible with the rules, as Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n\nE: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nThis is incompatible with the rules, as Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
