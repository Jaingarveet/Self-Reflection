Specifically, I missed the fact that L must be shown after K and before M.\n\nWith that in mind, let's re-evaluate the choices:\n\nA: K is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis is incorrect because K cannot be shown in the morning, and J is shown in the evening. Therefore, it is not possible for K to be shown after J.\n\nB: L is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as above. L must be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, L cannot be shown after J.\n\nC: P is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis is possible. P could be shown in the evening, after J is shown.\n\nD: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown.\nThis is incorrect. N and O could be shown in the afternoon, but they cannot both be shown after M is shown.\n\nE: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.\nThis is possible. N and P could be shown in the afternoon, after K is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
