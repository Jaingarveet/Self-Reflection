Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

Here's my revised solution:\n\nFrom the given conditions, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nIf George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then we can deduce the following possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nScenario 2: George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.\nScenario 3: George gives a report on Tuesday, Robert gives a report on Monday, and Nina gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's analyze each scenario and see which one could be true:\n\nScenario 1: In this scenario, Nina gives a report on Monday, which means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. However, this contradicts the fact that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Scenario 1 is not possible.\n\nScenario 2: In this scenario, Robert gives a report on Monday, which means that Olivia cannot give a report on Monday. However, we know that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this scenario is also not possible.\n\nScenario 3: In this scenario, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, which means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Thursday. Since Thursday is not one of the three consecutive days (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday), this scenario is also not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible scenario is that George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
