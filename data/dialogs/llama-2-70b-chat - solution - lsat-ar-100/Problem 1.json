Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nRe-read the question and identify the key conditions:\n\n1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nNow, let's consider all possible schedules that meet the conditions:\n\nSchedule 1:\n\n* Monday: Franco, Garcia\n* Tuesday: Hong, Iturbe\n* Wednesday: Jackson\n\nThis schedule violates condition 1, as Franco and Garcia testify on the same day.\n\nSchedule 2:\n\n* Monday: Franco, Hong\n* Tuesday: Garcia, Iturbe\n* Wednesday: Jackson\n\nThis schedule violates condition 4, as Hong testifies on Monday.\n\nSchedule 3:\n\n* Monday: Garcia, Hong\n* Tuesday: Franco, Iturbe\n* Wednesday: Jackson\n\nThis schedule violates condition 3, as only one witness (Franco) testifies on Tuesday.\n\nSchedule 4:\n\n* Monday: Garcia, Iturbe\n* Tuesday: Franco, Hong\n* Wednesday: Jackson\n\nThis schedule satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as the schedule cannot have Jackson testifying on Tuesday and two witnesses testifying on Monday.\n"
