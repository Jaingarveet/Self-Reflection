At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe are given that:\n\n* More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf\n* I is on the middle shelf\n* K is on a higher shelf than F\n* O is on a higher shelf than L\n* F is on the same shelf as M\n\nWe can start by placing I on the middle shelf.\nWe know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K goes on the top shelf and F goes on the middle shelf.\nWe know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O goes on the top shelf and L goes on the bottom shelf.\nWe know that F is on the same shelf as M, so F and M go on the middle shelf together.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining books:\n\n* H goes on the bottom shelf with L.\n* G goes on the top shelf with K.\n\nNow, all the books are placed on the shelves:\n\nTop shelf: K, G\nMiddle shelf: I, F, M\nBottom shelf: L, H, O\n"

        "content": "  Answer: The correct answer is option B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nExplanation:\nWe know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K goes on the top shelf and F goes on the middle shelf. We also know that G is on the top shelf with K. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous answer, I incorrectly selected option A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. I realized that I misunderstood the given information and placed I and M on the same shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n\nAfter re-reading the problem statement and the given conditions, I realized that I should have placed I on the middle shelf and F on the middle shelf with M, as F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other."
