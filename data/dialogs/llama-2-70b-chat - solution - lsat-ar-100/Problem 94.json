Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe are given that the veterinarian is in space 5.\nWe can start by placing the pharmacy in space 7, as it must be at one end of the row.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we can place one restaurant in space 1 and the other in space 4.\nThe pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so we can place the optometrist in space 6.\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can place it in space 3.\nThe shoe store can be placed in space 2.\n"
