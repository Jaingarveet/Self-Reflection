I incorrectly inferred that option [REDACTED] was not a logical inference, while the correct answer was option [REDACTED]. My error was in the interpretation of the statement and the logical reasoning process.\nError Keywords:\n- Interpretation error\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Inference error\nSolution:\nThe statement by Confucius is a version of the Golden Rule, suggesting that one should not treat others in ways that one would not want to be treated. This does not imply that if you want something, then you should give it to others, as suggested in option [REDACTED]. The other options can be inferred from the statement to some extent.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the given statement thoroughly.\n2. Analyze each option and determine if it can be logically inferred from the statement.\n3. Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the statement.\n4. Choose the option that cannot be logically inferred from the statement.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and the options carefully.\n- Understand the context of the statement before making inferences.\n- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the statement.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n"
