I thought the question was asking for a solution to reduce traffic accidents, not an explanation for the inconsistency between strict drunk driving investigations and similar accident rates.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Reading comprehension\n- Logical reasoning\nSolution:\nThe question is asking for a statement that can reconcile the inconsistency between the strict investigation of drunk driving and the similar rates of traffic accidents in cities that do and do not strictly investigate drunk driving. \nOption [REDACTED]: \"[REDACTED]\" This statement suggests that despite the strict investigations, drunk driving still occurs, leading to similar accident rates. This explains the inconsistency.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to understand what it's asking.\n2. Identify the inconsistency or contradiction in the given information.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the inconsistency.\n4. Choose the answer that best explains or resolves the inconsistency.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking.\n- Pay attention to the specific wording of the question and answer choices.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n- Don't rush. Take your time to understand the question and evaluate each answer choice.\n"
