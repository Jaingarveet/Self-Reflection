F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following pairs of employees is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department?\nChoices:\n  A: G and I\n  B: G and X\n  C: G and Y\n  D: H and W\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the third condition, which states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. This means that if [REDACTED] are both in the sales department, W would have to be in the production department, which would leave no room for F, who must be in the production department. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot both be in the sales department.\nError Keywords:\n- Overlooking conditions\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logic error\nSolution:\n1. Identify the conditions for each candidate's allocation.\n2. F must be in the production department, so G cannot be in the production department.\n3. If X is in the sales department, W must be in the production department.\n4. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot both be in the sales department because it would leave no room for F in the production department.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and conditions carefully.\n2. Identify the conditions for each candidate's allocation.\n3. Consider the implications of each condition.\n4. Identify any conflicts between the conditions.\n5. Use the conditions to eliminate impossible combinations.\n6. Choose the answer that is not possible based on the conditions.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and conditions carefully.\n- Understand the implications of each condition.\n- Consider the relationships between the conditions.\n- Use the conditions to eliminate impossible combinations.\n- Double-check your answer to ensure it meets all conditions.\n"
