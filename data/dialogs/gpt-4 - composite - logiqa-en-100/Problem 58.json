        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?\nChoices:\n  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.\n  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.\n  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.\n  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? \"The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand.\"\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the relationship between the percentage increase in housing prices and land prices. I assumed that any increase in land prices, no matter how small, would support the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. However, in choice [REDACTED], the increase in residential prices is significantly larger than the increase in land prices, which casts doubt on the assertion.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Percentage comparison\n- Cause and effect relationship\nSolution:\nThe assertion is that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. \nIn choice [REDACTED], residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, but residential land prices only rose by 0.37%. This small increase in land prices compared to the larger increase in housing prices casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the assertion or claim made in the question.\n2. Analyze each choice and determine whether it supports or contradicts the assertion.\n3. Pay attention to the percentage increase in both housing prices and land prices.\n4. If the increase in housing prices is significantly larger than the increase in land prices, this casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.\n5. Choose the answer that most contradicts the assertion.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and choices carefully.\n- Understand the assertion or claim made in the question.\n- Analyze the relationship between different variables in the choices.\n- Pay attention to the percentage comparison between different variables.\n- Understand the cause and effect relationship.\n"
