If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 30\n  C: 45\n  D: 60\n  E: 75\n\nThought: \nLet's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. Then, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. \nThe total cost for the newspapers is $210. We know that the cost for the Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x and the cost for the newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is 6x * $1 = $6x. \nSo, we can set up the equation: $8x (for Sunday) + $6x (for Monday to Saturday) = $210. \nSolving this equation will give us the value of x, which is the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday.\nAction: \nFirst, combine like terms: 8x + 6x = 14x.\nThen, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x: 210 / 14 = 15.\nAnswer: \"A\"\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
