If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.\nChoices:\n  A: 1584\n  B: 2520\n  C: 1728\n  D: 1656\n  E: None\n\nThought:\nLet's denote the number as x. The student should have found 7/8*x but instead found 7/18*x. The difference between these two values is 770. So, we can write the equation as follows:\n7/8*x - 7/18*x = 770\nTo solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72. So, we rewrite the equation as:\n63/72*x - 28/72*x = 770\nCombine the fractions:\n35/72*x = 770\nTo solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:\nx = 770 * 72/35\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
