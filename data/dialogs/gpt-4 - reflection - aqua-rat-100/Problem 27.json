Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I subtracted the initial contribution from the new contribution, which is not what the question asked for. The question asked for the new contribution amount, not the difference.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of the question\n- Calculation error\n- Subtraction error\nSolution:\nThe total cost of the gift is Rs. D. Initially, this cost is shared among M men, so each man contributes D/M. If 3 men drop out, the cost is now shared among M-3 men, so each man contributes D/(M-3). Therefore, the correct answer is D/(M-3), which is option D.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question and what is being asked.\n2. Identify the total cost of the gift and the initial number of men.\n3. Calculate the initial contribution per man by dividing the total cost by the number of men.\n4. Calculate the new contribution per man after 3 men drop out by dividing the total cost by the new number of men (M-3).\n5. The new contribution per man is the answer.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler steps.\n- Be careful with calculations, especially when dealing with fractions.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that the question asks for the new contribution amount, not the difference between the old and new contributions."
