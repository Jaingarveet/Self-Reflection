If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?\nChoices:\n  A: 69:91\n  B: 59:91\n  C: 59:90\n  D: 59:91\n  E: 69:101\n\nThought:\nFirst, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy.\nFor alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9=15. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40=16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40=24 grams.\nFor alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11=18. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60=23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60=36.67 grams.\nThen, we add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The amount of zinc is 16+23.33=39.33 grams and the amount of copper is 24+36.67=60.67 grams.\nFinally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio is approximately 39:61, which is not one of the choices.\nHowever, if we round the amounts to the nearest whole number, we get 39 grams of zinc and 61 grams of copper, which gives a ratio of 39:61. This is also not one of the choices.\nTherefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
