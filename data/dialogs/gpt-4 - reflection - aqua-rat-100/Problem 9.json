If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 16\n  C: 24\n  D: 30\n  E: 40\n\nThought: \nThe profit per bag is 25% of the selling price, which is $100. So, the profit per bag is $100 * 25% = $25. \nIf the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $25 = 120 bags.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI miscalculated the profit per bag. I incorrectly assumed that the 25% profit was calculated based on the selling price, while it was actually calculated based on the cost price. This led to an overestimation of the number of bags sold.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Calculation error\n- Profit calculation error\nSolution:\nThe profit per bag is 25% of the cost price. If the selling price is $100, then the cost price is $100 / 1.25 = $80. So, the profit per bag is $100 - $80 = $20.\nIf the total profit is $3000, then the number of bags sold is $3000 / $20 = 150 bags.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand that the profit is calculated based on the cost price, not the selling price.\n2. Calculate the cost price per bag by dividing the selling price by 1 plus the profit percentage.\n3. Calculate the profit per bag by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.\n4. Divide the total profit by the profit per bag to find the number of bags sold.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Be aware of the difference between profit calculated on cost price and selling price.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Practice more problems involving profit and loss to become more familiar with these concepts."
