How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3?\nChoices:\n  A: 277\n  B: 288\n  C: 200\n  D: 277\n  E: 168\n\nThought: \nThe initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 8:5. \nThe final ratio is 4:3. \nSince the same number of boys and girls joined, the difference in the ratios should be equal. \nThe difference in the ratio of boys is 4 - 8 = -4, and the difference in the ratio of girls is 3 - 5 = -2. \nThis means that for every 4 boys that joined, 2 girls joined. \nSince the number of boys and girls that joined is the same, the number of boys and girls that joined is 2 * 2 = 4. \nSo, the total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 4 = 108. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

I incorrectly calculated the difference in the ratios and the number of new members. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of problem\n- Calculation error\n- Ratio error\nSolution:\nThe initial number of boys is 64 and girls is 40. \nThe final ratio of boys to girls is 4:3. \nLet's denote the number of new members as x. \nSo, the number of boys is now 64 + x and the number of girls is 40 + x. \nThe ratio of boys to girls is now (64 + x) : (40 + x) = 4 : 3. \nSolving this equation for x gives x = 24. \nSo, the total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 2x = 64 + 40 + 2*24 = 152.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the initial number of boys and girls.\n2. Understand the final ratio of boys to girls.\n3. Let the number of new members be x.\n4. Set up an equation based on the final ratio.\n5. Solve the equation to find the number of new members.\n6. Add the initial number of boys and girls and twice the number of new members to find the total number of members.\n7.
