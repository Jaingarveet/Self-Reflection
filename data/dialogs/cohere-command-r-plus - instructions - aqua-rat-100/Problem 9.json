Understand the relationship between selling price, profit, and cost price.\n2. Calculate the profit per bag, given as a percentage of the selling price.\n3. Calculate the cost price per bag by subtracting the profit from the selling price.\n4. Set up the equation: total profit equals the cost price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold.\n5. Solve for the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the cost price per bag.\n"

Multiplying the cost price by the number of bags gives the correct answer of $3,000.\n\nThought: \nThe profit per bag is given as 25% of the selling price, which is $100 x 0.25 = $25.\nSo, the cost price per bag is $100 - $25 = $75.\n\nWe know the total profit is $3,000, and we can find the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the cost price per bag: $3,000 / $75 per bag = 40 bags.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
