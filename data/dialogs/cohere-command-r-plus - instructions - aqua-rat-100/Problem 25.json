The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices:\n  A: 5(√3 + 1)\n  B: 6(√3 + √2)\n  C: 7(√3 – 1)\n  D: 8(√3 – 2)\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base as $x$.\n2. Set up trigonometric equations using the angles and ratios: $\\tan(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{x}$ and $\\tan(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{x - 10}$.\n3. Equate these equations and solve for $x$ to find the distance traveled.\n4. Calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$).\n5.

Subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$), we get:\nRemaining distance $= x - 10 = h(1 + \\sqrt{3}) - 10$\n\nConverting hours to minutes, we can represent the remaining distance as:\n$= 60h(1 + \\sqrt{3}) - 10$\n\nDividing by the speed, we can find the time it will take to reach the base:\nTime $= \\frac{60h(1 + \\sqrt{3}) - 10}{v}$\n\nSince the car is traveling at a uniform speed, the height of the tower is irrelevant to the calculation of time. Thus, the height ($h$) and speed ($v$) cancel out, leaving a constant value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $A: 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
