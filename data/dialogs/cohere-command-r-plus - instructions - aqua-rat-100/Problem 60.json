If it is greater, subtract the measure from 1[REDACTED] to find the complementary angle, which represents the minor arc A[REDACTED].\n"

Here is the correct reflection:\n\nGiven:\n- Minor arc AC = 160°\n- Minor arc BD = 150°\n- Point B bisects minor arc AC\n\nFinding minor arc BC:\nSince B bisects AC:\nMinor arc BC = Minor arc AC / 2 = 160° / 2 = 80°\n\nFinding minor arc AB:\nMinor arc AB = Minor arc AC - Minor arc BC = 160° - 80° = 80°\n\nFinding minor arc AD:\nMinor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°\n\nThe correct answer is E: 220°. My previous response incorrectly calculated the measure of minor arc AD as 230°. The correct calculation is 360° - 230° = 130°, as the central angle of the minor arc is supplementary to the minor arc angle."
