In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?\nChoices:\n  A: 21\n  B: 30\n  C: 31\n  D: 32\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question: Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over a 22-month period.\n2. Identify the given values: \n   - Average sales for the first 13 months = 42 microwaves/month\n   - Average sales for the next 10 months = 20 microwaves/month\n3. Calculate the total number of microwaves sold in the first 13 months (step-by-step multiplication).\n4. Calculate the total number of microwaves sold in the next 10 months (step-by-step multiplication).\n5. Find the total number of microwaves sold in the entire 22-month period (sum of the previous two results).\n6. Calculate the average by dividing the total number of microwaves sold by the number of months (22). \n7. Check your calculations and ensure you are performing multiplication and division correctly.\n8. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result.\n"

Understanding the question: We need to find the average number of microwave oven sales per month over a period of 22 months.\n2. Identifying the given values: \n   - Average sales for the first 13 months (last year) = 42 microwaves/month\n   - Average sales for the next 10 months (this year) = 20 microwaves/month\n3. Calculating the total sales for each period:\n   - For the first 13 months: 42 * 13 = 546 microwave ovens\n   - For the next 10 months: 20 * 10 = 200 microwave ovens\n4. Finding the total sales for the 22-month period:\n   - Total sales = 546 + reflecting0 = 746 microwave ovens\n5. Calculating the average monthly sales:\n   - Average = Total sales / Number of months = 746 / 22 = **33.9** microwaves/month\n6. Checking the answer options: The correct answer should be closer to 33.9.\n\nAnswer: None of the provided options are close to our calculated result of 33.9. Therefore, the correct answer should be \"E: None of the above.\"\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
