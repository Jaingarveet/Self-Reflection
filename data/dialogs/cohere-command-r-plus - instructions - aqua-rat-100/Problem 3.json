If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?\nChoices:\n  A: 56\n  B: 58\n  C: 60\n  D: 62\n  E: 64\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the area of the rectangle formed after cutting the square diagonally. \n2. Set up an equation relating the side length of the original square to the area of the rectangle. \n3. Solve the quadratic equation to find the side length of the original square. \n4. Calculate the perimeter of the original square by multiplying the side length by $4$. \n5. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated perimeter.\n"

        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n1. Each triangle formed has an area of $70$ square feet, so the rectangle has an area of $2 \\times 70 = 140$ square feet.\n2. The length and width of the rectangle are sides of the square. Let $x$ be the side length of the original square. Then, the rectangle has dimensions $(x - 4)$ feet by $x$ feet. So, we can set up the equation: \n$(x - 4)x = 140$\n3. Simplifying and solving the quadratic equation:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 4x - 140 &= 0 \\\\\n(x - 10)(x + 14) &= 0\n\\end{align*}\nThe positive solution is $x = 10$ feet.\n4. The perimeter of the original square is $4x = 40$ feet.\nThe correct answer is $60$ feet, which is choice $C$.\n\nHere's the corrected response:"
