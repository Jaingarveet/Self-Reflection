Identify the given values: distance (D), time (6 and 4 hours), and speed increase (12 km/hr). \n2. Set up the equation correctly: equal distances in equal times. \n3. Simplify the equation and isolate [REDACTED] correctly: \n   - Multiply by the common denominator to clear fractions. \n   - Combine like terms. \n   - Divide by the coefficient of [REDACTED] to isolate it. \n4. Check your calculations and ensure the units are consistent. \n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"
