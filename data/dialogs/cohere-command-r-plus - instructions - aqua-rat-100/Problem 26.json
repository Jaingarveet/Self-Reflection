Calculate the area of the rectangle (length x breadth). \n2. Recognize that the area of the rectangle and the square are equal since it is the same wire rebent. \n3. Set up the equation: area of the square = side x side. \n4. Divide the total area by the length of one side to find the side length. \n5. Check your calculations and ensure you have not taken the square root. \n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"

The area of the rectangle = length x breadth = 27 cm x 17 cm = 459 square cm.\n2. The area of the rectangle and the square are equal since it is the same wire rebent. \n3. Area of the square = side x side, so \n459 = side x side\n4. Divide by 'side' on both sides to find the length of one side:\nside = sqrt(459) = 21.4 cm (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nI made an error in my previous attempt by not taking the square root, which resulted in an incorrect side length.\n\nNow, let's answer the question again:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
