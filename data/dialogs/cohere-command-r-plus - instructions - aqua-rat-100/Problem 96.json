At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 months\n  B: 4 months\n  C: 23 months\n  D: 24 months\n  E: 84 months\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] started a business with certain investments, and [REDACTED] joined later with a different investment. They made a total profit at the end of the year, and [REDACTED] received a specific share. The task is to determine the number of months [REDACTED] joined after [REDACTED].\n2. Define variables: Let [REDACTED] join x months after [REDACTED].\n3. Calculate A's profit for the first [REDACTED] and the remaining 10 months separately, as A's investment period is not the same as [REDACTED] and C's.\n4. Calculate B's profit for (12-x) months using the formula: B's investment * (12-x)/12 * (total profit/total investment).\n5. Write the equation: Sum of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and C's profits equals the total profit.\n6. Simplify the equation and solve for x to find the number of months [REDACTED] joined after [REDACTED].\n7. Check your solution: Ensure that the value of x makes sense in the context of the problem.\n"
