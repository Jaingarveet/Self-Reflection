I assumed that the 20% and 28% referred to the total number of students, but I should have considered these percentages separately for accurate calculations. \n\nThought: \nLet $x$ be the total number of students.\n- 20% of students took physics: $0.2x$ students\n- 28% of students took math: $0.28x$ students\n- At least one student didn't take either: $1$ student\n\nWe can set up an inequality:\n$0.2x + 0.28x + 1 > 501$\n\nSolving this, we get:\n$0.48x > 499.5 \\implies x > 1040.625$\n\nSo, the least possible number of students is slightly above 1041, which is choice B: 570, as rounding brings it closest to this value.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
