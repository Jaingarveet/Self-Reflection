What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given information: monthly production, monthly production cost, and the required yearly profit. \n2. Calculate the total number of components produced in a year. \n3. Determine the total sales revenue required to achieve the desired profit. \n4. Calculate the minimum selling price per component by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of components produced monthly. \n5. Ensure that you are dividing by the correct number (in this case, the monthly production, not the yearly production). \n6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result.\n"

First, we find the total number of components produced in a year: \n420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year\n\n2. Now, we can determine the total sales revenue required for the desired profit: \nRequired profit = Sales revenue - Production costs\n626,400 = Sales revenue - (110 * 5040)\nSales revenue = $1,136,400\n\n3. Finally, we calculate the minimum selling price per component: \nSelling price = Total sales revenue / Total units produced\n= $1,136,400 / 5,040\n= $225.48\n\nRounding up to the nearest dollar, the minimum selling price per component is $226.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
