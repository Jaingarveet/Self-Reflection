Each day, it jumps 3 meters up but falls back by 2 meters, so its net gain per day is 1 meter (3 - 2 = 1). To reach ground level, it has to cover a total distance of 28 meters. Therefore, it will take 28 days to reach the surface (28 / 1 = 28). However, on the first day, it already jumped 2 meters, so we subtract that from the total count, giving us a final answer of 26 days.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
