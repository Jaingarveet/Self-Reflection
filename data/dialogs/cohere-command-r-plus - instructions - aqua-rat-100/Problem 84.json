This means Susan can take either the leftmost or center chair.\n\nIf Susan takes the left chair, there are 2 remaining children (Tim and Zen) to arrange on 2 chairs, which can be done in 2! = 2 ways.\n\nIf Susan takes the center chair, then:\n- Tim must be to her right, so there is only 1 way to arrange them in the center and right chairs.\n- This leaves Zen to occupy the left chair.\n\nSo far, we have a total of 2 + 1 = 3 arrangements.\n\nHowever, we haven't considered the arrangements where Susan is to the right of Tim. This can occur in 3! - 3 = 3 ways (subtracting the arrangements we've already counted).\n\nAdding this to our previous total, we get 3 + 3 = 6 possible arrangements, choice E.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
