However, her statement actually meant that her weight included 29 kg and half of her weight. This crucial distinction changes the equation I need to solve.\n\nCorrect Solution:\nMeenu's statement can be represented by the equation:\nx = 29 + x/2\n\nCombining the fractions:\n2x = 58\n\nDividing by 2:\nx = 29 kg\n\nSo, Meenu weighs 29 kg.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
