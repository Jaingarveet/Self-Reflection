Understand the given information: the man's rates in still water and against the current.\n2. Define variables: let 'x' be the man's rate along the current and 'y' be the current's rate.\n3. Set up a system of equations: use the given rates to create two equations.\n4. Solve the system: add the equations to find the value of 'x'.\n5.

        "content": "Reflection: The correct answer is B: 6 kmph.\n\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in calculating the man's rate along the current. I added the rates instead of subtracting them, which led to an incorrect value.\n\nHere is the correct solution:\nLet's define the man's rate along the current as \"x kmph\" and the current's rate as \"y kmph.\" \n\nWe know that:\n1. The man's rate in still water (x + y) is 4 kmph.\n2. The man's rate against the current (x - y) is 2 kmph.\n\nSetting up a system of equations:\n1. x + y = 4\n2. x - y = 2\n\nSolving for x and y:\nAdding the two equations: \n2x = 6\n\nDividing by 2:\nx = 3\n\nThe man's rate along the current is 3 kmph. \n\nNow, we can substitute x into one of the equations to find y:\n3 + y = 4\n\nSolving for y:\ny = 1\n\nSo, the current's rate is 1 kmph. \n\nTherefore, the man's rate along the current is 3 kmph, which is choice B."
