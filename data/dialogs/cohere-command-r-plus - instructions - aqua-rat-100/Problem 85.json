        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in interpreting the relationship between the number of steps and the time taken. The correct interpretation is that when walking 20 steps at a time, it takes half as much time (10 minutes) as walking 10 steps at a time (20 minutes). This indicates an inverse relationship, not a direct one.\n\nCorrect solution:\nLet's define the unknown speed as 'x' steps/minute.\n\nWhen walking 20 steps at a time:\nTime = 10 minutes\nSteps = 20x minutes (as it takes 20 times the speed to cover the steps in the given time)\n\nWhen walking 10 steps at a time:\nTime = 20 minutes\nSteps = 10x minutes\n\nNow, we can set up equations based on these relationships:\n1) 20x = 10\n2) 10x = 20\n\nSolving each equation:\n1) x = 10/20 = 1/2 steps/minute\n2) x = 20/10 = 2 steps/minute\n\nWe can see that x = 2 steps/minute satisfies both equations. \n\nAnswer: B"
