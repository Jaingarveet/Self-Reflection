Understand the question: Identify the given information and the task.\n2. Interpret the task: Recognize that the question asks for the total time to consume all tablets, not the time interval.\n3. Calculate the total time: Convert the time interval to a fraction of an hour and multiply it by the number of tablets.\n4. Convert to minutes: Ensure the final answer is in minutes.\n5.

I thought the question was asking about the time interval between tablets, which is 15 minutes, but instead, it asks for the total time to consume all 5 tablets.\n\nCorrect interpretation: To find the total time, we need to multiply the time interval by the number of tablets. \n\nCorrect answer calculation: Each tablet is taken after 15 minutes, so the time taken for 5 tablets = 5 x 15 minutes = 75 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 75 minutes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
