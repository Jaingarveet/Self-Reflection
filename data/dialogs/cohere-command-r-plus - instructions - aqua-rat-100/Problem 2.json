        "content": "Reflection: I made an error in my previous attempt; I added the increase in weight to the average weight of the original 10 vehicles to find the weight of the new truck, which was incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the total weight of the original vehicles and then find the new total weight after adding the new truck, using the given increase in average weight. Finally, I should find the difference between these two totals to determine the weight of the new truck.\n\nThought: \nFirst, we calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles: \n10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons\n\nThen, we find the new total weight after adding the new truck: \nNew average weight = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons\nTotal weight with 11 vehicles = 14.8 tons/vehicle * 11 vehicles = 162.8 tons\n\nFinally, we find the weight of the new truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight: \n162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons\n\nSo, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
