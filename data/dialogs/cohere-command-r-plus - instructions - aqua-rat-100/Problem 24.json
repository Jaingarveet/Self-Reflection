If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?\nChoices:\n  A: (zy – 2x)/z\n  B: (zy – 2)/z\n  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)\n  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)\n  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the variables: x = average of highest and lowest scores, y = average of the entire class, z = number of students.\n2. Recognize that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.\n3. Calculate the sum of the remaining scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers: zy - 2x.\n4. Determine the number of remaining students: z - 2.\n5. Find the average score for the remaining students by dividing the sum of their scores by the number of students: ((zy - 2x) / (z - 2)).\n6. Ensure your algebraic manipulations are correct and that you are properly applying the order of operations.\n"
