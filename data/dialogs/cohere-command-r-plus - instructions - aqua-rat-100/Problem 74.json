        "content": "Reflection: There are 15 different ways to choose 4 points out of the 6 given points.\nHowever, we must consider the cases where the sides intersect and those that include the center point, F.\n\nFirst, let's count the total number of ways to choose 4 points out of the 6 given points. This can be done using combinations: \n$_6C_4 = 15$ options.\n\nNow, we need to identify how many of these options create intersecting lines and, therefore, cannot form a valid quadrilateral. There are 5 vertices in the pentagon, and choosing 4 vertices will create 2 opposite vertices that will always intersect. Subtract 5 choices for these cases.\n\nNext, let's consider the quadrilaterals that include point F (the center of the pentagon). It can be connected to any group of 3 points from the 5 vertices, and there will be no intersection. This gives us $ _5C_3 = 10$ choices.\n\nFinally, add the two counts together: \n15 choices - 5 intersecting choices + 10 choices including F = 20 quadrilaterals.\n \nAnswer: D"
