Understand the problem: friends planned to spend a certain amount, but some didn't show up, increasing the cost for those who attended. \n2. Set up two equations: one for the original plan and one for the updated plan. \n3. Isolate for 'n' in both equations. \n4. Set the two equations equal to each other, representing the relationship between the original and updated plans. \n5. Simplify the equation and solve for 'n'. \n6. Interpret the result: 'n' is the total number of friends, so subtract 4 to find the number who attended.\n"

The total amount spent must be equal to the number of friends attending multiplied by the contribution each friend made. I made a mistake previously by [REDACTED].\n\nThought: \nLet $n$ be the number of friends who planned to go on the picnic.\n\nThe friends planned to spend $\\text{Rs. } 96$ on eatables, so:\n$$n \\times \\text{Rs. } 24 = \\text{Rs. } 96$$\n\nFour friends did not turn up, so $n - 4$ friends attended and had to contribute $\\text{Rs. } 28$ each:\n$$(n - 4) \\times \\text{Rs. } 28 = \\text{Rs. } 96$$\n\nSetting these equations equal to each other:\n$$n \\times \\text{Rs. } 24 = (n - 4) \\times \\text{Rs. } 28$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for $n$:\n$$n \\times 24 = n \\times 28 - 4 \\times 28$$\n$$n \\times 4 = 112$$\n$$n = \\frac{112}{4} = 28$$\n\nTherefore, the total number of friends who planned to go on the picnic was $28$, and subtracting those who didn't attend:\n$$28 - 4 = \\text{24 friends attended.}$$\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
