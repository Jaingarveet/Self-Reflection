Understand the problem: Karan wants to mark up the price of a sewing machine to make a 20% profit, even after offering a 20% discount.\n2. Calculate the price after the desired profit: Multiply the cost price by 120% to find the price that will give Karan a 20% profit.\n3. Calculate the price after the discount: Multiply the price from step 2 by 80% to find the price after offering a 20% discount.\n4. Set up the equation: Let 'x' be the marked price. Write the equation as: x - 0.8x = 1440\n5. Solve the equation: Simplify the equation and find the value of 'x' (marked price).\n6. Check your calculations: Ensure that your calculations are accurate and that you have considered all the given information.\n7. Choose the correct answer: Select the option that matches your calculated marked price.\n"
