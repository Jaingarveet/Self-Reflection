Understand the problem: [REDACTED] travels in different directions and wants to know the final distance from home.\n2. Identify the net displacement in each direction: south-north cancels out, leaving 3 km east and 2 km north.\n3. Recognize that the east-west and south-north displacements are independent and not perpendicular.\n4.
