Understand the problem: Identify the given information and what needs to be solved. \n2. Define variables: Let 'x' represent the man's monthly income. \n3. Set up the equation: Subtract his savings (12.5% of income) from his income to get expenses. \n4. Solve the equation: Isolate 'x' to find the value of monthly income. \n5.

The correct way is to divide by 100% to get the actual income.\n\n1. The problem is to find the man's monthly income given his expenses and savings percentage.\n2. Let 'x' be the man's monthly income.\n3. Equation: (100% - 12.5%) * x = 3500, or 0.875x = 3500\n4. Solving for 'x', we divide by 0.875: x = 3500 / 0.875 = Rs. 4000\n5. Answer: \"C\" is the correct choice, matching the calculated result of Rs. 4000.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
