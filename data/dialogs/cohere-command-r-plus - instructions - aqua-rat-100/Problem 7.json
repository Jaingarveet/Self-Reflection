The first 10 letters can be used as single-letter codes, and the remaining 16 letters can form 120 unique pairs (15 x 16 / 2). So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create these codes is 26, which is choice E.\n\nReflection: The previous incorrect answer selection was due to an oversight in considering the number of possible letter pairs.
