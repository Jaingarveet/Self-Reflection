At least one of the same employees in both groups.\n\nThe current composition of the printing group is F, H, L, and M, and the binding group is G, H, and J.\n\nIf K replaces F, it would violate condition (2) since F and K cannot be in the same group.\nIf K replaces G, it would not violate any conditions, but we need to check if J can be added to the binding group without violating any conditions. Since the binding group already has 3 members, adding J would result in 4 members, which is allowed.\nIf K replaces H, it would violate condition (5) since H is the only common member between the two groups.\nIf K replaces L, it would not violate any conditions, but we need to check if J can be added to the printing group without violating any conditions. Since the printing group already has 4 members, adding J would result in 5 members, which is not allowed.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
