I incorrectly assumed that if F participates, then G cannot participate, but this is not stated in the conditions. In fact, if F participates, then M can participate, and the team would be F, K, H, and M.\n"

If F participates, then M can participate, and the team would be F, K, H, and M.\n\nB: G and J - This is not possible. If J participates, then G participates, but this would mean that both G and J are selected, leaving only two spots for the remaining players. However, since E or F must participate, but not both, and one of J or K must participate, but not both, there would not be enough spots for all the required players.\n\nC: G and M - This is not possible. If M participates, then F must participate. However, if F participates, there is no requirement for G to participate.\n\nD: H and M - This is not possible. If M participates, then F must participate.
