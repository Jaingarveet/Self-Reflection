To doubt this assertion, we need to find a statement that suggests that land prices are not the primary cause of rising housing prices.\n\nOption A shows that housing prices in Shanghai increased by a larger percentage than land prices, but it does not provide enough information to doubt the assertion.\n\nOption B shows that residential prices in Beijing increased by a larger percentage than land prices, but again, it does not provide enough information to doubt the assertion.\n\nOption C supports the assertion that rising land prices cause housing prices to increase.\n\nOption D provides an alternative explanation for soaring housing prices, suggesting that supply has not kept up with demand. This statement doubts the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
