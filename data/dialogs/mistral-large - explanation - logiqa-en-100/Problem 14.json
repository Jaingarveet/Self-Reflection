Human Resources (HR) and Sales are not adjacent.\n2. Finance is next to Planning.\n3. Administration is above Planning but below HR.\n4. HR is not at the upper level of Administration.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce that:\n\n* Planning and Finance must be on the first and second floors, in any order.\n* Administration must be on the third floor, as it is above Planning but below HR.\n* HR cannot be on the fourth floor, as it is not at the upper level of Administration. So, HR must be on the fifth or sixth floor.\n* Sales cannot be adjacent to HR, so Sales cannot be on the fourth or sixth floor.\n\nNow let's evaluate the choices:\nA: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department\n\n* This could be possible if R&D is on the first floor and Sales is on the second floor, but we know that Planning and Finance occupy the first and second floors.\n\nB: The sales department is one level above the administrative department\n\n* This is not possible, as Sales cannot be on the fourth floor (adjacent to HR).\n\nC: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department\n\n* This could be possible if Planning is on the first floor, Finance is on the second floor, and Sales is on the third floor.\n\nD: Sales Department is on the second floor\n\n* This is not possible, as Finance is next to Planning, so they occupy the first and second floors.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
