This can be expressed as the equation:\ny + 30 = 2(x - 30)\nFrom the second statement, we know that if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. This can be expressed as the equation:\nx + 10 = 3(y - 10)\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\ny + 30 = 2(x - 30)\nx + 10 = 3(y - 10)\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.\nUsing substitution, we can solve for y in the first equation:\ny = 2x - 90\nSubstituting this value of y into the second equation, we get:\nx + 10 = 3(2x - 90 - 10)\nx + 10 = 6x - 300\n5x = 310\nx = 62\nSubstituting this value of x back into the first equation, we get:\ny + 30 = 2(62 - 30)\ny + 30 = 64\ny = 34\nTherefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
