This means that he had already driven x - 70 miles from A to B.\nThe time it takes Kevin to drive x - 70 miles from A to B is (x - 70)/70 hours.\nThe time it takes Kevin to drive 70 miles from B to A is 70/90 = 7/9 hours.\nThe total time of the trip up to this point is (x - 70)/70 + 7/9 = 3 - 3 = 0 hours.\nThis means that Kevin had already driven x - 70 miles from A to B and 70 miles from B to A, which is a total of x miles.\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is x = 180 miles.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
