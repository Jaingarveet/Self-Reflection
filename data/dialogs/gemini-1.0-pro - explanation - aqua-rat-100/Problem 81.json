I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\nHere is my self-reflection:\n* I initially thought that the question was asking for the minimum amount of health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. However, the question actually asks for the amount of health food needed to meet the minimum daily requirement of **both** vitamins.\n* I realized that my mistake was in not carefully reading the question. I need to be more careful in reading the questions and understanding what they are asking.\n* I also realized that I need to be more careful in my calculations. I need to make sure that I am using the correct numbers and that I am not making any mistakes.\nI have learned from my mistake and I will be more careful in the future.\nHere is my solution to the question:\nLet x be the number of grams of health food that must be eaten daily.\nThe amount of vitamin E in x grams of health food is 0.09x.\nThe amount of vitamin A in x grams of health food is 0.08x.\nTo meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need:\n0.09x >= 1\n0.08x >= 1\nSolving for x in each inequality, we get:\nx >= 11.11\nx >= 12.5\nTherefore, the minimum amount of health food that must be eaten daily is 12.5 grams.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
