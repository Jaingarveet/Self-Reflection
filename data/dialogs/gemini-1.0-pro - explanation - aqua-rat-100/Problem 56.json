After reflecting on my solution, I realized I made a mistake in calculating the total interest paid. \nHere's the corrected approach:\n1. **Total amount paid:** 12 installments * Rs.31.50/installment = Rs.378\n2. **Interest paid:** Rs.378 (total paid) - Rs.360 (principal) = Rs.18\n3. **Interest rate:** (Interest paid / Principal) * (12 months / Time period) = (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * (12 months / 1 year) = 0.05 * 12 = 0.6 or 60%\nTherefore, the interest rate is 60%. \nHowever, this answer choice is not available.
