I apologize for the error.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially thought that the chairs were distinct, which led me to overestimate the number of arrangements.\n* **Correction:** I realized that the chairs are identical, so the arrangement of Susan and Tim on the leftmost two chairs is unique.\n* **Revised Approach:** I will consider the arrangement of Susan and Tim as a single unit, and then arrange this unit along with Zen on the remaining chair.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Arrange Susan and Tim:** There are 2! = 2 ways to arrange Susan and Tim on the leftmost two chairs.\n2. **Arrange the Unit and Zen:** There are 2 ways to arrange the unit of Susan and Tim and Zen on the remaining chair.\n**Total Arrangements:** 2 * 2 = 4\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
