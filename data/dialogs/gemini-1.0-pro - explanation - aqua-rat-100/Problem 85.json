I have reflected on my mistake and realized that I did not consider the time it takes to walk down the stairs.\nHere is my revised solution:\nLet's assume the elevator has a constant speed of x steps per minute.\nIn the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means you walk down 20 steps in 10 minutes, which is a speed of 2 steps per minute.\nIn the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means you walk down 10 steps in 20 minutes, which is a speed of 0.5 steps per minute.\nSince the elevator has a constant speed, the speed in both scenarios should be the same. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 0.5 steps per minute.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
