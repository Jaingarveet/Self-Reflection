I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\nHere is my self-reflection:\n* I initially thought that the question was asking for the total number of bike numbers that could be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, regardless of whether the letters were distinct. However, I realized that the question is actually asking for the total number of bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, where the letters must be distinct.\n* I made the mistake of not carefully reading the question and not paying attention to the detail that the letters must be distinct.\n* I have learned that it is important to carefully read the question and pay attention to all of the details.\n* I have also learned that it is important to double-check my work to make sure that I have not made any mistakes.\nI will now use my self-reflection to answer the question correctly.\nHere is my solution:\n* There are 26 letters in the alphabet.\n* There are 10 numbers.\n* There are 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 = 67600 possible bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers.\n* However, we need to subtract the number of bike numbers that have repeated letters.\n* There are 26 * 25 * 10 * 10 = 65000 possible bike numbers that have repeated letters.\n* Therefore, there are 67600 - 65000 = 2600 possible bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, where the letters must be distinct.\nTherefore, the answer is 2600.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
