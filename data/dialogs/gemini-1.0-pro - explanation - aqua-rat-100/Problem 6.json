I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the total work incorrectly, leading to an incorrect answer.\n* **Reasoning:** I did not consider the different rates of each worker and the time they spent working.\n* **Correction:** I will carefully calculate the work done by each worker and the remaining work to be completed by Mr. Blue.\n**Solution:**\n* Mr. Brown paints 1/6 of a house per day.\n* Mr. Black paints 1/8 of a house per day.\n* Mr. Blue paints 1/12 of a house per day.\n**Work done in 8 days:**\n* Mr. Brown: 8 days * 1/6 house/day = 4/3 houses\n* Mr. Black: 6 days * 1/8 house/day = 3/4 house\n**Remaining work:**\n* 3 houses - 4/3 houses - 3/4 house = 5/12 house\n**Time for Mr. Blue to complete the remaining work:**\n* 5/12 house / (1/12 house/day) = 5 days\n**Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 5 days to complete the contract.**\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")**"
