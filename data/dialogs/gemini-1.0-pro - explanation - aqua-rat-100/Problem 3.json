        "content": "I apologize for the previous incorrect answer. I have reviewed my thought process and identified the error. I incorrectly assumed that the diagonal cut divided the square into two equal triangles. However, this is not necessarily true. To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the possibility that the diagonal cut creates two unequal triangles.\nHere's the corrected solution:\n1. Let the original side length of the square be x feet.\n2. After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangle become (x-4) feet by x feet.\n3. The diagonal of the rectangle divides it into two right triangles.\n4. Let the base of each triangle be (x-4) feet.\n5. Let the height of one triangle be h1 feet and the height of the other triangle be h2 feet.\n6. Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we have:\n   - (1/2) * (x-4) * h1 = 70\n   - (1/2) * (x-4) * h2 = 70\n7. Solving for h1 and h2, we get:\n   - h1 = 140/(x-4)\n   - h2 = 140/(x-4)\n8. Since the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of each triangle, we have:\n   - x^2 = (x-4)^2 + h1^2\n   - x^2 = (x-4)^2 + h2^2\n9. Substituting the values of h1 and h2 from step 7, we get:\n   - x^2 = (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2\n   - x^2 = (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2\n10. Solving this equation for x, we get x = 20.\n11. Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth was 4 * 20 = 80 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
