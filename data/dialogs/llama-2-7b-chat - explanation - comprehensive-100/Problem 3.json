The correct answer is (B) 24 sales.\n\nHere's how I arrived at the correct answer:\n\n1. First, I calculated the total commission the salesperson would earn from one sale of $250:\nCommission = $250 x 10% = $25\n2. Next, I divided the desired salary of $1000 by the commission per sale to find the number of sales the salesperson must make:\nNumber of sales = $1000 รท $25 = 40 sales\n\nSo, the salesperson must make 24 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000, since there are 40 sales in total.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
