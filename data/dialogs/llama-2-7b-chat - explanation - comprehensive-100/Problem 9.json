What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?\nChoices:\n  A: 800\n  B: 720\n  C: 960\n  D: 1140\n  E: 1160\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the conversion ratio between the map distance and the actual distance.\n\nThe correct conversion ratio is 1/4 inch on the map = 10 miles, not 1/4 inch on the map = 1 mile.\n\nSo, if the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches on the map, the actual distance can be found by multiplying the map distance by 10, not by 1.\n\nThe correct answer is (20 x 10) = 200 miles.\n"
