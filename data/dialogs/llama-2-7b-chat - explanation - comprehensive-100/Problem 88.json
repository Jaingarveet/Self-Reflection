However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option does not align with the context of the passage. The text is providing tips on how to care for one's skin while traveling, and option [REDACTED] does not address this topic directly. Instead, it suggests that the reader should mentally go through their day and think about when and where they use skin products, which is an important step in packing the necessary items for their trip. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is option B: [substeps] Since traveling can get expensive, some drug stores sell makeup and toiletry bags.

The text is providing tips on how to care for one's skin while traveling, and option B addresses this topic directly by suggesting that the reader can purchase makeup and toiletry bags at drug stores, which is an important consideration when traveling. Additionally, the option highlights the importance of packing a cleansing cloth, which is a basic product that is often overlooked when traveling."
