Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (E) [REDACTED] This information weakens the argument that violent crime in the town is becoming a serious problem because it suggests that the root cause of the issue is not the overall number of violent crimes, but rather the actions of a small group of repeat offenders. If the town can identify and address the issues surrounding these repeat offenders, it may be able to reduce the overall number of violent crimes in the area.\n\nHere's why the other options do not weaken the argument:\n\nA) The town's overall crime rate appearing to rise slightly this year compared to the same period last year does not necessarily affect the argument. While it may indicate a broader trend in crime, it does not necessarily explain the specific issue of violent crime.\n\nB) The age of the victim being a factor in the likelihood of being a victim of violent crime does not directly address the issue of violent crime in the town.\n\nC) The fact that more people are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities may actually strengthen the argument, as it suggests that there is a greater awareness and concern about violent crime in the town.\n\nD) Opening a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers may actually help to address the issue of violent crime by providing alternative activities and support for young people who may be at risk of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is (E) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town, as it directly addresses the issue of violent crime and suggests that the root cause may be more easily addressed.\n"
