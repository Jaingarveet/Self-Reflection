Drug to treat such a case is:\nChoices:\n  A: Topical antibiotic\n  B: Benzoyl peroxide\n  C: Retinoids\n  D: Estrogen\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI selected option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], as the drug to treat comedonal acne, but the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].\n\nComedonal acne is a type of acne that occurs when dead skin cells and oil clog pores. [REDACTED] is an antibacterial agent that can help kill the bacteria that contribute to acne, but it is not effective in treating comedonal acne. [REDACTED], on the other hand, are derived from vitamin [REDACTED] and are effective in treating comedonal acne by preventing dead skin cells from clogging pores and reducing inflammation.\n"

However, upon further reflection, I realized that comedonal acne is caused by dead skin cells and oil clogging pores, rather than bacterial infection. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, retinoids, which are derived from vitamin A and are effective in treating comedonal acne by preventing dead skin cells from clogging pores and reducing inflammation.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer, and I hope this reflection helps me provide a more accurate response to this question in the future."
