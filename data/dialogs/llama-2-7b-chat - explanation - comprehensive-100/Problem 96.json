However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which is the primary structure of a protein.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids that make up the protein. This structure is not affected by denaturation, as the sequence of amino acids is still the same regardless of the protein's conformation.\n\nOn the other hand, the quaternary structure of a protein refers to the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) in a protein. This structure can be affected by denaturation, as the subunits may become disrupted or rearranged, leading to a change in the overall structure of the protein.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which is the primary structure of a protein."
