The question asked for the statement that describes why the snack is a mixture, and while [REDACTED] is true, it doesn't provide the reasoning. Option [REDACTED] gives the key reason - the components in a mixture retain their original properties. I focused too much on the number of substances rather than on the behavior of those substances in a mixture.\n"

Let's consider each choice:\nA: A mixture is indeed made up of more than one substance, but this alone doesn't fully explain why it's a mixture.\nB: This is incorrect. The substances in a mixture can be separated, unlike in a compound.\nC: This is the key characteristic of a mixture - the components retain their original properties. They don't chemically combine or change.\nD: In a mixture, the components do not chemically combine with each other. If they did, it would be a compound, not a mixture.\nBased on the explanation from my previous self-reflection, I now recognize that option C provides the fundamental reason why the snack is classified as a mixture.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
