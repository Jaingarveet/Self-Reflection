This obstruction can cause vomiting, especially in infants, and requires prompt diagnosis. \n\nThe investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis is abdominal ultrasound ([REDA[REDACTED]ED]). Ultrasound is highly sensitive for detecting pyloric stenosis and can identify characteristic features, such as a thickened pyloric muscle and an enlarged, \"hourglass-shaped\" stomach. This non-invasive imaging technique provides valuable information for diagnosis and treatment planning.\n"
