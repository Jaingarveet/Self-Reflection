While the [REDACTED] is important for salt and water reabsorption, it is the collecting duct that plays a crucial role in regulating the acid-base balance of urine. The collecting duct is the principal site of urine acidification through the secretion of hydrogen ions (H+). This process is regulated by aldosterone and is essential for maintaining the body's pH balance.\n"
