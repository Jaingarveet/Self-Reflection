Aspiration issues following lateral skull base surgery most likely indicate SLN injury as this nerve controls the movements of the muscles involved in swallowing and breathing. The vagus nerve has a role in sensation and motor function, but it is not directly responsible for aspiration or swallowing.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
