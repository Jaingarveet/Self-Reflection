When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*√72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34. This small error propagated through my calculation, leading me to incorrectly conclude that the upper bound for x was 63.64, when in fact it should have been slightly lower.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Square root approximation error\n - Upper bound calculation error\nSolution:\nLet's recalculate the upper bound for x when n=72:\nx = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)\n  = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)\n  = 7000 / 109.9\n  = 63.69\nSo the correct range for x when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 is:\n31.75 < x < 63.69\nLooking at the choices again, the only one that fits this range is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Simplify the expression for x as much as possible.\n2. Identify the lower and upper bounds for n given in the question.\n3. Calculate the value of x at the lower bound of n.\n4. Calculate the value of x at the upper bound of n.\n5. When calculating with square roots, use a calculator for precision.\n6. Identify the range that x falls into based on the calculations.\n7. Select the answer choice that matches the identified range for x.\nAdvice:\n - Always simplify complex expressions as much as possible before substituting values.\n - Pay close attention to the bounds given for variables in the question.\n - Use a calculator for calculations involving roots or other irrational numbers.\n - Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with approximations.\n - Carefully compare your calculated range to the given answer choices.\n - If your range doesn't match any of the choices exactly, consider which choice it fits into.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Simplify the expression for x:\n   x = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n2. The bounds for n are: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72\n3. Calculate x at the lower bound (n = 36):\n   x = (36^2 + 2*36*√36 + 8*36 + 16) / (36 + 4*√36 + 4)\n     = (1296 + 432 + 288 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)\n     = 2032 / 64\n     = 31.75\n4. Calculate x at the upper bound (n = 72):\n   x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)\n     = (5184 + 1224.744 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.941 + 4)\n     = 7000.744 / 109.941\n     = 63.68\n5.
