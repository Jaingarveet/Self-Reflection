If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?\nChoices:\n  A: 80°\n  B: 130°\n  C: 140°\n  D: 160°\n  E: 220°\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning about the position of point [REDACTED] on the circle relative to points [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] was on the major arc A[REDACTED], leading me to calculate an incorrect measure for minor arc A[REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misinterpretation of problem statement\n - Incorrect spatial reasoning\n - Incorrect circle geometry\nSolution:\n1) If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then minor arc A[REDACTED] is half of minor arc A[REDACTED].\n   Minor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] / 2 = [REDACTED]\n2) Since the total of a circle is 360°, and minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], major arc A[REDACTED] must be:\n   Major arc A[REDACTED] = 360° - [REDACTED] = 200°\n3) Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], it also bisects major arc A[REDACTED].\n   Major arc A[REDACTED] = 200° / 2 = 100°\n4) Minor arc B[REDACTED] is given as 150°.\n5) Since points [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of the circle, [REDACTED] must be between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].\n6) To find minor arc A[REDACTED], we need to add minor arc A[REDACTED] and minor arc B[REDACTED].\n   Minor arc A[REDACTED] = Minor arc A[REDACTED] + Minor arc BD\n                = [REDACTED] + 150°\n                = [REDACTED]\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully, noting the order of points on the circle.\n2. If one arc bisects another, calculate the measure of the resulting arcs.\n3. Use the fact that the sum of the measures of a minor arc and major arc is 360°.\n4. Visualize the circle and the position of the points to understand their relationships.\n5. To find the measure of an arc between two points, add or subtract the measures of known arcs as appropriate based on the position of the points.\n6. Double-check your calculations.\n7. Select the answer choice that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem statement carefully, noting any given relationships between points or arcs.\n - Visualize the problem by sketching the circle and labeling the given information. \n - Remember that in a circle, the sum of a minor arc and its corresponding major arc is always 360°.\n - When calculating the measure of an arc between two points, consider the position of the points and whether you need to add or subtract the measures of known arcs.\n - If your calculated answer doesn't match any of the choices, re-check your assumptions and calculations.\n - Practice problems involving circles and arcs to improve your spatial reasoning skills.\n"

Since minor arc AC is 160°, major arc ADC must be:\n   Major arc ADC = 360° - 160° = 200°\n4) Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects major arc ADC.\n   Major arc AB = Major arc BC = 200° / 2 = 100°\n5) Minor arc BD is given as 150°.\n6) Since points A, B, C, D lie in this order, D must be between B and C.\n7) To find minor arc AD, we need to add minor arc AB and minor arc BD.\n   Minor arc AD = Minor arc AB + Minor arc BD\n                = 80° + 150°\n                = 230°\n8) Checking the answer choices, 230° is not listed.
