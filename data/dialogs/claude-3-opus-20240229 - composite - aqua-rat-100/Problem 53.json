        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my calculations when solving the system of equations. Specifically, I made a mistake in step 4 when substituting the value of x from Equation 2 into Equation 1. This led me to incorrectly calculate the amount of money Sajal has, which in turn caused me to select the wrong answer.\nError Keywords:\n - Algebraic substitution error\n - Equation solving error\n - Calculation error\nSolution:\nLet's solve this problem again, step-by-step:\n1. Let's assume Arjun has 'x' dollars and Sajal has 'y' dollars.\n2. According to the first condition:\n   If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.\n   Mathematically, y + 30 = 2(x - 30)\n   Simplifying, y + 30 = 2x - 60\n   y = 2x - 90 ... (Equation 1)\n3. According to the second condition:\n   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.\n   Mathematically, x + 10 = 3(y - 10)\n   Simplifying, x + 10 = 3y - 30\n   x = 3y - 40 ... (Equation 2)\n4. Substitute the value of y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   x = 3(2x - 90) - 40\n   x = 6x - 270 - 40\n   x = 6x - 310\n   5x = 310\n   x = 62\n5. Now, substitute x = 62 into Equation 1:\n   y = 2(62) - 90\n   y = 124 - 90\n   y = 34\nTherefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the unknown variables and assign them symbols (e.g., x and y).\n2. Write equations based on the given conditions.\n3. Solve the equations by substituting one equation into the other.\n4. Simplify the resulting equation to find the value of one variable.\n5. Substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.\n6. Double-check your calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated results.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before attempting to solve it.\n - Identify the key information and conditions given in the problem.\n - Assign variables to unknown quantities and write equations based on the given conditions.\n - When solving a system of equations, substitute one equation into the other to eliminate one variable.\n - Always simplify equations step-by-step and show your work.\n - Double-check your calculations at each step to catch any errors early on.\n - Verify that your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\n"
