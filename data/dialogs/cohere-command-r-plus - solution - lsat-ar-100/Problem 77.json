        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's re-examine the rules and the options for each employee: \n- Robertson must be assigned one of the first [REDACTED] spaces (#1 to #4). This means that [REDACTED] of these [REDACTED] spaces will be taken, leaving the remaining [REDACTED] employees with more flexibility. \n- Young must have a higher number than Togowa. If Togowa is assigned #1, it doesn't restrict Young's options; Young could still be assigned any of the remaining [REDACTED] spaces (#2 to #6). \n- Xu must have a higher number than Souza, but this rule doesn't limit their options significantly. \n\nNow, let's consider Young, Xu, and Souza: \n- Young has [REDACTED] options if Togowa takes #1 (#2 to #6). \n- Xu has [REDACTED] options if Souza takes #1 or #2. \n- Souza has [REDACTED] options if Xu takes any space from #1 to #4. \n\nTherefore, at most, [REDACTED] employees (Robertson, Young, Xu, and Souza) are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces each.\n"
