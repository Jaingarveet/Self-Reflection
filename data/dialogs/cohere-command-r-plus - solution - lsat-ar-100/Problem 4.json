Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nGiven that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Wednesday morning: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] (must be on the same day)\n- Wednesday afternoon: [REDACTED] (Lan cannot be on the same day)\n- Thursday morning: [REDACTED] (must be before [REDACTED])\n- Thursday afternoon: [REDACTED] (must be in the afternoon)\n- Friday morning: Lan (by elimination)\n- Friday afternoon: [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (by elimination, and they must be on the same day)\n\nTherefore, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session, fulfilling the condition that his session occurs before [REDACTED]'s on Friday.\n"
