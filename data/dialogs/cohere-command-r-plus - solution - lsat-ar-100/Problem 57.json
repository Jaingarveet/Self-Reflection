Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?\nChoices:\n  A: George and Lenore\n  B: Helen and Nina\n  C: Irving and Robert\n  D: Kyle and Nina\n  E: Olivia and Kyle\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nGeorge must give a report on Tuesday, so we can fill in his name for one of the spots on that day. \n\nOlivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they will take the morning spots on two of the days. \n\nIf Nina gives a report, then the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports. However, this does not mean that Nina, Helen, and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday. It simply sets a condition for their reports. \n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nOption [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - George must give a report on Tuesday, so if Lenore pairs with him, there are no restrictions on who can present on Wednesday. This doesn't provide any useful information.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If Nina gives her report on Tuesday morning, then Helen can give a report on Tuesday afternoon. This fulfills the condition that Helen and Irving give reports the day after Nina. Wednesday is still available for two other students. This option satisfies all the conditions and is, therefore, the correct answer.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option doesn't provide any additional information or constraints, so we can dismiss it.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Nina still needs Helen and Irving to present the day after her, so this option doesn't work.\n\nOption [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option doesn't provide any additional information or constraints, so we can dismiss it.\n"
