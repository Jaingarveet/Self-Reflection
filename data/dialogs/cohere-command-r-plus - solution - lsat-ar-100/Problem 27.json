The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven constraints:\n- Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.\n- Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.\n- Lopez and Megregian do not review any plays that Jiang reviews.\n- Exactly two students review the same plays overall.\n\nLopez and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane together, as this would mean they review the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill, contradicting the constraint that exactly two students should have the same set of plays.\n\nJiang cannot review Tamerlane without overlapping with Lopez and Megregian, so Jiang also cannot be included.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill, choice [REDACTED].\n"
