Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If J is third, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is fourth\n  B: His sixth\n  C: Q is first\n  D: S is second\n  E: Y is fifth\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that J must be earlier than G and that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, G must be placed after J with at least one article in between.\nIf J is third, G cannot be fourth, and there are only seven articles, so G must be placed fifth or sixth.\nThis placement satisfies the condition that G must be earlier than R as well.\nArticle S must be placed before article Y, and article Q can be placed third or later.\nIf we place S second, we can place Q third, and now we have a valid order: J-S-Q-G-[Nutrition]-Y-[Finance].\nThis order satisfies all the conditions, and Y is indeed fifth.\n"
