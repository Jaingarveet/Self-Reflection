Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nGiven that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, and that there are more in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can deduce a ranked order of zones by the number of sales representatives: Zone 1 has the most, Zone 3 is second, and Zone 2 has the least. \n\nWe also know the following pairings: \n- Parra and Quinn \n- Stuckey and Udall \n\nAnd the following conditions: \n- Either Parra or Tiao in Zone 1 \n- Either Tiao or Udall in Zone 2 \n\nIf we place Parra and Quinn in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, this satisfies the given conditions. This means that Tiao must be in Zone 2, which is choice [REDACTED].\n"
