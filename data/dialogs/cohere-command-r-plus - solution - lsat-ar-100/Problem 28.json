The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n[REDACTED]iven the conditions: \n- F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected.\n- [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected.\n- If [REDACTED] is selected, [REDACTED] and R must also be selected.\n- The panel must include at least one of each type of scientist.\n- If more than one botanist is selected, then no more than one zoologist is selected. \n\nWe are provided with four selected scientists: F, L, Q, and R. \n\nF is a botanist, so we already have one botanist on the panel. Q is a zoologist, so we have one zoologist as well. This leaves the chemist position to be filled by either [REDACTED] or L, as [REDACTED] cannot be selected without also selecting [REDACTED] and R, which would result in two zoologists (Q and R) and violate the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the fifth scientist selected must be [REDACTED], as they complete the required trio of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and R, and L does not have any selection restrictions.\n"
