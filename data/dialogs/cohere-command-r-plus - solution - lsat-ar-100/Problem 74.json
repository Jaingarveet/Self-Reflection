The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  B: Jaramillo and Ong\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Ong\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven the constraints, we can deduce the following:\n- Landon must be assigned to Zambia, as stated in the constraints.\n- Ong can be assigned to Venezuela, as it is only stated that Kayne \"cannot be assigned to Yemen\" if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which does not preclude other options.\n- If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne must also be assigned per the constraints.\n- Novetzke cannot be assigned per the constraints, as either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can determine that [REDACTED] are the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships.\n"
