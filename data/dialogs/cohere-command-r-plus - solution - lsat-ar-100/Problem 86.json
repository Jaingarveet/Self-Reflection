Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that bay 4 holds produce, we can determine the following:\n1. Bay 4 (produce) is determined.\n2. Bay 3 or 5 must hold textiles as it is next to produce, but we cannot determine which bay without more information.\n3. Bay 1, 2, or 3 could hold fuel as produce is higher-numbered, but we cannot be certain of the exact bay.\n4. Machinery and livestock could occupy the remaining bays, but their positions are not fixed due to the limited information.\n5. Bay 6 (livestock) is determined as it must be higher-numbered than textiles and produce.\n\nThus, for [REDACTED] bays (1, 4, 5, and 6), the type of cargo they are holding is completely determined.\n"
