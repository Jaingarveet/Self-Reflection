At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe conditions state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, eliminating choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. \n\nThe condition, \"F is placed on the same shelf as M,\" means that F and M must be on the same shelf. As a result, the only option that satisfies this condition is choice [REDACTED], with F, H, and M on the bottom shelf. \n\nThe prompt also states that there must be at least two books on each shelf, and there are no restrictions that would prevent two books from being placed on the bottom shelf. \n\nTherefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.\n"
