        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nThe conditions provided in the question offer a set of constraints that narrow down the possible arrangements of the books on the shelves. \n\nGiven that: \n1. \"O is placed on a higher shelf than L\" \n2. \"F is placed on the same shelf as M\" \n3. \"K is on a higher shelf than F\" \n\nWe can deduce the following: \n\nAs F and M are on the same shelf, they must be considered together as a unit. K, being on a higher shelf than F, eliminates the possibility of K being on the middle shelf, as that would violate the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf (assuming I and F/M are already on the middle shelf). \n\nThis leaves only two options for K: the top or bottom shelf. Placing K on the bottom shelf would also place it below O, which contradicts the condition that O is higher than L (and, by extension, F/M). \n\nTherefore, K must be on the top shelf. This automatically places O on the middle shelf, as O cannot be on the same shelf as I or K (given their respective placements). \n\nWith this arrangement, we can see that O is indeed placed on a higher shelf than M, satisfying the conditions provided.\n"
