Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Upon reviewing my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the given rules to determine the possible assignments of parking spaces to the six employees.\n\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #1.\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu cannot be assigned parking space #3.\nRobertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #2.\n\nSo, the only possible assignment of parking spaces that satisfies all the given rules is:\n\nYoung: #5\nSouza: #4\nTogowa: #2\nRobertson: #1\nVaughn: #3\nXu: #6\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Souza is assigned parking space #4."
