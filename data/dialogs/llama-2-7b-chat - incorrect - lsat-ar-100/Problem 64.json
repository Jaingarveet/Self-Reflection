Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will now use my self-reflection to answer the question correctly.\n\nFrom the given conditions, we can deduce that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, the statement \"C: Parra works in Zone 3\" cannot be true.\n\nWe also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, it means that Parra must work in Zone 1.\n\nNow, we are left with the following options:\n\nA: Kim works in Zone 2. [REDACTED]\nB: Mahr works in Zone 1. [REDACTED]\nC: Parra works in Zone 3. [REDACTED]\nD: Stuckey works in Zone 2. [REDACTED]\nE: Tiao works in Zone 1.
