Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday). This means that the total number of batches made in a week is 3 x 3 = 9.\n\nIf the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can deduce that the total number of batches made in a week is 9 - 1 = 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\nThis is incorrect because, as we know, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday.\n\nB: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\nThis is also incorrect because, as we know, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.\n\nC: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\nThis is incorrect because, as we know, the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.\n\nD: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\nThis is incorrect because, as we know, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.\n\nE: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\nThis is incorrect because, as we know, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday."
