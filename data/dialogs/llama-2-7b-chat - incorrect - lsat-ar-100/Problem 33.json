The correct answer is (E) Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe organizer must select at least five and at most six works from the group of nine works. Since there are three French novels and three Russian novels in the group, the organizer must select at least three French novels and at most four French novels. This means that the organizer can select at most two Russian novels and at most one play. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\n\nI hope this answer is correct, and I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake."
