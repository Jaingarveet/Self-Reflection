The correct answer is (D) Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\n\nHere's how I arrived at my answer:\n\nThe given conditions state that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. So, the first batch of peanut butter cookies being made on Tuesday means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch.\n\nAdditionally, the condition states that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, which means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n\nTherefore, the only option that cannot be true is (C) Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday."
