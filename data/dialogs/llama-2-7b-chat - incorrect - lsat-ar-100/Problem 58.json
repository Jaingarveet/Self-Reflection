Additionally, the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n\nBased on these clues, we can deduce that the bay holding fuel is located in bay 1, the bay holding grain is located in bay 2, the bay holding livestock is located in bay 3, the bay holding produce is located in bay 5, and the bay holding textiles is located in bay 6.\n\nTherefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 cannot be grain (as it is located in bay 2), nor can it be livestock (as it is located in bay 3), nor can it be produce (as it is located in bay 5).\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) Produce."
