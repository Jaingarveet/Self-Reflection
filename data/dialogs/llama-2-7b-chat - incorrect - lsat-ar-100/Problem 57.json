Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. However, the problem states that if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must not give reports on that day.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I need to pay closer attention to the conditions provided in the problem. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George can give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other are Kyle and Nina.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
