Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

After reevaluating the problem, I realized that the correct answer is (B) Irving gives a report on Monday.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The conditions of the problem state that exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n2. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so George will give a report on Tuesday.\n3. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so Olivia will give her report on Monday morning, and Robert will give his report on Tuesday morning.\n4. Since Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination of morning reports is:\n\nMonday: Helen, Irving, and Lenore\nTuesday: George\nWednesday: Nina, Helen, and Irving\n\nSo, the answer is (B) Irving gives a report on Monday."
