Here is my reflection on the problem and my previous solution:\n\nI mistakenly selected option (A) Jiang, Kramer as the correct answer. I overlooked the fact that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, and that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any plays that Jiang reviews.\n\nTo correct my previous answer, I will select option (B) Kramer, O'Neill as the correct answer. This option meets all the conditions given in the problem: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and neither of them reviews any plays that Jiang reviews.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is:\n\nKramer, O'Neill\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer."
