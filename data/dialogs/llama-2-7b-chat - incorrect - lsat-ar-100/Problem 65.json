Let's analyze the problem again:\n\nIf M is the only chemist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist. Since M is a chemist, there must be at least one botanist and one zoologist selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditions given in the problem:\n\n* The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).\n* If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\n* F and K cannot both be selected.\n* K and M cannot both be selected.\n* If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n* If M is the only chemist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one zoologist selected.\n* Since there are only three chemists (K, L, and M), and at least one chemist (M) has been selected, then there are only two chemists left (K and L).\n* Therefore, the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist, and at most one of them can be selected from the remaining botanists (F, G, and H).\n* Since there are only two botanists (F and G) and at most one can be selected, then the other botanist (H) must be a zoologist.\n* Therefore, the panel must include at least one botanist, one zoologist, and one chemist (M).\n\nNow, let's consider the choices:\n\n* A: F and G are both selected. This is not possible since there are only two botanists (F and G), and at most one can be selected.\n* B: G and H are both selected. This is also not possible since H is a zoologist and cannot be selected as a botanist.\n* C: H and P are both selected. This is not possible since H is a zoologist and cannot be selected as a botanist.\n* D: F, G, and H are all selected. This is not possible since there are only three slots for scientists, and at least one of them must be a chemist (M).\n* E: P, Q, and R are all selected. This is not possible since there are only three slots for scientists, and at least one of them must be a chemist (M).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E): P, Q, and R are all selected."
