The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will now use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly.\n\nFrom the given conditions, we can deduce that:\n\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations of plays that Jiang could review:\n\n1. Jiang does not review Tamerlane, so he must review either Sunset or Undulation.\n2. If Jiang reviews Sunset, then Lopez must review Undulation, as neither of them reviews Tamerlane.\n3. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian must review Tamerlane, as neither of them reviews Sunset.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Megregian reviews Tamerlane."
