Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the constraints provided:\n\n1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.\n2. One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row.\n3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\n4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nUsing these constraints, we can eliminate some of the options:\n\nOption A: The optometrist is in space 2.\nThis is not possible because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and the optometrist is not next to the pharmacy.\n\nOption B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\nThis is not possible because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and space 7 is not the end of the row.\n\nOption C: A restaurant is in space 4.\nThis is possible because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and space 4 is between the pharmacy and the veterinarian.\n\nOption D: The shoe store is in space 6.\nThis is not possible because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and the shoe store is next to the toy store.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C: A restaurant is in space 4."
