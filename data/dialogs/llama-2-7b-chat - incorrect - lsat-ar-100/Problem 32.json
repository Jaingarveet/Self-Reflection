Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the given conditions to eliminate the incorrect options.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Image's website target is not 1 day. According to the problem statement, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, which means that Image's website target cannot be 1 day.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Solide's website target is not 2 days. Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's voicemail target, which means that Solide's website target cannot be 2 days.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Solide's voicemail target is not 2 days. As mentioned earlier, Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's voicemail target, which means that Solide's voicemail target cannot be 2 days.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Truvest's website target is not 2 days. According to the problem statement, Truvest's website target must be shorter than Solide's website target, which means that Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days."
