Upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\n\nThe given information can be represented in a diagram as follows:\n\nJiang | Kramer | Lopez | Megregian | O'Neill\nSunset | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗\nTamerlane | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓\nUndulation | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that:\n\n* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any plays that Jiang reviews.\n* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\nThis option is incorrect because Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, and Jiang does not review any plays that Lopez reviews.\n\nB: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nThis option is also incorrect because Megregian does not review any plays that Jiang reviews, and Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez does.\n\nC: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\nThis option is incorrect because O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, which is the same play that Megregian reviews.\n\nD: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nThis option is incorrect because Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez does, and O'Neill does not review any plays that Jiang reviews.\n\nE: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nThis option is incorrect because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E): O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does."
