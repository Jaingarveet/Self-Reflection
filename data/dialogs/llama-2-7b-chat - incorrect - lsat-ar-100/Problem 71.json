Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\n\nProblem:\nThe problem states that there are exactly seven sales representatives working in the three sales zones, and each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones. The conditions given in the problem are: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nSolution:\nI initially thought that the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 could be:\n\nB: Kim, Tiao\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect. The correct answer is:\n\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer can be obtained by applying the conditions given in the problem to the list of sales representatives:\n\n* Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, so either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 3.\n* Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, so either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 3.\n* Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.\n* Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.\n* There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so the complete list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 must include at least one of Stuckey, Tiao, or Udall.\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is:\n\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to accurately answer the question this time."
