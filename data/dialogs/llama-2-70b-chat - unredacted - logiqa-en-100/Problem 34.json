This option is a logical inference from the original sentence because it suggests that if you want something for yourself, you should also be willing to give it to others. This is in line with the idea of treating others the way you would want to be treated.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the original sentence carefully and understand its meaning.\n2. Identify the logical relationship between the original sentence and each option.\n3. Choose the option that logically follows from the original sentence.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the original sentence.\n* Identify the logical relationship between the original sentence and each option.\n* Use the process of elimination to eliminate options that are not logically related to the original sentence.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it logically follows from the original sentence.\n* Remember that the Golden Rule is a principle of treating others as you would want to be treated, not necessarily what they want.\n"

This option logically follows from the original sentence because it suggests that if you want something for yourself, you should also be willing to give it to others. This is in line with the idea of treating others the way you would want to be treated.\n\nThe other options do not logically follow from the original sentence. Option A: Only those who do what they want can do it to others, is an incorrect inference from the original sentence. It suggests that if someone wants to do something, they should be allowed to do it to others, which is not what Confucius meant.\n\nOption C: Don't treat others unless you want to, is also an incorrect inference. It suggests that we should only treat others if we want to, which is not the message of the Golden Rule.\n\nOption D: Whatever is applied to people should be what they want, is also incorrect. It suggests that whatever we do to others should be what they want, which is not always the case. The Golden Rule is about treating others the way we would want to be treated, not necessarily what they want.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: If you want, then give it to others."
