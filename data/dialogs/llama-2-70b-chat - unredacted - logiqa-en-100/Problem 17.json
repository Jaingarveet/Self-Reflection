However, choice A reveals that the running cost of the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is significantly lower than that of the steel armored vehicle, which was not considered in the initial statement. This lower running cost could potentially offset the higher manufacturing cost, making the aluminum alloy armored vehicle a more cost-effective option in the long run. Therefore, choice A raises doubts about the conclusion that it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles with the same protective properties.\n"
