An authoritative person pointed out that if a job seeker with an overseas degree has real knowledge and basic social skills and can accurately position themselves in the career selection process, they will not become a \"sea waiter.\" Therefore, we can conclude that Daejeon either lacks real talent, or basic social skills, or has failed to accurately locate themselves in the career selection process, which leads to their inability to find a job.\n\nOption B states that Daejeon either does not have real talent, or lacks basic social skills, or fails to accurately locate in the career selection process. This is in line with the authoritative person's statement and the fact that Daejeon has not yet found a job. Therefore, option B is the best answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect answer format\n* Failure to state the answer choice correctly\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Read the passage carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the authoritative person's statement and its implications.\n3.

Double-check the answer to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the passage carefully and understand the problem.\n* Pay attention to the authoritative person's statement and its implications.\n* Analyze the given options carefully and determine which one aligns with the passage's information.\n* Use the correct answer format to avoid errors.\n* Double-check the answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
