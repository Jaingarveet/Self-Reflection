Therefore, the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is false.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the false premise leading to the false conclusion.\n2. Recognize that the false premise does not necessarily imply the false conclusion.\n3. Evaluate each premise independently to determine its validity.\n4. Consider alternative explanations for the false conclusion.\nAdvice:\n- Always carefully evaluate the logical relationships between premises and conclusions.\n- Avoid assuming that a false conclusion implies a false premise.\n- Consider alternative explanations for a false conclusion.\n- Evaluate each premise independently to determine its validity.\n"
