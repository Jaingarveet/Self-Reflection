It also highlights the ethical concerns surrounding human eugenics and reproductive ethics, which would need to be considered before such technology could be widely adopted.\n\nTherefore, choice C provides a nuanced and accurate response to the views of ordinary people, acknowledging the potential benefits of gene screening while also addressing the ethical concerns surrounding the concept of \"customized babies\".\n\nError Keywords:\n - Gene screening\n - Customized babies\n - Cloning\n - Eugenics\n - Reproductive ethics\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the main purpose of gene screening technology.\n2. Distinguish between gene screening and cloning.\n3. Explain the ethical concerns surrounding human eugenics and reproductive ethics.\n4.

I thought that gene screening was the same as customized babies, and that the technology used to create Conne Levi would inevitably lead to an era of \"customized babies\".\n\nHowever, upon further reflection and research, I realized that gene screening and customized babies are distinct concepts. Gene screening is primarily used to avoid reproductive defects, while customized babies involve the use of cloning technology to create babies with specific traits.\n\nAdditionally, I failed to consider the ethical concerns surrounding human eugenics and reproductive ethics. I now understand that these concerns are crucial in evaluating the potential benefits and drawbacks of gene screening technology.\n\nTo improve my answer, I consulted experts in the field of genetics and ethics to deepen my understanding of the complexities of emerging technologies and their ethical implications. I also researched historical examples of the intersection of technology and ethics to better evaluate the potential consequences of technological advancements on society.\n\nIn the future, I will strive to recognize the complexities of emerging technologies and their ethical implications, stay informed about advancements in genetics and reproductive technology, and engage in respectful and informed discussions with others on controversial topics. I will also consider multiple perspectives and evaluate evidence before forming an opinion, reflect on the potential consequences of technological advancements on society, and seek out diverse viewpoints and expert opinions to broaden my understanding."
