Therefore, option A is the best answer.\n\nIn addition, option C is not the best answer because the argument's reasons are not necessarily untrue or inconsistent with each other.

Option D is also not the best answer because the argument does not commit a \"mis-problem\" logical error.\n\nTherefore, I have learned to carefully consider the wording of the argument and the available options, and to reflect on my previous answers to improve my accuracy."
