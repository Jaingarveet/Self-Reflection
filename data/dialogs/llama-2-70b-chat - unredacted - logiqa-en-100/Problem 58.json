The data shows that housing prices increased by 7.2% while land prices rose by 0.37%, which suggests that the increase in housing prices may not be solely due to the increase in land prices. This information contradicts the assertion in choice C, which states that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. Therefore, choice B is the most doubtful of the assertion.\n\nChoice A provides data on the increase in housing and land prices in Shanghai, but it does not provide enough information to contradict the assertion. Choice D is a statement from the chairman of Yongtai Development Company, which suggests that high demand for housing is a factor in rising housing prices, but it does not directly address the relationship between land prices and housing prices.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Subjective opinion\n - Lack of objective evidence\n - Insufficient information\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the assertion being made in the question.\n3. Evaluate each choice to determine if it provides objective evidence that contradicts the assertion.\n4. Choose the option that provides the most reliable information that contradicts the assertion.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is in the correct format.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always evaluate each choice carefully and consider all the information provided.\n - Don't rely solely on subjective opinions or beliefs.\n - Look for objective data and evidence to support your answer.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure that it is correct and in the correct format.\n"

I relied solely on my understanding of the problem and did not look for objective data and evidence to support my answer. I realized that I need to double-check my answer to ensure that it is correct and in the correct format.\n\nIn this question, I correctly answered choice B because it provides objective data on the relationship between housing prices and land prices in Beijing, which contradicts the assertion in choice C. I learned that it is important to evaluate each choice carefully and consider all the information provided, and to look for objective data and evidence to support my answer. I also learned that double-checking my answer is crucial to ensure that it is correct and in the correct format.\n\nIn summary, I improved my answer by carefully evaluating each choice, considering all the information provided, and looking for objective data and evidence to support my answer. I also double-checked my answer to ensure that it is correct and in the correct format."
