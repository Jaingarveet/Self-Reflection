As long as I am there! You believe me!\", \"Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years.Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old Behind black athletes, from me, a new chapter will be written! \"\nQuestion: The fact that Liu Xiang won the championship and his words do not constitute a rebuttal to which of the following assertions?\nChoices:\n  A: Only black athletes can become track and field champions.\n  B: All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players.\n  C: Most track and field champions are black athletes.\n  D: If who is the king of sprint, whoever has the African-black descent.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nLiu Xiang's victory and statement actually support the assertion that most track and field champions are black athletes. His statement, \"Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years,\" acknowledges the dominance of black athletes in the sport.
