However, the prompt only states that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, not Quinn.\n**Correct Answer:** D: Tiao\n**Reasoning:**\n* We know Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.\n* We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n* Since Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 with them.\n* Therefore, Tiao must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.\n* However, we also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n* Since Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 and cannot be in Zone 2 with Udall, Tiao must be in Zone 3.\n* Consequently, Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 with Tiao, as they are in the same zone.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
