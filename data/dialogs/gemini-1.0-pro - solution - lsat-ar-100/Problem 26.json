Specifically, I overlooked the condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This condition means that Wayne must perform at least one modern piece before the third solo, which is a traditional piece. Therefore, Wayne must perform at least two solos in total, and at least one of those solos must be a traditional piece.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
