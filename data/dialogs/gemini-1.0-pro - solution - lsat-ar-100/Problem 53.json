I only considered the rule that J must be shown in the evening, and I did not consider the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the rules and the order in which the houses will be shown.\nI will start by considering the rule that J must be shown in the evening. This means that J cannot be shown in the morning or the afternoon.\nNext, I will consider the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that K must be shown in the afternoon or the evening.\nNow, I will consider the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L cannot be shown in the morning.\nBased on these rules, I can create the following table:\n| Time | House |\n|---|---|\n| Morning |  |\n| Afternoon | K, L, M |\n| Evening | J, N, O, P |\nThe only answer choice that is consistent with this table is E: M is shown in the afternoon.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
