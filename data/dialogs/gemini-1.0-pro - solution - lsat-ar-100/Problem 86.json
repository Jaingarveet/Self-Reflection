Specifically, I did not consider the fact that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. This information is important because it means that the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.\nNow, let's consider the information provided in the context step-by-step:\n* The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n* The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n* The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n* The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n* Bay 4 is holding produce.\nBased on this information, we can determine the following:\n* The bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.\n* The bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.\n* The bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.\n* The bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 2.\nTherefore, for exactly four of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
