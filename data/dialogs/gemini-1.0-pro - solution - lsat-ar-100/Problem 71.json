Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

This led me to overlook the fact that only one option satisfies this condition.\n**Key takeaway:** It's crucial to consider all the given information and constraints simultaneously, not just individual pieces, to arrive at the correct answer.\n## Applying the Lesson to the Current Question\nLet's analyze each option:\n* **A: Kim, Mahr:** This violates the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.\n* **B: Kim, Tiao:** This violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n* **C: Parra, Quinn:** This violates the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n* **D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall:** This satisfies all the conditions:\n    * Parra and Quinn are in the same zone (Zone 1).\n    * Either Parra or Tiao (Tiao) is in Zone 1.\n    * Either Tiao or Udall (Udall) is in Zone 2.\n    * Stuckey and Udall are in the same zone (Zone 3).\n    * There are more representatives in Zone 3 (3) than in Zone 2 (1).\n* **E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall:** This violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\nTherefore, only option D satisfies all the conditions and constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
