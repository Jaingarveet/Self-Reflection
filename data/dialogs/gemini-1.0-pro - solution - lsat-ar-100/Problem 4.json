Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLan cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day as [REDACTED].\nIf Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she could lead a Thursday or Friday session, or she could still lead a Wednesday session.\nIf Lan leads a Thursday session, then [REDACTED] cannot lead a Thursday session.\nIf Lan leads a Friday session, then [REDACTED] can lead a Thursday session.\nIf Lan leads a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] can lead a Thursday session.\nTherefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then we cannot determine which lab assistant must lead a Thursday session.\n"
