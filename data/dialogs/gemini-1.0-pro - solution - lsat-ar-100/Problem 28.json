The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Identify the scientists who are already selected: F, L, Q, and R.\n2. Verify that at least one scientist of each type is selected: F (botanist), L (chemist), and Q (zoologist).\n3. Apply the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since only one botanist (F) is selected, we can select another zoologist.\n4. Apply the condition that F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected. [REDACTED] is not selected.\n5. Apply the condition that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected. [REDACTED] is not selected.\n6. Apply the condition that if [REDACTED] is selected, both [REDACTED] and R must be selected. Since [REDACTED] is not selected, [REDACTED] and R are not selected.\n7. Identify the remaining scientists: [REDACTED] (botanist), [REDACTED] (chemist), and [REDACTED] (zoologist).\n8. Choose the scientist who satisfies the remaining conditions: [REDACTED] (zoologist).\n"
