Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?\nChoices:\n  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle\n  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\n  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially chose the wrong answer because I did not carefully consider the condition about Nina's report.\n* **Lesson learned:** I need to pay close attention to all the conditions and rules provided in the question.\n* **Improved approach:** I will systematically analyze the conditions and rules to eliminate answer choices that violate them.\n**Analysis:**\n* **Condition 1:** George can only give a report on Tuesday.\n* **Condition 2:** Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.\n* **Condition 3:** If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.\n**Analysis of answer choices:**\n* **Choice A:** This violates Condition 2 because Olivia gives an afternoon report on Tuesday.\n* **Choice B:** This violates Condition 3 because Nina gives a report on Wednesday, but Helen and Irving do not give reports on Thursday.\n* **Choice C:** This violates Condition 1 because George gives a report on Monday.\n* **Choice D:** This satisfies all the conditions. Nina gives a report on Monday, so Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert do not give afternoon reports. George gives a report on Tuesday.\n* **Choice E:** This violates Condition 2 because Robert gives an afternoon report on Tuesday.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct answer is **D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
