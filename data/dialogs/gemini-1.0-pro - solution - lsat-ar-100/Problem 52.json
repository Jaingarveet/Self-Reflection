        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**My previous incorrect answer:** C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n**Reasoning behind my incorrect answer:** I incorrectly assumed that since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, then Franco and Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. However, this assumption did not consider the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n**Correct answer:** B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n**Reasoning behind the correct answer:**\n1. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n2. Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n3. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n4. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nBased on these conditions, the only possible schedule that satisfies all of them is:\n* Monday: Garcia\n* Tuesday: Franco, Hong\n* Wednesday: Iturbe, Jackson\nTherefore, Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday.\n**Lessons learned:**\n* Carefully consider all the given conditions and constraints before making assumptions.\n* Double-check the answer against all the conditions to ensure it satisfies all of them.\n* Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions that might lead to incorrect conclusions.\n**Applying the lessons learned to the current question:**\nFollowing the lessons learned, I will carefully analyze the given conditions and constraints to determine the correct answer.\n**Analysis of the current question:**\nThe question asks which of the following must be true if Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. We already know from the previous analysis that if Jackson testifies on Wednesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday. Therefore, the correct answer must be related to Garcia's testimony.\n**Evaluation of the answer choices:**\n* A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday. This statement is not necessarily true. While Franco could be scheduled on Monday, it is not a requirement based on the given information.\n* B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. This statement is true, as we have already established.\n* C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday. This statement is not necessarily true. While only one witness (Garcia) is required to testify on Monday, it is possible for another witness (e.g., Hong) to also testify on Monday.\n* D: Exactly two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. This statement is not necessarily true. As mentioned above, only one witness is required on Monday, and it is possible for another witness to join them.\n* E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong. This statement is not necessarily true. While Garcia and Hong could potentially testify on the same day (Tuesday), it is not a requirement based on the given information.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true if Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday is that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
