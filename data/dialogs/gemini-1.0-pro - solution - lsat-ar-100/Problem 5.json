I only considered the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I did not consider the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions. I need to consider the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I also need to consider the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\nI also need to consider the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This condition tells me that O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.\nI also need to consider the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M. This condition tells me that F and M cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.\nBased on all of these conditions, I can conclude that the following must be true:\n* K is placed on the top shelf.\n* F and M are placed on the middle shelf.\n* I is placed on the bottom shelf.\n* O is placed on the top shelf.\n* L is placed on the middle shelf.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is **A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.**"
