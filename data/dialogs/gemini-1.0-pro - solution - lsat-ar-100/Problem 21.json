The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

Specifically, I did not consider the constraint that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the constraints and then use a process of elimination to determine which of the answer choices is possible.\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n1. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means that Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia.\n2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Zambia, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to the other country.\n3. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. This means that if Landon is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela or Yemen, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to the other country.\n4. Using the process of elimination, we can determine that the only answer choice that is possible is C: Kayne and Landon.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
