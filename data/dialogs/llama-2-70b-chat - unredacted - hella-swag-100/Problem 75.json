This answer choice aligns with the overall message of the text, which is to prioritize one's own well-being and not be controlled by the opinions of others. By acting as if one doesn't need the money, they can break free from the pressure of meeting expectations and focus on their own goals and aspirations.\n\nThe other answer choices do not align with the main idea of the text. Option B suggests stopping caring about what others say, but this is a short-term solution that may not address the root of the problem. Option C suggests looking back on the future, but this does not address the issue of pressure employment. Option D suggests giving notice to someone who deserves it, but this is not a solution to the problem of extreme pressure employment.\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by focusing on short-term relief rather than a long-term solution. By re-reading the text and identifying the main idea, I realized that option A best aligns with the overall message of prioritizing one's own well-being and not being controlled by the opinions of others. I learned the importance of considering both short-term and long-term solutions and re-evaluating my answer if necessary."
