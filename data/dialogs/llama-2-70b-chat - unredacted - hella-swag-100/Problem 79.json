Read the sentence carefully and understand the context.\n2. Consider all possible meanings of the phrase \"a closing image.\"\n3. Evaluate each choice and determine which one best completes the sentence.\n4. Choose the answer that best completes the sentence.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the sentence carefully and understand the context.\n- Consider all possible meanings of a phrase or word.\n- Evaluate each choice and determine which one best completes the sentence.\n- Don't jump to conclusions based on a single phrase or word.\n- Consider the entire sentence and its context before making a decision.\n"
