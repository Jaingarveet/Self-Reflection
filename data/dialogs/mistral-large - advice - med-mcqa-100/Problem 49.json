In the case of blood, the pH is around 7.4, and the pKa of the bicarbonate buffer system is 6.1. However, the bicarbonate buffer system is still an effective buffer in blood because it exists in high concentrations and because it is an open system, meaning that carbon dioxide can be exhaled to maintain the pH balance.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
