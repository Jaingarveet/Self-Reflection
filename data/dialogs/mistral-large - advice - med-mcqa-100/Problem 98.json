The X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is a characteristic \"string sign\" or \"double-track sign\" seen on an upper GI series. However, this is not an option in the given choices.\n\nThe \"single bubble appearance\" is a feature of duodenal atresia, not pyloric stenosis. The \"double bubble appearance\" is a feature of duodenal atresia or stenosis, not pyloric stenosis. The \"triple bubble appearance\" is a feature of jejunal atresia, not pyloric stenosis. The \"multiple air fluid levels\" are a feature of small bowel obstruction, not pyloric stenosis.\n\nSince none of the given choices is the correct X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis, I need to select the best possible answer based on the available options. The \"double bubble appearance\" can be seen in some cases of pyloric stenosis, although it is not the classic finding. Therefore, I will select \"B\" as the best possible answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
