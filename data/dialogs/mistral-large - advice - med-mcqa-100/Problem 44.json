It consists of five factors: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, cervical position, cervical consistency, and fetal station. Each factor is scored from 0 to 3, with a maximum total score of 13.\n\n* Cervical dilation: 3 cm (score 2)\n* Cervical effacement: < 0.5 cm (score 3)\n* Cervical position: anterior (score 2)\n* Cervical consistency: slightly soft (score 1)\n* Fetal station: -1 (score 1)\n\nTotal Bishop score: 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
