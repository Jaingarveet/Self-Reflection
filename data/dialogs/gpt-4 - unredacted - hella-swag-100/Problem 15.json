The glasses are stirred with a stirring rod. the glasses\nChoices:\n  A: are seen set on the table and are slowly panned over from right to left.\n  B: are filled with ice and poured afterwards.\n  C: are filled with lemonade, vegetables and honey mustard.\n  D: are taken off the counter and poured into wooden bowls using a sharp knife.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I assumed the next step in the process of making lemonade, rather than considering the context of the question. The question was asking for the most likely completion to the text, not necessarily the next step in making lemonade.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Contextual error\n- Comprehension error\nSolution:\nThe question is asking for the most likely completion to the text. The text describes a process of making a drink with lemons, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's about making lemonade. The most logical completion to the text, given the options, is that the glasses are seen set on the table and are slowly panned over from right to left (Option A).\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.\n2. Consider the context of the question.\n3. Don't make assumptions based on your own knowledge or experience.\n4. Evaluate each option and choose the one that makes the most sense in the context of the question.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.\n- Consider the context of the question before making assumptions.\n- Evaluate each option carefully and choose the one that makes the most sense in the context of the question.\n- Don't let your own knowledge or experience cloud your judgement.\n"
