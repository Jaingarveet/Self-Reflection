Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I assumed the next step in the process of making lemonade, rather than considering the context of the question. The question was asking for the most likely completion to the text, not necessarily the next step in making lemonade.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Contextual error\n- Comprehension error\nSolution:\nThe question is asking for the most likely completion to the text. The text describes a process of making a drink with lemons, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's about making lemonade. The most logical completion to the text, given the options, is that the glasses are seen set on the table and are slowly panned over from right to left (Option A).\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.\n2. Consider the context of the question.\n3. Don't make assumptions based on your own knowledge or experience.\n4. Evaluate each option and choose the one that makes the most sense in the context of the question.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.\n- Consider the context of the question before making assumptions.\n- Evaluate each option carefully and choose the one that makes the most sense in the context of the question.\n- Don't let your own knowledge or experience cloud your judgement."
