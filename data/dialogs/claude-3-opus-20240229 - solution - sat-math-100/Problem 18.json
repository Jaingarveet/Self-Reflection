Let me think through it again step-by-step:\n1) $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ can be rewritten as $(9^{\\frac{1}{4}})^3$ using the property of exponents $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$\n2) $9^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt[4]{9}$, which is the fourth root of 9\n3) $\\sqrt[4]{9} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{3}$  (since the square root of 9 is 3, and the square root of 3 is $\\sqrt{3}$)\n4) Therefore, $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (\\sqrt{3})^3$\n5) $(\\sqrt{3})^3 = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3}$\nSo the correct answer is D: $3\\sqrt{3}$\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
