Looking at the snack mix:\n   - It contains multiple distinct substances: peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, chocolate pieces\n   - These substances are physically mixed together but not chemically combined\n   - You could still pick out the individual peanuts, raisins, etc. Each component keeps its original properties.\n3. Reviewing the choices:\n   A) Correct. A mixture is made up of more than one substance.\n   B) Incorrect. The substances in a mixture can be separated. \n   C) Correct. In a mixture, components retain their original properties.\n   D) Incorrect. In a mixture, components are not chemically combined.\nBoth A and C are true statements about mixtures. But A most directly answers the question of why this snack is a mixture.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
