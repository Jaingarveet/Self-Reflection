        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The density of red-clay bricks is 2000 kg/m^3. This means that 1 m^3 of bricks has a mass of 2000 kg.\n   - 2 m^3 of bricks would have a mass of 2 * 2000 = 4000 kg\n   - 4 m^3 of bricks would have a mass of 4 * 2000 = 8000 kg\n2. The density of air is 1 kg/m^3. This means that 1 m^3 of air has a mass of 1 kg. \n   - 6000 m^3 of air would have a mass of 6000 * 1 = 6000 kg\n   - 10,000 m^3 of air would have a mass of 10,000 * 1 = 10,000 kg\n3. Comparing the masses:\n   - 2 m^3 of bricks: 4000 kg\n   - 4 m^3 of bricks: 8000 kg \n   - 6000 m^3 of air: 6000 kg\n   - 10,000 m^3 of air: 10,000 kg\n4. The lowest mass is 2 m^3 of bricks at 4000 kg.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
