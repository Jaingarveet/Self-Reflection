If J participates, then G must participate.\n4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.\nLet's analyze the choices:\nA: F and H - If F participates, E cannot. This leaves us with two more spots. H can be one of them, but the last spot cannot be filled because if we choose J, we must also choose G, and if we choose K, M cannot participate because F is already participating. So, this choice is not possible.\nB: G and J - If G and J participate, E or F can participate, but not both. If E participates, the last spot can be filled by K. If F participates, the last spot cannot be filled by M because F is already participating. So, this choice is possible.\nC: G and M - If G and M participate, F must also participate because M is participating. This leaves us with one more spot. This spot can be filled by either J or K, but not both. If J is chosen, it contradicts the condition that if J participates, then G must participate. So, this choice is not possible.\nD: H and M - If H and M participate, F must also participate because M is participating. This leaves us with one more spot. This spot can be filled by either J or K, but not both. If J is chosen, it contradicts the condition that if J participates, then G must participate. So, this choice is not possible.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
