The word \"except\" indicates that you are looking for the statement that does not fit with the others.\n- Use logical reasoning to evaluate each statement and determine whether it supports or challenges the opinion.\n- Be aware of your own biases and do not let them influence your interpretation of the statements.\n"

The question asks which statement, if true, would not question this opinion. \nA: This statement suggests that the grassland has degraded over time, which could be due to human factors, not just climate drought. This questions the opinion.\nB: This statement suggests that grasslands in a similar climate are not degraded, which could imply that human factors, not climate drought, are responsible for the degradation. This questions the opinion.\nC: This statement suggests that in areas without human interference, the grassland has not degraded, implying that human factors, not climate drought, may be responsible for the degradation. This questions the opinion.\nD: This statement directly states that human factors are the main cause of the increase in dust storms, which directly questions the opinion.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
