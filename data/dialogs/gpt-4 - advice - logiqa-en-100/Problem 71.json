The correct answer should explain this contradiction. \nOption A does not explain why people would not hire college students as nannies. \nOption B suggests that people might not be willing to pay a fair wage for a college student nanny, but it does not explain why they would not hire them at all. \nOption C suggests that people believe housekeeping work is good for college students, but it does not explain why they would not hire them. \nOption D suggests that those who disapprove of college students being nannies believe students should choose a field related to their major. This could explain why they would not hire them, but it does not explain the contradiction since it only addresses the views of those who do not approve of college students being nannies.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
