Therefore, any information that contradicts this theory or provides an alternative explanation for the decline would raise doubts about the expert's opinion. \nOption A: This option suggests that the local herders are becoming more aware of the need to protect the salamanders, which could mean they are taking steps to prevent their cattle and sheep from trampling the salamanders. However, it does not directly contradict the expert's opinion.\nOption B: This option provides an alternative explanation for the decline in the salamander population. If the salamanders' water source environment is being affected by decreased rainfall and falling groundwater levels, this could be contributing to their decline, regardless of whether they are being trampled by cattle and sheep.\nOption C: This option directly contradicts the expert's opinion by suggesting that the salamanders are able to avoid being trampled by hiding under rocks during the day.\nOption D: This option suggests that the salamanders' habitat is inaccessible to most tourists, but it does not directly relate to the expert's opinion about the impact of cattle and sheep.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
