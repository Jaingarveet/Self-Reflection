This means that if E is selected, there will be at least 3 people selected, which contradicts condition 3 that a maximum of 2 people are selected. Therefore, E cannot be selected.\nFrom condition 1, at least one person of Bingding is selected. This means that either Bing or Ding is selected. \nSince a maximum of 2 people are selected, and at least one person of Bingding is selected, the other person selected cannot be A, B, or E (since selecting A or B would require E to be selected, and E cannot be selected). Therefore, the other person selected must be C.\nTherefore, the fourth person cannot be A, B, E, or C. The only remaining choice is Ding.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
