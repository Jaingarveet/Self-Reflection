Any statement that contradicts this necessity or provides an alternative solution can raise doubts about the expert's point of view. \nOption A supports the expert's view by highlighting the problem caused by the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge. \nOption B suggests that the majority of international ships do not need to pass the Nanjing Bridge, which could raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge. \nOption C suggests that there are other bridges with the same height issue, implying that demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge alone would not solve the problem. \nOption D suggests that there are ships designed to adapt to the passage of the Yangtze River, which could raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge. \nAmong these, option D raises the most doubts as it suggests a technological solution that does not require the demolition and rebuilding of the bridge.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
