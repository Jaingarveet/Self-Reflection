Identify the variables in the statement and their relationships.\n2. Consider the broader implications of the statement on the country.\n3. Evaluate the overall impact of the situation on the country.\n4. Choose the answer that reflects the overall impact of the situation on the country.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always consider the broader implications of the statement.\n - Always evaluate the overall impact of the situation on the country.\n - Never focus solely on specific details without considering the overall impact.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure it reflects the overall impact of the situation on the country.\n"
