If capelin is the main food for both seals and crocodiles, then an increase in the number of seals could have led to a decrease in the availability of capelin, which could have caused the decline of crocodiles.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument and the conclusion that needs to be weakened.\n2. Consider alternative explanations for the conclusion that is unrelated to the argument.\n3. Consider indirect causation that could link the argument to the conclusion.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice to determine if it provides an alternative explanation or indirect causation that weakens the argument.\n5. Choose the answer that most effectively weakens the argument.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always consider alternative explanations and indirect causation.\n - Always evaluate each answer choice carefully and consider how it relates to the argument and the conclusion.\n - Never focus solely on one aspect of the problem; consider all possibilities.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n"
