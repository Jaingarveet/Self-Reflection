Read the statement carefully and understand its meaning.\n2. Identify the logical implications of the statement.\n3. Evaluate each option to determine if it is a logical inference from the statement.\n4. Eliminate options that are not logical inferences.\n5. Choose the answer that is not a logical inference.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical inferences must be based on the meaning of the statement, not on personal interpretations or assumptions.\n"
