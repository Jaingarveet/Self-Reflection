However, this substitution is not logically valid because the two statements are not equivalent.\n\nThe first statement \"money is like dung\" is a metaphorical comparison, while the second statement \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\" is a literal valuation. The two statements are not logically related, and therefore, the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not logically derived.\n\nHowever, if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. Therefore, the answer is \"[REDACTED]\".\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the logical relationship between the two statements.\n2. Determine whether the two statements are equivalent or not.\n3. Determine whether the conclusion is logically derived from the two statements.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice based on the logical relationship between the two statements.\n5. Choose the answer that correctly reflects the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the logical relationship between statements.\n - Always evaluate the logical validity of any conclusions drawn from statements.\n - Never assume that statements are equivalent without evaluating their logical relationship.\n - Always double-check your logical reasoning and final answer.\n"
