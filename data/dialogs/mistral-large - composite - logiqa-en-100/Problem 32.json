I thought it meant to directly infer from the given statement, but it actually means to logically deduce from the given statement.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the word \"derive\"\n* Incorrect interpretation of the question\n* Lack of logical deduction\n\nSolution:\nThe statement \"[REDACTED]\" cannot be derived from the context because it is not mentioned that being careful means having no taste.\nThe statement \"[REDACTED]\" cannot be derived from the context because it is not mentioned that being overbearing means being immoral.\nThe statement \"[REDACTED]\" can be derived from the context because it is mentioned that if humans plunder nature, there will be no sustainable life.\nThe statement \"[REDACTED]\" cannot be derived from the context because it is not mentioned that being immoral means being overbearing and careful. However, it can be logically deduced that if a person is immoral, he may be overbearing and not careful, but it is not necessarily true that he is both.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the meaning of the keywords used in the question.\n2. Identify the statements that can be directly inferred from the given context.\n3. Identify the statements that cannot be directly inferred from the given context.\n4. Use logical deduction to determine if any of the statements that cannot be directly inferred can be logically deduced from the given context.\n5. Choose the answer that cannot be logically deduced from the given context.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the meaning of the keywords used in the question.\n* Do not assume that a statement is true or false based on your personal beliefs or opinions.\n* Use logical deduction to determine if a statement can be derived from the given context.\n* Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is logically consistent with the given context.\n* Remember that the correct answer may not be directly stated in the given context, but may be logically deduced from it.\n"
