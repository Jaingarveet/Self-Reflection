Identify the inconsistency presented in the question.\n2. Read each option carefully and consider how it addresses the inconsistency.\n3. Eliminate options that do not directly address the inconsistency.\n4. Choose the option that best explains the inconsistency.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it addresses the inconsistency.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the inconsistency presented in the question.\n - Always read each option carefully and consider how it addresses the inconsistency.\n - Always eliminate options that do not directly address the inconsistency.\n - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it addresses the inconsistency.\n - Remember that the correct answer should directly address the inconsistency presented in the question.\n"
