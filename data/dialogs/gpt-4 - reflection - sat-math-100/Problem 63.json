Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?\nChoices:\n  A: $300=30 w-60$\n  B: $300=30 w$\n  C: $300=30 w+60$\n  D: $300=60 w-30$\n\nThought: \nThe initial payment of $60 is subtracted from the total price of $300, leaving $240 to be paid in weekly installments of $30. So, the equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, would be $240 = 30w.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I subtracted the initial payment from the total price before setting up the equation. This led me to choose an incorrect equation. The correct approach is to include the initial payment in the equation.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of problem\n- Incorrect equation setup\n- Arithmetic error\nSolution:\nThe total price of the television is $300. This includes an initial payment of $60 and the remaining amount to be paid in weekly installments of $30. Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, is $300 = 60 + 30w.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the total price of the item.\n2. Identify the initial payment.\n3. Identify the amount of the weekly payments.\n4. Set up an equation where the total price is equal to the initial payment plus the product of the weekly payment and the number of weeks.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your equation.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- When setting up equations, consider all components of the problem.\n- Be careful with arithmetic operations; ensure you are adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing as appropriate.\n- Double-check your equation before choosing an answer."
