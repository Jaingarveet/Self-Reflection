This day cannot be Monday, as no two batches of the same kind can be made on the same day, and it cannot be Wednesday or later in the week, as there must be a day between the first and second batches of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies and first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.\n- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, as there must be a day between each batch.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: oatmeal on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday; peanut butter on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday; and sugar on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
