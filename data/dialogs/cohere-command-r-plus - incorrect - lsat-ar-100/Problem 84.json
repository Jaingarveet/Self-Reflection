This rules out Choice A.\n\nWe also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, and that O is on a higher shelf than L. This means that K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, eliminating Choices C and D.\n\nChoice E can be eliminated as it includes four books on the bottom shelf, which contradicts the given conditions stating that there must be at 'least two books' and that there are 'more books' on the bottom shelf than the top shelf (indicating a maximum of three books).\n\nTherefore, Choice B is the only remaining option and must be the correct answer.\n\nThe bottom shelf could include books F, H, and M, with arrangements for the other books still flexible based on the provided conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
