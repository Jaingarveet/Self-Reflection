So, book F is on the top shelf.\n- Book K must be on a higher shelf than book F, so it is either on the middle or bottom shelf.\n- Book O must be on a higher shelf than book L, so it could be on the middle or bottom shelf.\n\nTherefore, statement A is true: O is placed on a higher shelf than M. This is because book M is on the same shelf as book F, which is on a lower shelf than book O.\n\nStatement B may or may not be true, depending on where book G is placed. We don't have enough information to determine the relative positions of books G and K.\n\nStatement C is false because book I is on the middle shelf, and we don't know the position of book C relative to book F.\n\nStatement D is false because we don't know the positions of books G and O relative to each other.\n\nStatement E is true because book F is on the top shelf, and book L cannot be on the middle or top shelves as it is lower than book O.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A and E.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A,E\")"
