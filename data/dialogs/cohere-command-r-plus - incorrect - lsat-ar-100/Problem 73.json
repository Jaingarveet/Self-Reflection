The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

One pair must be of two students and the other a single student.\n\nKramer and O'Neill are a pair as they both review Tamerlane. As Lopez and Megregian do not review any plays that Jiang reviews, they must be a pair. This means that Lopez and Megregian are also a pair and, as such, cannot be part of the pair composed of two students that review Undulation. Therefore, Jiang, Kramer, and O'Neill must be the three students that review Undulation.\n\nWith this information, we can now answer the question:\n- A: Megregian does not review Undulation. - This could be true.\n- B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. - This couldn't be true as O'Neill is one of the three students that review Undulation.\n- C: Jiang reviews Undulation. - This could be true.\n- D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. - This couldn't be true as Lopez and Megregian are a pair and Megregian doesn't review Tamerlane.\n- E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. - As there are no restrictions on what play O'Neill reviews other than Tamerlane, this could be true.\n\nSo, the correct answers are A, C, and E.\nAction: Answer(\"A,C,E\")"
