This means Rottweilers can only be featured on days 2, 3, or 4, as Himalayans are featured on three days and must appear on days 1, 5, 6, or 7 to meet the other conditions. \n\nWorking through the options, we can see that only one answer features the correct sequence of kitten breeds, with at least one day between each appearance of the Himalayan breed and no repetition across the seven days. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Siamese, Himalayan.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
