At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

This means that O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf, as that would leave no room for the other books above it. Therefore, the bottom shelf can only be comprised of a combination of F, G, H, I, K, and M.\n\nWe know that I is on the middle shelf and that K is on a higher shelf than F. This means that F, G, H, and M cannot all be placed on the bottom shelf together, as that would leave no room for K to be placed above F. Therefore, F and M must be placed on the bottom shelf together, which is choice C.\n\nAnswer: C"
