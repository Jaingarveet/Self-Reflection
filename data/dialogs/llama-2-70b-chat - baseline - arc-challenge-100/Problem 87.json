The formation of new tectonic plates is also unrelated to magnetic field reversals. The direction of Earth's rotation on its axis may be affected, but this is not the best answer. The alignment of minerals in newly formed crust would be affected, as they would be oriented towards the new magnetic poles.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
