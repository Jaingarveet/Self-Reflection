The correct interpretation is that $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (9^{\\frac{1}{4}})^3$, as per the rules of exponents.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding of exponent properties\n - Incorrect order of operations with exponents\n - Misinterpretation of fractional exponents\nSolution:\n$9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ can be rewritten as $(9^{\\frac{1}{4}})^3$ according to the properties of exponents.\n$9^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt[4]{9} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{3}$ \nTherefore, $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (\\sqrt{3})^3 = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3}$\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the base number and the exponent.\n2. If the exponent is a fraction, rewrite the expression according to the properties of exponents: $(a^{\\frac{m}{n}}) = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\\frac{1}{n}})^m$.\n3.

Simplify the resulting expression if possible.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your simplified expression.\nAdvice:\n - Always keep the properties of exponents in mind, especially when dealing with fractional exponents.\n - Remember that $a^{\\frac{m}{n}} = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\\frac{1}{n}})^m$, not $(a^m)^{\\frac{1}{n}}$.\n - Always simplify expressions step by step, following the correct order of operations.\n - If you're unsure about a property or rule, take a moment to verify it before proceeding.\n - Double-check your work to catch any errors in your calculations or reasoning."
