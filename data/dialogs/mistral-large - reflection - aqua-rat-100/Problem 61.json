Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?\nChoices:\n  A: 180\n  B: 90\n  C: 270\n  D: 360\n  E: None of the above\n\nThought:\nLet's denote the distance between A and B as \"d\".\n\nFirst, we know that Kevin was still 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour to cover the remaining 70 miles to reach B. Therefore, the total time he spent driving from A to B was 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours.\n\nThe time it took him to drive from A to B is equal to the distance between A and B divided by his speed:\n\nd / 70 = 4\n\nSolving for d, we get:\n\nd = 70 \\* 4 = 280 miles\n\nSince he drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to drive back is equal to the distance between A and B divided by his speed:\n\n280 / 90 = 3.11 hours (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nThe total time he spent driving is equal to the time it took him to drive from A to B plus the time it took him to drive back to A:\n\n4 hours + 3.11 hours = 7.11 hours\n\nHowever, we know that the total time he spent driving was 3 hours less than twice the time it took him to drive from A to B:\n\n2 \\* 4 - 3 = 5 hours\n\nThis contradicts our previous calculation of 7.11 hours. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given choices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") (None of the above)\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour to cover the remaining 70 miles to reach B.
