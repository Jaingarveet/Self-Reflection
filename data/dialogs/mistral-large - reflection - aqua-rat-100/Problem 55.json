I correctly identified the speed of the current as 2 kmph, but when calculating the man's rate along the current, I added the speed of the current to the man's speed against the current instead of his speed in still water.\n\n2. Error Keywords:\n   - Calculation error\n   - Addition error\n   - Misinterpretation of given information\n\n3. Correct Solution:\nThe man's rate in still water is 4 kmph.\nHis rate against the current is 2 kmph, which means the current is reducing his speed by 2 kmph.\nTherefore, the speed of the current is 4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph.\nThe man's rate along the current would be his speed in still water plus the speed of the current, which is 4 kmph + 2 kmph = 6 kmph.\n\n4. Instructions for Future Reference:\n   - Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n   - Identify the given information and what needs to be calculated.\n   - Break down the problem into simpler steps.\n   - Perform calculations accurately and double-check them.\n   - Ensure that the calculated answer corresponds to the correct choice in the multiple-choice options.\n\n5.
