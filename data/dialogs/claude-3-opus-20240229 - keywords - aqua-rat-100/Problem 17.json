        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time:\n1) The company produces 420 components per month. Over a year that is:\n   420 * 12 = 5040 components per year\n2) The production cost is $110 per component. So the total yearly production cost is: \n   5040 * $110 = $554,400\n3) They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. \n   Profit = Revenue - Costs\n   So the total revenue must be at least:\n   $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800\n   \n4) To get the minimum price per component, divide the total revenue by the number of components:\n   $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234.29 per component\n5) Rounding up to the nearest $10 to ensure the profit target is met, the minimum price is $240 per component.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
