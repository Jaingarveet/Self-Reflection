        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) There are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets is:\n   x * (1/2) inches\n2) There are x-1 spaces between the pickets, since the number of spaces is one less than the number of pickets. Each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is:\n   (x-1) * 6 inches\n3) The total length of the fence is the sum of the width of the pickets and the width of the spaces:\n   Total length = x * (1/2) + (x-1) * 6 inches\n                = (1/2)x + 6x - 6 inches\n                = (13/2)x - 6 inches\n4) We need to convert this to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide by 12:\n   ((13/2)x - 6) / 12 feet\n   = (13x - 12) / 24 feet\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24 feet.\nThe key points I missed before were:\n1) Correctly counting the number of spaces as x-1, not x\n2) Properly combining the width of the pickets and spaces\n3) Converting from inches to feet at the end\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
