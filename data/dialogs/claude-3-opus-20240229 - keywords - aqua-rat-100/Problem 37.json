Let's define some variables:\n   - Let n be the number of matches played before the final\n   - Let x be Sachin's total runs before the final\n2. We know Sachin's batting average before the final is 51. Batting average is total runs divided by number of matches. So:\n   51 = x/n\n3. After the final, his batting average is 54. He scored 78 runs in the final. So now:\n   54 = (x + 78)/(n + 1)\n4. We can solve this system of equations for n. First, from the first equation:\n   x = 51n\n5. Substituting this into the second equation:\n   54 = (51n + 78)/(n + 1)\n6. Multiply both sides by (n+1):\n   54(n+1) = 51n + 78\n7. Expand the left side:\n   54n + 54 = 51n + 78\n8. Subtract 51n from both sides:\n   3n + 54 = 78\n9. Subtract 54 from both sides:\n   3n = 24\n10. Divide both sides by 3:\n    n = 8\nTherefore, the number of matches played by Sachin before the final is 8. Adding the final match makes the total number of matches 9.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
