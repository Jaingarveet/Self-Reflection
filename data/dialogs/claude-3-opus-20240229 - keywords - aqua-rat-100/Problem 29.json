So in 29 days, the frog will have climbed 29m and be 1m short of the top.\nOn the 30th day, the frog jumps 3m, which takes it out of the 30m well. It doesn't need to climb the full 3m on the last day.\nThis is a classic \"fencepost error\" - I was counting the number of 1m segments but not considering that the frog doesn't need to traverse a full segment on the final day to get out. It's similar to how a fence with 10 sections only needs 11 posts, not 12.\nCorrecting for this fencepost error, the frog will take 30 days to exit the well.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
