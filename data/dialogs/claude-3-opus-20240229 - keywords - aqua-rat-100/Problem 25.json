        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the first instance be x.\n2) Then, tan(45°) = h/x. We know tan(45°) = 1, so h = x.\n3) After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation is 60°. Let the distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes be d. \n   Then, tan(60°) = h/(x-d). We know tan(60°) = √3, so √3 = h/(x-d).\n4) Substituting h = x from step 2:\n   √3 = x/(x-d)\n   √3(x-d) = x\n   √3x - √3d = x\n   √3x - x = √3d\n   x(√3 - 1) = √3d\n   \n5) Solving for d:\n   d = x(√3 - 1)/√3 \n     = x(√3/√3 - 1/√3)\n     = x(1 - 1/√3)\n     \n6) Now, if the speed of the car is v, then x = 10v (since the car traveled distance x in 10 minutes).\n7) The remaining distance to the tower is x - d. At speed v, this will take time (x - d)/v.\n8) Substituting x = 10v and the expression for d from step 5:\n   Time = (10v - 10v(1 - 1/√3))/v\n        = 10 - 10(1 - 1/√3)\n        = 10 - 10 + 10/√3\n        = 10/√3\n        \n9) Simplifying:\n   Time = 10/√3 * √3/√3\n        = 10√3/3\n        = 10√3/3 * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)\n        = (10√3(√3 + 1))/(3(√3 + 1))\n        = (10(3 + √3))/(3(√3 + 1))\n        = (10/3) * (3 + √3)/(√3 + 1)\n        = (10/3) * (√3 + 1)\n        \nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in (10/3) * (√3 + 1) minutes more.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
