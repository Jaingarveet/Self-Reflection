        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The word \"PROBLEC\" has 7 letters total.\n2. There is one repeated letter - \"P\" appears twice. The other letters (\"R\", \"O\", \"B\", \"L\", \"E\", \"C\") appear once each.\n3. If all the letters were distinct, there would be 7! ways to arrange them. However, since \"P\" is repeated, some of those arrangements are equivalent.\n4. The number of permutations of n objects, where there are n1 objects of one kind, n2 objects of another kind, etc., is given by:\n   n! / (n1! * n2! * ...)\n5. In this case, n = 7 (total letters), n1 = 2 (number of \"P\"s), and all other n's are 1.\n6. So the number of distinct permutations is:\n   7! / (2! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1! * 1!)\n   = 7! / 2!\n   = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / (2 * 1)\n   = 5040 / 2\n   = 2520\n7. 2520 is equal to 7! / 2!, which is choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
