        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. So the area of the full square is:\n   Area of square = 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2\n2. Two semicircles are cut out from opposite sides. The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm (the side length of the square). \n   To find the area of a semicircle, we use the formula:\n   Area of semicircle = (1/2) * pi * r^2\n   Here the radius r is half the diameter, so r = 20/2 = 10 cm.\n   Area of semicircle = (1/2) * pi * 10^2 = 50pi cm^2\n3. There are two semicircles cut out, so the total area removed is:\n   Area removed = 2 * 50pi cm^2 = 100pi cm^2\n4. The remaining area is the original square area minus the area removed:\n   Remaining area = 400 cm^2 - 100pi cm^2\n                  = 400 - 100pi cm^2\n                  ≈ 400 - 314.16 cm^2  (using pi ≈ 3.1416)\n                  ≈ 85.84 cm^2\n5. Looking at the answer choices, the closest value is 87.5 cm^2. \nTherefore, the best answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
