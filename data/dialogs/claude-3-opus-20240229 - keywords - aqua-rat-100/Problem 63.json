        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n* The team won 20 matches\n* They lost 30% of their total matches\n* To find the number of matches lost, we first need to calculate the total number of matches played\n* If we let x = total matches played, then:\n   - x - 20 = matches lost\n   - matches lost / total matches = 30% = 0.30\n* So we can set up the equation:\n   (x - 20) / x = 0.30\n* Solving for x:\n   x - 20 = 0.30x\n   0.70x = 20\n   x = 20/0.70 = 28.57\n* The team played about 29 total matches (rounding 28.57 up since you can't play a fraction of a match)\n* If they won 20 matches out of 29 total, then they lost:\n   29 - 20 = 9 matches\nTherefore, the number of matches the team lost is closest to:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
