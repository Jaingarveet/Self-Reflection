Let me carefully re-read the question and think through it step-by-step to determine the correct answer this time.\nGiven:\n- We are looking for 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers\n- The sum of these numbers divided by 10 is a perfect square\nStep 1: Let's represent the 5 consecutive odd numbers as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, and n+8, where n is the first odd number in the sequence.\nStep 2: The sum of these numbers is:\nn + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20\nStep 3: According to the question, (5n + 20) รท 10 should be a perfect square.\nSimplifying, we get: (n + 4) รท 2 = a perfect square\nStep 4: For (n + 4) รท 2 to be a perfect square, (n + 4) must be an even number and divisible by 2.\nStep 5: Looking at the given choices, we can check which one satisfies the condition that (n + 4) is even and divisible by 2.\nA: 47 + 4 = 51, which is odd\nB: 91 + 4 = 95, which is odd\nC: 41 + 4 = 45, which is odd\nD: 67 + 4 = 71, which is odd\nE: 44 is an even number, so it cannot be part of the sequence of odd numbers\nTherefore, none of the given choices can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers satisfying the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
