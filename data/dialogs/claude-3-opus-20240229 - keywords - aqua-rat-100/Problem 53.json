(1)\nFrom the second condition: \nx + 10 = 3(y - 10)\nx + 10 = 3y - 30\nx = 3y - 40 ... (2)\nSubstituting (1) into (2):\nx = 3(2x - 90) - 40\nx = 6x - 270 - 40\nx = 6x - 310\n-5x = -310\nx = 62\nSubstituting x = 62 into (1):\ny = 2(62) - 90\ny = 124 - 90\ny = 34\nTherefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
