        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) If Amy uses single letters only, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code the 10 types of books. \n2) However, Amy can also use pairs of letters. The key realization is that the order doesn't matter in these pairs. This means she's dealing with combinations, not permutations.\n3) With n letters, the number of unique pairs (combinations) is given by the formula:\n   \n   $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n4) Let's start with the smallest possible n and see if it's enough:\n   For n = 3: \n   Single letters: 3\n   Pairs: $\\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3*2}{2} = 3$\n   Total: 3 + 3 = 6 (not enough)\n   For n = 4:\n   Single letters: 4  \n   Pairs: $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4*3}{2} = 6$\n   Total: 4 + 6 = 10 (just enough!)\n5) Therefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
