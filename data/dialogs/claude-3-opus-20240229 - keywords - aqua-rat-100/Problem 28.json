If they are dependent, P(N) could be higher.\n5) The maximum possible value for P(N) is the smaller of (1 - P(A)) and (1 - P(B)). \n   This would occur if the stocks were perfectly correlated - i.e. Stock B increases if and only if Stock A increases.\n6) 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44\n   1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26\n   The smaller of these is 0.26.\nTherefore, the maximum possible value for the probability that neither stock increases is 0.26.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
