        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question states there are more than 501 students. So the minimum number of students will be the smallest number greater than 501 that satisfies the other constraints.\n2. 20% of the students took physics, and 28% took math. Importantly, it specifies \"exactly\", meaning there is no overlap between these groups. So in total, 20% + 28% = 48% of the students took either physics or math.\n3. Since we're looking for the minimum number of students, let's assume the remaining 52% of students took neither physics nor math. This maximizes the overlap and minimizes the total number of students needed.\n4. Now, the number of students must be divisible by 100 (so the percentages work out to whole numbers), and also by 25 (since 20% and 28% must be whole numbers). The least common multiple of 100 and 25 is 100.\n5. So the minimum number of students will be the smallest multiple of 100 that's greater than 501. That number is 600.\nTherefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 600.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
