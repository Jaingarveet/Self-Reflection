After reflecting on my mistake, I understand that I need to focus on the specific context of the question, which is the surgical procedure \"cyst-gastrostomy\" and its complications. \nHere's my thought process for this question:\n1. **Cyst-gastrostomy**: This is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach.\n2. **Pseudo pancreatic cyst**: This is a collection of fluid near the pancreas that is not a true cyst.\n3. **Major complication**: This refers to a serious problem that can occur after surgery.\nBased on this information, I can eliminate choices A, B, and D:\n* **Infection**: While infection is a possible complication of any surgery, it is not specific to cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts.\n* **Obstruction**: This is not a common complication of cyst-gastrostomy.\n* **Hemorrhage**: This is a rare complication of cyst-gastrostomy.\nTherefore, the most likely major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is:\n**C: Fistula**\nA fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels. In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and another organ, such as the colon or the small intestine. This can lead to serious complications, such as infection and malnutrition.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
