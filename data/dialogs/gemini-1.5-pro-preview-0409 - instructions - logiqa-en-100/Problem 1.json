I might have focused too much on the competition aspect and overlooked the fundamental right to compulsory education.\n## Answering the Question:\n**1. Key aspects of a reasonable education system:**\n* **Right to compulsory education for everyone.**\n* **Access to higher education through fair competition.**\n**2. Evaluation of Options:**\n* **A:** This focuses solely on higher education and disregards the compulsory aspect. \n* **B:** This aligns directly with the right to compulsory education mentioned in the context.\n* **C:** This also aligns with the context by highlighting the unreasonableness of denying compulsory education.\n* **D:** The context defines what is required for a reasonable system; adding more requirements is not implied.\n**3. Prioritization and Choice:**\nBoth B and C align with the context. However, **C directly addresses the unreasonableness of denying a fundamental right**, making it a stronger and more accurate reflection of the context's implications.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
