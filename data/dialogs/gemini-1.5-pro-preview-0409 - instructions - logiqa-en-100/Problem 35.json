This led me to incorrectly eliminate possibilities and arrive at the wrong conclusion.\n## Solving the Problem Step-by-Step:\n1. **Analyze the given information:**\n    - We know there are 5 graduates and 3 employers (Tianshu, Tianji, Tianxuan).\n    - Each employer hired at least one graduate.\n    - Li works at Tianshu (from statement 1).\n    - Li and Zhao work at different places (from statement 2).\n    - Liu and Zhao work at the same place (from statement 3).\n    - If Zhang is at Tianxuan, then Wang is also at Tianxuan (from statement 4).\n2. **Evaluate each option based on the given information:**\n    **A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.** \n    - This contradicts statement 2 (Li and Zhao work at different places) and statement 3 (Liu and Zhao work at the same place). So, this is **NOT possible**.\n    **B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.**\n    - This doesn't contradict any given information. Li is at Tianshu, and this option doesn't specify where Zhang works. So, this is **possible**.\n    **C: Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.**\n    - This contradicts statement 3 (Liu and Zhao work at the same place). So, this is **NOT possible**.\n    **D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.**\n    - This could be possible if Zhang is NOT at Tianxuan (based on statement 4). So, this is **possible**.\n3. **Choose the correct option:**\n    Based on the analysis, options B and D are possible scenarios. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
