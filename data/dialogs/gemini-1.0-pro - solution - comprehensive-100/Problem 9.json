I will use this experience to improve my accuracy in the future.\nHere's the correct solution:\n**Step 1: Determine the scale of the map.**\nThe scale of the map is 1/4 inch = 10 miles. This means that every 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to an actual distance of 10 miles.\n**Step 2: Convert the map distance to actual distance.**\nThe map distance from Town F to Town G is 20 inches. To find the actual distance, we need to multiply the map distance by the scale of the map:\nActual distance = Map distance × Scale\nActual distance = 20 inches × (10 miles/1/4 inch)\n**Step 3: Simplify the expression.**\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply 20 by 10 and divide by 1/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. The reciprocal of 1/4 is 4/1.\nActual distance = 20 × 10 × 4/1\nActual distance = 800 miles\nTherefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 miles.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")**"
