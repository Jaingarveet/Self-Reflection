Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This implies that if the company moves to Ocean View, most employees will have to choose between living further away and having a longer commute or living closer and paying more for housing. The argument does not make any assumptions about the current commute times of Acme employees.\n"

This was a misinterpretation of the argument, which only states that most employees cannot afford housing near Ocean View.\n**Correct Answer:** D\n**Reasoning:** The argument explicitly states that \"most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes\" once the company moves to Ocean View. This implies that currently, most employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
