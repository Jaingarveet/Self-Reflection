        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:**\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I incorrectly assumed that the midpoint of a line segment divides the segment into two equal parts. However, this is only true if the line segment is bisected perpendicularly. In this case, the midpoint U divides line segment ST into two segments, RU and UT, with lengths of 6 and 16, respectively.\n**Correct Answer:**\nTo find the length of line segment RU, we can use the following formula:\n```\nRU = (ST - RT) / 2\n```\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n```\nRU = (22 - 17) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5\n```\nTherefore, the length of line segment RU is 2.5.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
