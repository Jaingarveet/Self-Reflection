What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Identify the given information:\n    - Maximum speed: 700 m/s\n    - Time to travel 700 m high: 40 seconds\n    - Time to pass a point: 5 seconds\n2. Calculate the actual speed:\n    - Speed = Distance / Time\n    - Speed = 700 m / 40 s\n    - Speed = 17.5 m/s\n3. Calculate the length of the space shuttle:\n    - Length = Speed * Time (to pass a point)\n    - Length = 17.5 m/s * 5 s\n    - Length = 87.5 m\n4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length:\n    - Answer: [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]) - closest to the calculated length of 87.5 m\n"
