This can be seen from the fact that those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit in that they strive to develop commercially viable technology.\nQuestion: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\nChoices:\n  A: contains a premise that cannot possibly be true\n  B: takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable\n  C: fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain\n  D: takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome\n  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the assumption that the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on.\nThe gap in my knowledge was in understanding the specific assumption that the argument is based on.\nI knew that the argument assumes that technology cannot be beneficial to society as a whole if it is motivated by personal gain or commercial viability, but I failed to identify the specific assumption that the argument takes for granted.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption identification\n - Misunderstanding of argument assumption\n - Failure to identify specific assumption\nSolution:\nThe argument assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome.\nThe argument takes for granted that technological advances are unlikely to serve the interests of society as a whole unless they are motivated by societal benefit rather than personal gain.\nThe argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the assumption that the argument is based on.\n2. Determine whether the assumption is explicitly stated or implied.\n3. Evaluate the validity of the assumption.\n4. Identify the specific assumption that the argument takes for granted.\n5. Determine whether the assumption is reasonable or unreasonable.\n6. Evaluate the argument's vulnerability to criticism based on the assumption.\n7. Choose the answer that best describes the assumption that the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the assumption that the argument is based on.\n - Always evaluate the validity of the assumption.\n - Always identify the specific assumption that the argument takes for granted.\n - Always evaluate the argument's vulnerability to criticism based on the assumption.\n - Always choose the answer that best describes the assumption that the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on.\n - Remember that an argument can be vulnerable to criticism on multiple grounds, but the question asks for the assumption that the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on.\n"
