On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the inconsistency of the political party's views rather than the assumption underlying the argument in the editorial.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of the question\n - Focusing on the wrong aspect of the argument\n - Failing to identify the underlying assumption\n\nSolution:\nThe argument in the editorial assumes that a consistent political policy cannot hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\nThe editorial argues that the political party's policy is inconsistent because it expresses the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal but also claims that the government should not increase spending on education.\nThe assumption underlying the argument is that a consistent political policy cannot hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument in the editorial.\n2. Determine the assumption underlying the argument.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption underlying the argument.\n4. Choose the answer that best represents the assumption underlying the argument.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the argument and the assumption underlying the argument.\n - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption underlying the argument.\n - Never focus on the wrong aspect of the argument.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the assumption underlying the argument is often not explicitly stated in the argument itself.\n"
