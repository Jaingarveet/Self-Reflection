This means that at that point, he had already driven 2d - 70 miles. We can set up the equation:\n2d - 70 = 70t1 + 90(t2 - 3)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2d - 70 = 70t1 + 90t2 - 270\n2d = 70t1 + 90t2 - 200\nWe can use the first two equations to substitute for d:\n2(70t1) = 70t1 + 90t2 - 200\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n140t1 = 90t2 + 200\nWe also know that t1 + t2 = total time of the trip. Let's call the total time of the trip \"T\":\nt1 + t2 = T\nWe can solve for t2 in terms of t1:\nt2 = T - t1\nSubstituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:\n140t1 = 90(T - t1) + 200\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n50t1 = 90T - 200\nt1 = (90T - 200) / 50\nWe can use this expression to solve for t2:\nt2 = T - t1\nt2 = T - (90T - 200) / 50\nt2 = (10T + 200) / 50\nNow we can use the equation d = 70t1 to solve for d:\nd = 70t1\nd = 70[(90T - 200) / 50]\nd = 126T - 280\nWe know that 2d = 70t1 + 90t2, so we can use this equation to check our answer:\n2d = 70t1 + 90t2\n2d = 70[(90T - 200) / 50] + 90[(10T + 200) / 50]\n2d = 126T + 280\nd = 203.2\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
