We know that the team won 20 matches and lost 30% of their matches. \nAction: \nThe number of matches lost is 30% of the total number of matches played. \nLet's start by finding the total number of matches played. \nTotal matches played = matches won + matches lost\nTotal matches played = 20 + [unknown]\nWe know that the team lost 30% of their matches. So, the number of matches lost is:\nMatches lost = 30% of total matches played\nMatches lost = 0.3(Total matches played)\nWe can substitute the expression for total matches played into the equation for matches lost:\nMatches lost = 0.3(Total matches played)\nMatches lost = 0.3(20 + [unknown])\nMatches lost = 6 + 0.3([unknown])\nWe can simplify this equation by distributing the 0.3:\nMatches lost = 6 + 0.3[unknown]\nMatches lost = 6 + 0.3[unknown]\nNow we can solve for the unknown variable by subtracting 6 from both sides:\nMatches lost - 6 = 0.3[unknown]\n0.3[unknown] = Matches lost - 6\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 0.3 to solve for the unknown variable:\n[unknown] = (Matches lost - 6) / 0.3\nWe don't know the exact number of matches lost, but we can see that the answer will be a multiple of 10. \nLet's try each answer choice to see which one gives us a result that makes sense:\nA) Matches lost = 70 - 20 = 50\n50 is not 30% of the total matches played (70), so this is not the correct answer.\nB) Matches lost = 30% of total matches played = 0.3(20 + 50) = 0.3(70) = 21\nThis answer makes sense, so we will choose B.\nC) Matches lost = 3 is not 30% of the total matches played (23), so this is not the correct answer.\nD) Matches lost = 7 is not 30% of the total matches played (27), so this is not the correct answer.\nE) Matches lost = 5 is not 30% of the total matches played (25), so this is not the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
