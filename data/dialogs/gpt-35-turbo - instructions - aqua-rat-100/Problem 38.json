Subtract the surface area of the inner cube from the surface area of the outer cube to find the surface area of the hollow cube.\n5. Calculate the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface.\n6. Multiply the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface by 6 to find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes.\n7.
