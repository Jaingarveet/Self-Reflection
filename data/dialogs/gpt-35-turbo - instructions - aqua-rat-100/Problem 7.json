If we use a single letter to represent each type, we need at least 10 letters. If we use a pair of two different letters to represent each type, we can use the combination formula to calculate the number of possible pairs: C(10,2) = 45. Therefore, we need at least 45 letters to represent each type with a pair of two different letters. Since we want to find the smallest number of letters, we should choose the smaller value, which is 10.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
