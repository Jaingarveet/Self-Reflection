        "content": "Self-reflection:\nI made a mistake in my previous answer by not accounting for the fact that the question asks for the minimum selling price per component, not the total revenue needed. To solve this problem, I need to calculate the total production cost per year, the desired yearly profit, and the required revenue from sales. Then, I can divide the required revenue by the number of units produced per year to find the minimum selling price per component.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \nTo calculate the total production cost per year, I multiply the production cost per component by the number of units produced per month and then by 12 months: \n$110 x 420 x 12 = $554,400\nTo calculate the desired yearly profit, I add the desired profit to the total production cost per year: \n$554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800\nTo calculate the required revenue from sales, I divide the desired yearly profit by the number of units produced per year: \n$1,180,800 รท 420 = $2,808\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $2,808, which is closest to answer choice D: 260."
