The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?\nChoices:\n  A: 0.9\n  B: 0.8\n  C: 0.6\n  D: 0.65\n  E: 1.5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the frequency and start time of each train.\n2. Calculate the probability of the man catching each train.\n3. Calculate the probability of the man catching both trains.\n4. Calculate the probability of the man catching either train.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"

Probability of catching the main line train = 1/6\n   Probability of catching the harbor line train = 1/6\n3. Probability of catching both trains = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n4. Probability of catching either train = 1 - probability of missing both trains\n   Probability of missing both trains = (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36\n   Probability of catching either train = 1 - 25/36 = 11/36\n5.
