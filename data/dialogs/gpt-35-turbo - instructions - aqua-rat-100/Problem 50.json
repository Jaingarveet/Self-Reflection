        "content": "1. Let the speed of the ship be S.\n   The speed of the plane is 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10S.\n2. The ship traveled for some time before meeting the plane. Let the time it traveled be T.\n   Therefore, the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is D = ST.\n3. The plane started flying after the ship had traveled 180 miles.\n   Therefore, the distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is D + 180.\n4. The total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented by the equation:\n   D + 180 = (10S + S)T\n5. The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is D = ST.\n6. The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is D + 180.\n7. Substituting the equation for D in the equation for the total distance traveled, we get:\n   ST + 180 = 11ST\n   180 = 10ST\n   T = 18\n8. Substituting T = 18 in the equation for D, we get:\n   D = ST = S(18)\n   D = 18S\n9. Substituting T = 18 in the equation for the distance traveled by the plane, we get:\n   D + 180 = (10S + S)T\n   D + 180 = 11ST\n   D + 180 = 198S\n   D = 198S - 180\n10. Adding the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane to the distance traveled by the plane when they meet, we get:\n    Distance from starting point = D + D + 180\n                                = 18S + (198S - 180)\n                                = 216S - 180\n11. We do not have enough information to calculate the value of S or the distance from the starting point. Therefore, the answer cannot be determined from the given information.
