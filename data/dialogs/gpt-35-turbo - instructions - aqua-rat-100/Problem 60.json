However, the problem only states that minor arc AC is bisected by segment BD. This changes the diagram and the solution. After redrawing the diagram and using the angle addition postulate, I found that the measure of minor arc AD is 140°. \nSolution:\n1. Given: Minor arc AC = 160°, Minor arc BD = 150°, B bisects minor arc AC\n2. To find: Measure of minor arc AD\n3. Draw a diagram to visualize the problem. [REDACTED]\n4. Relevant theorem: Angle addition postulate\n5. Assume that segment BD bisects minor arc AC at point E.\n6. Using the angle addition postulate, we can find the measure of minor arc AE:\n   - Measure of minor arc AC = 160°\n   - Measure of minor arc BE = 1/2 * measure of minor arc AC = 80°\n   - Measure of minor arc AE = Measure of minor arc AB + Measure of minor arc BE = 80° + x (let x be the measure of minor arc AB)\n   - Measure of minor arc AB = Measure of minor arc BD - Measure of minor arc AD = 150° - y (let y be the measure of minor arc AD)\n   - Measure of minor arc DE = 1/2 * measure of minor arc BD = 75°\n   - Measure of minor arc AD = Measure of minor arc AE + Measure of minor arc ED = (80° + x) + 75° = 155° + x\n7. We know that B bisects minor arc AC, so angle ABC is congruent to angle CBD. Therefore, x = y.\n8. Substitute x = y into the equation for minor arc AD: Measure of minor arc AD = 155° + x = 155° + y\n9. Measure of minor arc BD = Measure of minor arc AB + Measure of minor arc AD\n   - 150° = x + (155° + x)\n   - 150° = 2x + 155°\n   - -5° = 2x\n   - x = -2.5°\n10. Substitute x = -2.5° into the equation for minor arc AD: Measure of minor arc AD = 155° + x = 155° - 2.5° = 152.5°\n11. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
