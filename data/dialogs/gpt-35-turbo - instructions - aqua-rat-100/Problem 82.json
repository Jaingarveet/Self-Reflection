        "content": "Thought:\n1. The radius of the circle that the cow can graze is 14 feet.\n2. The area of the circle is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*(14/2)^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places).\n3. The cow can graze 10 sq.ft. per day.\n4. The area of the field is unknown.\n5. Let's assume that the field is a perfect circle with an area of [REDACTED] = pi*r^2. We can solve for r using the formula r = sqrt(A/pi) = sqrt([REDACTED]/pi) = sqrt([REDACTED]) = [REDACTED] (rounded to two decimal places). Therefore, the radius of the field is approximately 56.08 feet.\n6. The area of the field is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*(56.08)^2 = 9,886.47 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places).\n7. The cow can graze 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/10 = 988.65 days (rounded to two decimal places) for the cow to graze the whole field.\n8. The answer choices are all in whole numbers, so we need to round our result. Rounding 988.65 to the nearest whole number gives us 989.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
