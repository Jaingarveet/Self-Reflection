        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe information provided states that until 1985, the cabin air in planes was replenished once every 30 minutes, but since then, it has been replenished once every hour. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in planes has increased.\n\nThe question asks which statement is most strongly supported by this information. The correct answer is that in 1980, the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. This is because in 1980, the air was replenished more frequently, leading to lower levels of carbon dioxide.\n"
