So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.\nQuestion: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners\n  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog\n  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city\n  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood\n  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe argument assumes that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights. However, this assumption could be flawed if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are.\n\nTo evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know [REDACTED] (choice E). If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then it would be more likely that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. However, if residents of Flynn Heights are not more likely to license their dogs, then the argument is weaker.\n"
