Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I made several errors in my reasoning and calculations:\n1. **Misunderstanding the problem:** I misinterpreted the question and assumed that the hollow cube was completely empty inside, which is not the case. The hollow cube still has smaller cubes inside, forming the walls of the hollow space.\n2. **Incorrect calculation of unpainted faces:** I subtracted the number of small cubes on the outer surface from the total number of small cubes, which is not the correct way to calculate the number of unpainted faces.\n3. **Ignoring the thickness of the walls:** I did not consider the thickness of the walls (1 cm) when calculating the number of small cubes on the outer surface.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misunderstanding the problem\n* Incorrect calculation\n* Ignoring details\n* Misinterpretation\n**Solution:**\nHere's the correct step-by-step solution:\n1. **Calculate the number of small cubes on each face:** 5 cm x 5 cm = 25 small cubes\n2. **Calculate the number of small cubes on all six faces:** 25 cubes/face x 6 faces = 150 cubes\n3. **Calculate the number of small cubes inside the hollow space:** (4 cm x 4 cm x 4 cm) = 64 cubes\n4. **Calculate the total number of small cubes:** 150 cubes (outer surface) + 64 cubes (inside) = 214 cubes\n5. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:** 214 cubes - 150 cubes (outer surface) = 64 cubes\n6. **Each unpainted cube has 5 faces:** 64 cubes x 5 faces/cube = 320 faces\n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n2. Identify all the relevant information provided in the problem.\n3. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n4. Show your work and calculations clearly.\n5. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before arriving at an answer.\n6. Consider all possible scenarios and interpretations of the problem.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* Pay close attention to details and keywords in the problem statement.\n* Visualize the problem and draw diagrams if necessary.\n* Use logical reasoning and mathematical principles to solve the problem.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for clarification if you are unsure about anything.\n* Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and problem-solving skills. \n"
