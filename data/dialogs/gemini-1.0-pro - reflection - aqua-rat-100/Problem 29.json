Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation of the number of days it takes for the frog to reach the top of the well. I correctly calculated the frog's net progress each day (1 meter) but failed to account for the fact that the frog only needs to jump 1 meter on the final day to reach the top.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Off-by-one error\n- Edge case error\nSolution:\n1. Calculate the net progress the frog makes each day: 3 meters up - 2 meters down = 1 meter.\n2. Calculate the number of days it takes the frog to reach the top of the well, excluding the final day: 30 meters / 1 meter/day = 30 days.\n3. On the final day, the frog only needs to jump 1 meter to reach the top.\n4. Therefore, it will take the frog 30 days - 1 day = 29 days to come out of the well.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and understand the scenario.\n2. Identify the key information: the depth of the well, the frog's jumping distance, and the frog's falling distance.\n3. Calculate the net progress the frog makes each day.\n4. Calculate the number of days it takes the frog to reach the top of the well, excluding the final day.\n5. Consider the special case of the final day, where the frog only needs to jump a short distance to reach the top.\n6. Add the number of days from step 4 and the final day to get the total number of days.\n7. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\nGeneral Advice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem, especially for edge cases or special conditions.\n- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n- Use clear and concise language in your calculations and reasoning.\n- Double-check your work to avoid careless mistakes.\n- Consider alternative approaches or solutions to the problem.\n- Learn from your mistakes and use them to improve your problem-solving skills."
