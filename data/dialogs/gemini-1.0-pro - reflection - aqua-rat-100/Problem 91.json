Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the north and south movements would cancel each other out, resulting in a net movement of 5km east. However, the problem states that A travels 3km north, which means they end up 3km north of their starting point. Therefore, the north and south movements do not cancel each other out, and A is actually 3km north of their starting point.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of problem statement\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Failure to account for all movements\nSolution:\n1. Identify the starting point of A.\n2. Identify the direction and distance of each movement.\n3. Calculate the net movement in each direction (north-south and east-west).\n4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the total distance from the starting point.\n```\nNet movement north: 3km north - 3km south = 0km\nNet movement east: 5km east - 2km west = 3km\nTotal distance: sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = 3km\n```\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the problem statement and identify all relevant information.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n3. Calculate the net movement in each direction separately.\n4. Use the appropriate formula (e.g., Pythagorean theorem) to calculate the total distance.\n5. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.\nGeneral Advice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem statement.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n- Consider all possible movements and their impact on the final position.\n- Use appropriate formulas and calculations to determine the final distance.\n- Double-check your work to ensure accuracy."
