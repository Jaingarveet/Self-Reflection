Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial calculation was incorrect. I multiplied the map distance (20 inches) by the scale (10 miles/inch) but forgot to divide by 4, which represents the 1/4 inch increment on the map. This resulted in an overestimation of the actual distance.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Misinterpretation of scale\n* Multiplication error\n* Division error\n* Unit conversion error\n## Solution:\n1. Identify the map distance: 20 inches\n2. Identify the scale: 1/4 inch represents 10 miles\n3. Convert the map distance to miles: 20 inches * (10 miles / 1/4 inch) = 800 miles\n4. Simplify the expression: 800 miles\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully read the problem and identify the given information.\n2. Pay close attention to the units used in the problem.\n3. Convert all units to a consistent system before performing calculations.\n4. Accurately interpret the scale provided in the problem.\n5. Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring each step is correct.\n6. Double-check your calculations and final answer before submitting.\n## General Advice:\n* Be mindful of unit conversions and ensure consistency throughout the problem.\n* Visualize the problem and the scale to aid in understanding.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* Double-check your work and calculations to avoid errors.\n* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and problem-solving skills."
