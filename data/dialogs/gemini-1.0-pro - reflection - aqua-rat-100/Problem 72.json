        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nI incorrectly identified the length of the other side of the yard as 60 feet. My error stemmed from misinterpreting the relationship between the area and the side lengths of a rectangle. I focused solely on the total area (3,000 sq ft) and one side length (100 ft) without considering the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle (length x width = area).\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation\n* Incomplete analysis\n* Formula application error\n## Solution\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Identify the formula:** Area of a rectangle = length x width\n2. **Substitute known values:** 3,000 sq ft (area) and 100 ft (width)\n3. **Solve for the unknown:** length = area / width = 3,000 sq ft / 100 ft = 30 ft\n## Instructions for Future Success\n1. **Read the question carefully:** Ensure complete understanding of the problem.\n2. **Identify relevant formulas:** Apply appropriate formulas to solve the problem.\n3. **Substitute known values:** Plug in the given information into the formula.\n4. **Solve for the unknown:** Calculate the missing value using the formula.\n5. **Double-check calculations:** Verify the accuracy of your calculations.\n6. **Consider all possible solutions:** Ensure the answer aligns with the problem's context.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or sketches to represent the problem.\n* **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Check your units:** Ensure units are consistent throughout the calculations.\n* **Estimate the answer:** Get a rough idea of the expected answer before calculating.\n* **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze errors to improve problem-solving skills. \n"
