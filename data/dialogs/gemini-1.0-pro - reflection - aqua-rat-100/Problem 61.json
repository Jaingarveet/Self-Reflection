Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?\nChoices:\n  A: 180\n  B: 90\n  C: 270\n  D: 360\n  E: None of the above\n\nThought:\nLet's denote the distance between A and B as x.\nThe time it took Kevin to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.\nThe time it took Kevin to travel from B to A is x/90 hours.\nThe total time of the trip is x/70 + x/90 = 3 + 3 = 6 hours.\nThree hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B, which means he had already traveled x - 70 miles.\nTherefore, the time it took him to travel x - 70 miles is (x - 70)/70 hours.\nWe know that this time is equal to 3 hours.\nSo, (x - 70)/70 = 3\nx - 70 = 210\nx = 280 miles\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

I incorrectly assumed that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was halfway between A and B. This led me to the wrong answer.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of the problem\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Algebraic error\nSolution:\nLet's denote the distance between A and B as x.\nThe time it took Kevin to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.\nThe time it took Kevin to travel from B to A is x/90 hours.\nThe total time of the trip is x/70 + x/90 = 6 hours.\nThree hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B, which means he had already traveled x - 70 miles.\nTherefore, the time it took him to travel x - 70 miles is (x - 70)/70 hours.\nWe know that this time is 3 hours less than the total time of the trip, which is 6 - 3 = 3 hours.\nSo, (x - 70)/70 = 3\nx - 70 = 210\nx = 280 miles\nInstructions:\n1.
