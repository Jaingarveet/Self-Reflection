She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

Determine the number of different types of books.\n2. Determine the maximum number of types of books that can be represented using single letters.\n3. If the number of types of books is less than or equal to the maximum number of types of books that can be represented using single letters, then use single letters for all types of books.\n4. Otherwise, use single letters for as many types of books as possible and then use pairs of letters for the remaining types of books.\n5. Calculate the total number of letters needed.\nAdvice:\n- Carefully consider all possible options before making a decision.\n- Do not make unnecessary assumptions about the problem.\n- Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n- Double-check your calculations and reasoning."
