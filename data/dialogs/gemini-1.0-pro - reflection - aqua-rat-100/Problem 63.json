Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.\n2. Define a variable to represent the unknown quantity.\n3. Set up an equation that relates the given information to the unknown quantity.\n4. Solve the equation for the unknown quantity.\n5. Check your answer to make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n6. Be mindful of rounding errors and interpret the results accordingly.\nAdvice:\n- When dealing with percentages, remember to convert them into decimals before performing calculations.\n- Pay attention to units and make sure they are consistent throughout the problem.\n- Double-check your calculations and make sure your final answer is reasonable.\n- Consider using estimation to check your answer for reasonableness.\n- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps."
