F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and the other three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?\nChoices:\n  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X\n  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y\n  C: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, Y, W\n  D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always consider all given information, even if some seems irrelevant at first.\n - Be careful about the phrasing of the question - \"must be\" is different from \"may be\".\n - Check each potential solution methodically against all conditions.\n - Don't make unwarranted assumptions; only draw conclusions based on the given information.\n - In complex problems, break things down and reason step-by-step.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. F must be in production (given).\n2. H and Y must be together (given). Since there are 3 people per department except public relations, H and Y must be in either production or sales. \n3. If H and Y are in production with F, that completes the production department. In this case, G, I and one of W or X would have to be in sales. But if X is in sales, W must be in production (given), which is not possible here. So H and Y cannot be in production.\n4. Therefore, H and Y must be in sales. F is in production, and G cannot be with F, so G must be in sales. \n5. That leaves I, W and X. We know W and X cannot both be in sales. I must be in production with F to complete that department. \n6. So either W is in production and X in public relations, or X is in production and W in public relations.\nLooking at the choices, only D matches this reasoning: X in public relations, F, I and W in production, and G, H and Y in sales.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
