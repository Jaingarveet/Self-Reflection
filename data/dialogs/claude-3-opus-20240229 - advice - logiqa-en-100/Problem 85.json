If paper G is used, then paper J cannot be used (condition 2). But the question doesn't state that G is definitely used. So we can't conclude that both G and H are used. Choice B may or may not be true.\n3. If paper K is used, then paper G must be used (contrapositive of condition 3). But again, we don't know for sure if K is used. So choice C may or may not be true. \n4. If paper G is not used, then paper K is not used (condition 3). In this case, from the remaining papers F, H, J - paper H can be used without J (condition 2), and papers F and J can be used together. So it's possible to not use both G and J. \nTherefore, the only choice that must be true based on the given conditions is D. If G is not used, J will also not be used.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
