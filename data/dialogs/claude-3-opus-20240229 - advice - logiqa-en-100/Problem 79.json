In other words, which choice fails to challenge the reasoning.\nChoice A challenges the argument by pointing out circular reasoning - using sensory evidence to prove the external world assumes the external world exists in the first place. This is a valid rebuttal.\nChoice B challenges by questioning how we can know others have similar experiences. This casts doubt on point 2 of the argument. Also a reasonable rebuttal.\nChoice C states that mirages are real, not illusions, because visual experience is reliable. Rather than challenging the argument, this actually seems to support the idea that our senses give us accurate information about an external reality. It fails to provide doubt.\nChoice D questions why science would be so successful if there was no real external world it described. This challenges the argument by implying the alternative (no external world) leads to a strange conclusion. It is a relevant rebuttal.\nTherefore, Choice C is the only one that does not offer doubt or rebuttal against the original argument. It sides with the argument rather than questioning it.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
