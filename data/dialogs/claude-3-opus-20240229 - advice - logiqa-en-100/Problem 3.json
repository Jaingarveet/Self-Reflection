It doesn't make unsupported claims.\nB) This is too strong. The text doesn't say you'll definitely lose if not the best, just that you need one advantage to compete.\nC) \"Definitely make huge profits\" is an exaggeration not supported by the text. Being the best in one area helps you compete but doesn't guarantee huge profits.\nD) \"Cannot succeed\" is too absolute. The text focuses more on initial competition than long-term success.\nConsidering the advice, A summarizes the key point without adding unsupported details or interpretations. The other choices use language that's too strong or absolute compared to the original text.\nTherefore, A is the best answer.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
