At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read questions carefully and make sure you understand exactly what is being asked before attempting to answer.\n - In logic questions about arguments, differentiate between the content of an argument and the method/structure of an argument.\n - When someone refutes an argument, identify if they are attacking the conclusion, the premises, or the overall logic and persuasiveness of the argument.\n - Eliminate answer choices that do not fit the refutation method used, even if they seem somewhat relevant to the argument's content.\n - If you find yourself focusing too much on the details of the arguments, take a step back and look at the big picture of how the arguments interact.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Xiao Chen argues that the flickering light from Comet 1996D3 must be unusual, because people have never before observed such flickers from comets far from the sun. \n2. Xiao Wang counters by saying that people don't normally observe comets far from the sun at all. The flickering light was only discovered through continuous and careful tracking.\n3. Xiao Wang is not saying Xiao Chen's concepts are ambiguous (A), or that Xiao Chen's argument contradicts itself (C). \n4. Xiao Wang also does not seem to be agreeing with Xiao Chen's conclusion (E). He is disagreeing that the flickering is necessarily unusual.\n5. Xiao Wang is providing an alternative explanation for why the flickering wasn't observed before - because people don't normally track distant comets carefully. This fits with choice (D).\n6. While Xiao Wang is implying Xiao Chen's argument is unpersuasive (B), this is more of an indirect effect rather than his main refutation method. His primary approach is offering an alternative explanation.\nTherefore, the best answer is (D) - Xiao Wang disagrees with Xiao Chen's conclusion and puts forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
