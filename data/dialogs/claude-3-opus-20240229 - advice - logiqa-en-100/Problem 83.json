        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that either E or F will participate, but not both. Let's consider each case:\nCase 1: E participates, F does not\n- If F does not participate, then M does not participate. \n- One of J or K must participate. If J participates, then G must also participate.\nSo in this case, the definite participants are E and one of J+G or K.\nCase 2: F participates, E does not  \n- If F participates, then M's participation is not restricted.\n- One of J or K must still participate. If J, then G must also participate.\nSo in this case, the definite participants are F and one of J+G or K.\n2. The question states that H does not participate. This doesn't change any of the above logic.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) F and G - Possible in Case 2 if J is chosen, but not definite \nB) E and M - Not possible, as E's participation means M cannot participate\nC) F and K - Possible in Case 2 if K is chosen, but not definite\nD) G and K - Not possible, as J must participate if G does\n4. There is no combination of two specific players that must always be included based on the given conditions. The question cannot be definitively answered.\nTherefore, the problem as stated does not provide enough information to conclusively determine two specific players that must participate when H does not. The correct answer is that no single answer choice is always true.\nAction: The question cannot be answered definitively based on the information provided. None of the answer choices are necessarily true in all valid scenarios."
