So the order of F and H is fixed as well: F, then H.\n3. I and E are adjacent, but their order relative to each other is not specified. So I and E are the variable components.\n4. There are two possible arrangements of I and E: \n   - I, then E\n   - E, then I\n5. Now, let's consider how the I-E pair can be arranged relative to the fixed G-F-H sequence:\n   - G, I, E, F, H\n   - G, E, I, F, H\n6. These are the only two possible arrangements that satisfy all the given constraints with G as the northernmost island.\nTherefore, there are 2 possible arrangements of the islands if G is northernmost.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
