        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question states that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy. \n2. It also states that based on Green Island's production and management structure, if it can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve a 20% productivity increase.\n3. Let's consider each answer choice:\nA) This is not necessarily true. The information states that a 10% increase is needed to avoid bankruptcy. It does not say that failing to achieve a 20% increase will lead to bankruptcy.\nB) This looks promising. If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can achieve a 20% increase. And a 10% increase is what's needed to avoid bankruptcy. So a 20% increase would also avoid bankruptcy.\nC) The information doesn't say anything about what happens if the market doesn't change. We can't determine if this statement is true.\nD) This contradicts the given information. The passage states that if a 10% increase is possible, then a 20% increase is also achievable. It's not impossible as this choice suggests.\n4. After analyzing each choice, B is the only one that must be true based on the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
