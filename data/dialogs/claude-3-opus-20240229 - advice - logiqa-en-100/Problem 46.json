        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Condition (1) states that H and Y must be in the same department. This means they will either both be in production, both in sales, or one of them will be in public relations with the other in the same department as well.\n2. Condition (2) states F and G cannot be in the same department. We know from condition (4) that F must be in production. Therefore, G cannot be in production.\n3. Condition (3) links X and W - if X is in sales, then W must be in production. However, it doesn't specify anything about where W is if X is not in sales.\n4. Now let's consider each answer choice:\n   A) G and I: There's no condition preventing this. G can't be in production (because of F), but G and I could both be in sales.\n   \n   B) G and X: Again, no condition prevents this. G and X could both be in sales.\n   \n   C) G and Y: Condition (1) requires Y to be with H. If H is the public relations employee, then Y must also be in public relations, preventing Y from being in sales with G. However, if H and Y are both in production or both in sales, then G could still be in sales with Y.\n   \n   D) H and W: Condition (1) requires H to be with Y. If Y is the public relations employee, then H must also be in public relations, preventing H from being in sales with W. And if H and Y are in production or sales, then there's no room for W in sales as well, because there can only be 3 employees in each of those departments.\n5. Therefore, the only pair that cannot be in sales together is H and W.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
