This suggests \"Doximayo\" likely means \"student\".\nIn sentence 2, \"Makasey\" is between \"hostage\" and \"reporter\". So \"Makasey\" probably means \"holding\" or \"see\". \nAnd in sentence 3, \"Mugbudengs\" is at the start before \"reporters\", in the same position as \"kidnapping\" in sentence 1. This implies \"Mugbudengs\" means \"kidnapping\".\nPutting it together:\n- \"Doximayo\" means \"student\" \n- \"Makasey\" means \"holding\" or \"see\"\n- \"Mugbudengs\" means \"kidnapping\"\n- \"Alingoits\" likely means \"away\" based on its position in sentences 1 and 3\nTherefore, of the given choices, B and C are true:\nB: \"Doximayo\" means \"student\" \nC: \"Mugbudengs\" means \"kidnapping\"\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
