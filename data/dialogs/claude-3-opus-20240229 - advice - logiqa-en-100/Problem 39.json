This means it cannot distinguish colors, but it can distinguish shapes. So Robot 1 must be Type B.\n2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it cannot distinguish colors. But we don't know if it can distinguish shapes or not based on this information alone. So Robot 2 could be either Type B or Type C.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) Both being Type C is not possible, because we know Robot 1 is Type B. \nB) This is possible, if Robot 2 is Type C while Robot 1 is Type B.\nC) We know Robot 1 is Type B not A, so this is false.\nD) We know Robot 1 is definitely Type B. And while Robot 2 might not be Type A, we can't be certain of that. So this is not necessarily true.\nTherefore, the only answer that must be true based on the information given is B - only one of the robots (Robot 2) could be Type C, while the other (Robot 1) is definitely Type B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
