        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe given opinion states that sand and dust storms in Inner Mongolia are natural disasters caused by climate drought, grassland degradation and desertification. The opinion implies they are inevitable.\nNow let's consider each choice:\nA: This shows the grassland has severely degraded over time in Inner Mongolia. While concerning, it doesn't directly contradict the opinion that the storms are due to natural causes. It could still be consistent with drought and desertification.\nB: The fact that grasslands are much healthier in Mongolia, right across the border, strongly suggests the degradation in China is not purely due to natural factors. If it was just climate/natural causes, you'd expect to see similar degradation in the adjacent region. This choice questions the opinion.\nC: Similar to B, if a thin uninhabited strip still has healthy grass, that implies human factors are the primary cause of the degradation elsewhere, not inevitable natural causes. This also questions the opinion.\nD: This choice directly attributes the increase in dust storms to human activities like overgrazing, rather than portraying them as inevitable natural disasters. It clearly contradicts the stated opinion.\nTherefore, the only choice that does not question the opinion is A. While it shows the grasslands have degraded, it doesn't rule out natural causes.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
