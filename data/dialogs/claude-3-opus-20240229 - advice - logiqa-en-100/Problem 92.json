        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Professor Zhao said the champion is neither Tsinghua University nor Zhejiang University. This means the champion must be either the University of Science and Technology of China or Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.\n2. Professor Qian said the champion is not Tsinghua University, but is the University of Science and Technology of China. This contradicts Professor Zhao, so one of them must be completely wrong.\n3. Professor Sun said the champion is not the University of Science and Technology of China, but is Tsinghua University. This also contradicts both Professor Zhao and Professor Qian.\n4. We are told that one professor judged both correctly, one judged one correctly and one incorrectly, and one judged both incorrectly. \n5. If Professor Zhao was correct, then Professor Qian and Professor Sun must both be wrong, but this violates the condition that one professor has one correct and one incorrect judgment.\n6. If Professor Qian was correct, then Professor Zhao and Professor Sun would both be wrong, which is not allowed.\n7. Therefore, Professor Sun must be the one who is correct. This means Tsinghua University is the champion.\nIn conclusion, the only possibility consistent with the given information is that Tsinghua University is the champion.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
