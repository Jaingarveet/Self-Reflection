        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. From condition (4), we know F must be in production. \n2. If X and F are in the same department (as the question states), then X must also be in production.\n3. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W is in production. But we determined X is not in sales, so this condition doesn't apply. W could be in any department.\n4. From condition (2), since F is in production, G cannot be in production. G must be in either sales or public relations.\n5. From condition (1), H and Y must be in the same department. There are 3 possibilities:\n   - H and Y in production with F and X\n   - H and Y in sales\n   - H and Y in public relations\n6. For the remaining employees I and W, we can deduce:\n   - If H and Y are in production, then I and W must be split between sales and public relations. \n   - If H and Y are in sales, then I and W could both be in production, or one in production and one in public relations.\n   - If H and Y are in public relations, then I and W must both be in sales.\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\nA: \"G is assigned to the sales department\" - This could be true. It doesn't contradict any of our deductions.\nB: \"H is assigned to the production department\" - This could be true if Y is also in production.\nC: \"I was assigned to the sales department\" - This could be true in some scenarios, like if H and Y are in public relations.\nD: \"W is assigned to the public relations department\" - This CANNOT be true. If X and F are both in production, and H and Y are together in another department, then the public relations department must be filled by either G, I, or H and Y. There's no scenario where W is in public relations.\nTherefore, the statement that cannot be true is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
