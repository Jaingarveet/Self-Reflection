        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. E or F will participate, but not both. This means we have two possibilities:\n   - E participates, F does not\n   - F participates, E does not\n2. One of J or K will participate, but not both. Again, two possibilities: \n   - J participates, K does not\n   - K participates, J does not\n3. If J participates, then G participates. This is a key piece of information. It means:\n   - If we choose J, we must also choose G\n   - If we don't choose G, we can't choose J\n4. Unless F participates, M does not participate. In other words:\n   - If F does not participate, M does not participate\n   - M can only participate if F participates\n5. Now, let's look at the answer choices. We need to find a pair that, if selected, leaves only one possible combination for the other two slots.\n   - Choice A: F and H. If we select F, then M can also be selected. But this doesn't force a unique choice for the 4th slot. So A is not correct.\n   - Choice B: G and J. If we select G and J, then we can't select F (because E or F, but not both). And we can't select M (because F isn't selected). The only remaining options are H and K, and we must select K (because J is selected, so K can't be). This forces a unique team: G, J, H, K. So B could be correct.\n   - Choice C: G and M. If we select G and M, then we must also select F (because M requires F). This leaves only one slot, which could be filled by H, J, or K. So C is not correct.\n   - Choice D: H and M. Similar to C, if we select M, we must also select F. But then we could select either G or E for the 4th slot. So D is not correct.\nTherefore, the only choice that forces a unique team is B: G and J.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
