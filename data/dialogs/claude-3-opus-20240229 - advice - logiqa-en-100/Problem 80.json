The finance department is directly above the planning department.\n3. The administration department is above the planning department but below human resources.\nFrom condition 2, we know the planning department must be directly below the finance department. \nCondition 3 tells us the order must be:\nPlanning -> Finance -> Administration -> Human Resources \nThe sales and R&D departments are the only ones not placed yet. From condition 1, sales cannot be directly above or below human resources.\nSo the two possible orderings from bottom to top are:\nPlanning, Finance, Administration, R&D, Human Resources, Sales\nOR  \nPlanning, Finance, Administration, Sales, Human Resources, R&D\nLooking at the answer choices, the first option matches choice C:\nPlanning Department, Finance Department, Sales Department, R & D Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
