        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe key claim made by the bridge expert is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to allow giant ships to pass through and fully open up the Yangtze River waterway.\nLooking at each answer choice:\nA) This choice supports the expert's view by suggesting the bridge is preventing large ships and hurting trade. It does not raise doubts.\nB) This choice directly contradicts the expert's main point. If 99% of large international ships dock below the Nanjing Bridge anyway, and ports above it rarely receive large ships, then demolishing the bridge to allow giant ship passage seems unnecessary. The current bridge is not actually hindering shipping significantly.\nC) This suggests the problem is bigger than just the Nanjing Bridge. But it still implies the expert is correct that bridges like Nanjing's need to be rebuilt, so it supports rather than challenges the main assertion.\nD) This indicates some large ships are already able to pass through to Wuhan with current bridge heights. That ability raises some doubt on the claim that demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge is essential for large ship passage.\nConsidering all the choices, B most directly challenges the expert's key claim by suggesting the Nanjing Bridge is not actually a major obstacle to shipping, since the vast majority of large ships aren't traveling that far up the Yangtze anyway. It provides the strongest reason to doubt the assertion that this specific bridge must be demolished and rebuilt.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
