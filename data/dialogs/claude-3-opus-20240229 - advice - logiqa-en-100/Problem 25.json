They are the same height. \nThe key is that Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. Since Wang Wei is a doctor, he must be tall in order to be a candidate. Therefore, Li Qiang cannot also be tall, eliminating him.\nThis means Liu Dawei must be the tall and handsome one. Since he's not a doctor, Wu Gang must be the other tall doctor besides Wang Wei.\nTherefore, the only person who meets all 3 criteria is Liu Dawei.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
