Since $g(4) = 8$, we can set $x = 4$ in the function and simplify: $g(4) = a(4)^2 + 24 = a(16) + 24 = 20$.\n\nNow, we are given that $g(-4) = ?$. Let's substitute $x = -4$ in the function: $g(-4) = a(-4)^2 + 24 = a(16) + 24 = 20$.\n\nAction: Therefore, the value of $g(-4)$ is $20$. The correct answer is (D) $g(-4) = 20$.\n\nReflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my initial answer by not simplifying the expression for $g(4)$ correctly. I also noticed that the function $g(x)$ is a quadratic function, which made it easier to identify the correct answer."
