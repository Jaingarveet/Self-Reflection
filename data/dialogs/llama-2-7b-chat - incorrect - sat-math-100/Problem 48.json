However, I made a mistake in my calculation and ended up with $x = y - \\frac{1}{4}$, which is not the correct answer.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I need to solve for $x$ in the first equation and then solve for $y$ in the second equation. Once I have the values of $x$ and $y$, I can substitute them into the second equation to find the value of $c$.\n\nSolving for $x$ in the first equation, I get $x = 3$. Substituting this value into the second equation, I get $y = 3 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $x$ is $y$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$."
