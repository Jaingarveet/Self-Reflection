From the table, we can see that $f(n)$ increases by 1 for each increase in $n$.\n\nOption A, $f(n) = n - 3$, does not match the values in the table.

For example, $f(2) = 2 \\times 2 - 4 = 4$, which is the value shown in the table.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: $f(n) = 2n - 4$.\n\nAction: I will answer the question using the correct option.\n\nAnswer: $f(n) = 2n - 4$."
