Similarly, the width was decreased by $p$ percent, which means the new width is $0.90$ times the original width.\n\nThe area of the rectangle before the alterations was $A = l \\times w$, where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width. After the alterations, the area of the rectangle is $A' = l' \\times w'$, where $l'$ is the new length and $w'$ is the new width.\n\nThe problem states that the area of the rectangle after the alterations is $A' = 0.988 \\times A$, where $0.988$ is the percentage decrease in area.\n\nFrom this information, I can set up the following equation:\n\n$l' = 1.10l$\n$w' = 0.90w$\n$A' = 0.988 \\times A$\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, I get:\n\n$l' = 1.10l \\Rightarrow l = 1.10l$\n$w' = 0.90w \\Rightarrow w = 0.90w$\n$A' = 0.988 \\times A \\Rightarrow A = 0.988 \\times A$\n\nFrom the first equation, I can see that the new length is 10% longer than the original length, so $l = 1.10l$.\nFrom the second equation, I can see that the new width is 90% of the original width, so $w = 0.90w$.\nFrom the third equation, I can see that the area of the rectangle before the alterations is 98.8% of the area after the alterations, so $A = 0.988 \\times A$.\n\nNow, I need to find the value of $p$ that satisfies the equation $A = 0.988 \\times A$.\n\n$p = \\frac{A}{0.988} = \\frac{A}{0.988} \\times \\frac{1}{1 - 0.988} = \\frac{A}{0.012}$\n\nTherefore, the value of $p$ is $p = 0.012$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
