My solution was:\n$$v = \\frac{h-k}{t} + 16 t$$\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The correct answer is:\n$$v = \\frac{h-k}{t} - 16 t$$\nExplanation:\nThe equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$ can be rearranged as $t=- \\frac{h}{v} + \\frac{k}{v}$. Substituting this into the equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$, we get $t=- \\frac{h}{v} + \\frac{k}{v} = - \\frac{h}{v} + \\frac{k}{v} + k$. Simplifying, we get $t = -\\frac{h}{v} + k$. Now, we can find $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ as follows: $v = \\frac{h}{t} - k$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B): $v = \\frac{h-k}{t}$."
