Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I will make sure to be more careful and accurate in my answer this time.\n\nTo determine which value will change the most if the 24-inch measurement is removed from the data, we need to calculate the mean, median, and range of the remaining data.\n\nThe mean of the remaining data is:\n8 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 75\n\nThe median of the remaining data is:\n9, 10, 12, 13 = 45\n\nThe range of the remaining data is:\n45\n\nTherefore, the range will change the most if the 24-inch measurement is removed from the data, as it is the largest value in the table.\n\nAnswer: C: Range"
