I need to use the formula $W=mg$ to find the weight of an object on Mercury.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe mass of the object is 90 kilograms, and the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury is 3.6 meters per second squared. Therefore, the weight of the object on Mercury is:\n\nW = mg\n= 90 kg x 3.6 m/s^2\n= 324 N\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) 86 newtons."
