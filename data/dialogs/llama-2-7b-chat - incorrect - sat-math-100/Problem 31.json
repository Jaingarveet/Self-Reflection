We know that:\n\n1 gram = 1,000 milligrams\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the number of milligrams in 2 decagrams as follows:\n\n2 decagrams = 2 x 1,000 milligrams = 2,000 milligrams\n\nNow, we are given that the hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers.\n\nSo, to find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container, we can divide the number of milligrams in the container by 1,000:\n\n2,000 milligrams / 1,000 = 2 doses\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
