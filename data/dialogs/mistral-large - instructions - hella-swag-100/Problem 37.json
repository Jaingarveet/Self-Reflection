[step] That's easier said than done, especially if you're subbing for someone, but being late throws you off balance. It flusters you.\nChoices:\n  A: Many schools assign teachers and students to class at that time. Being too late gives the bus driver extra time to reschedule.\n  B: Having sit-down comfort is key to keeping your focus sharp. [title] Grab an umbrella if it's sunny.\n  C: When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot.\n  D: So find ways to be consistent about staying on time.

However, this answer does not directly address the theme of maintaining focus or the implications of being late. Option D is a better answer because it directly addresses the theme of maintaining focus and the implications of being late by suggesting ways to stay on time and avoid distractions."
