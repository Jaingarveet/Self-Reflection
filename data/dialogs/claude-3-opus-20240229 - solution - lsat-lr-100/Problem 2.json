Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n2. This year, most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nAnalyzing the answer choices:\n[REDACTED]: Not necessarily true. The information is about Lac Nichoutec prize-winners, not all Canadian films at international festivals.\n[REDACTED]: Not necessarily true. The information doesn't indicate the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n[REDACTED]: Could be true, but not necessarily. If even one international prize-winner was not Canadian, this would be false.\n[REDACTED]: Must be true. If most (but not all) Lac Nichoutec winners won internationally, then at least one Lac Nichoutec winner must not have won internationally.\n[REDACTED]: Not necessarily true. It's possible that all international prize-winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nTherefore, [REDACTED] is the correct answer.\n"

This year, most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\n3. From these two facts, we can deduce that some Canadian films won prizes at international film festivals this year. If most Lac Nichoutec winners (which are all Canadian films) also won internationally, then it must be true that some Canadian films won at international festivals.\n4. Looking at the answer choices:\nA and B: These can't be inferred from the given information. We don't know about all Canadian films at international festivals or the proportion shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nC: This matches our deduction from step 3. If most Lac Nichoutec winners won internationally, then some international winners must have been Canadian.\nD and E: These aren't necessarily true. It's possible all Lac Nichoutec winners also won internationally and all international winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n5. Therefore, C is the only statement that must be true based on the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
