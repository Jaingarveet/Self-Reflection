        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love \"until death do us part.\" If \"love\" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. The argument states that if \"love\" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, the promise makes no sense.\n2. This is because feelings are outside one's control, and promising something outside one's control is nonsensical.\n3. The conclusion is that \"love\" in this context should not be taken to refer to feelings.\n4. For this conclusion to follow, we must assume that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The ethicist argues that if \"love\" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love until death makes no sense. This is because feelings are not within our control.\n2. The ethicist concludes that \"love\" in this context should not be taken to refer to feelings. \n3. For this conclusion to logically follow, there must be an unstated assumption. We need to identify that assumption among the answer choices.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   A) This is too broad. The argument doesn't require assuming none of our feelings are controllable.\n   B) This is promising. If people shouldn't make uncontrollable promises, that supports the conclusion.\n   C) This doesn't help the conclusion. Even if love can mean something else, that doesn't mean it can't mean feelings here.\n   D) This looks correct. If we assume promises shouldn't be nonsensical, then interpreting \"love\" as uncontrollable feelings would be ruled out.\n   E) This is similar to D but a bit stronger. The argument doesn't require assuming impossible promises are nonsensical, just that this particular interpretation would be nonsensical.\n5. Therefore, the best answer is D. The ethicist's conclusion relies on the assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
