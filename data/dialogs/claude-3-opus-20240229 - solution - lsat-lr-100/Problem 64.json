Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears\n  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon\n  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon\n  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe argument notes that human tears contain many of the same hormones that the body produces during emotional stress. It then asserts that because shedding tears removes these hormones from the body, crying must reduce emotional stress.\nHowever, the argument assumes that because stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of emotional stress. This is a flawed assumption. The mere presence of these hormones in tears when stress occurs does not necessarily mean that the hormones themselves cause the stress.\nIt's entirely possible that both the stress hormones and the emotional stress are effects of some other common cause, rather than the hormones causing the stress. The argument fails to consider this possibility and simply takes for granted that the presence of the hormones in tears means they are a cause of stress.\nTherefore, the reasoning is most vulnerable to the criticism that it [REDACTED].\n"
