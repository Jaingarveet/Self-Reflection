In a mixture, the substances retain their original properties and can be separated by physical means. \nThe snack consists of peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces. Each of these components maintains its original properties in the mixture:\n- The peanuts still look, feel, and taste like peanuts\n- The raisins still look, feel, and taste like raisins \n- The chocolate pieces still look, feel, and taste like chocolate\n- etc.\nThe components have not chemically bonded to form a new substance. They are only physically mixed and could be separated by sorting them based on their distinct properties.\nTherefore, the statement that best describes why the snack is a mixture is: \"[REDACTED]\"\n"
