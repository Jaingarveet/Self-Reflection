        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Randomization is a method used to assign research subjects to different treatment groups in a study.\n2. The purpose of randomization is to minimize bias and confounding variables, ensuring the groups are as similar as possible at the start of the study.\n3. For proper randomization, each subject must have an equal probability of being assigned to any of the treatment groups. \n4. Before the randomization occurs, the probability of a subject being assigned to a particular group is known. For example, if there are two groups, each subject has a 50% chance of being in either group.\n5. However, the actual group assignment for each subject is determined randomly during the randomization process. Before this occurs, it is unknown which specific group a subject will end up in.\n6. Therefore, randomization is best described as having \"Equal and unknown chances\". The probability of assignment to each group is equal and known beforehand, but the actual assigned group for each subject is unknown until randomization takes place.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
