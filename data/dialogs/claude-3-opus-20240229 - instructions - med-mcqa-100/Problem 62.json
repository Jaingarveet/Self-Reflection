The four main segments of the uterine tube (fallopian tube) are:\n   - Infundibulum: The funnel-shaped distal end near the ovary\n   - Ampulla: The widest and longest segment, making up about half the tube's length  \n   - Isthmus: The narrow segment between the ampulla and uterus\n   - Interstitial: The portion that passes through the uterine wall\n2. Visualizing the relative sizes:\n   - The infundibulum is funnel-shaped and wider than the isthmus\n   - The ampulla is the widest segment\n   - The isthmus is narrow compared to the ampulla\n   - The interstitial portion passes through the muscular uterine wall\n3. The segment with the smallest diameter is the interstitial portion. It must pass through the thick uterine wall, so it has the narrowest lumen (inner open space).\n4. The interstitial segment is the narrowest part of the uterine tube because of its location within the uterine wall.\n5. The answer choice corresponding to the interstitial segment is \"D\".\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
