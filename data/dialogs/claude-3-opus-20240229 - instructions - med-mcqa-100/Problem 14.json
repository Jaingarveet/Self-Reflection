Identify the metabolic pathway in question (glycolysis).\n2. Determine whether the conditions are aerobic or anaerobic.\n3. Recall the net production of ATP in glycolysis ([REDACTED]).\n4. Identify the steps in glycolysis where NAD+ is reduced to NADH.\n5. In anaerobic conditions, remember that NADH must be oxidized back to NAD+ to continue glycolysis.\n6. Recognize that the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ is coupled with the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.\n7. Conclude that the end products in anaerobic glycolysis are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question is asking about anaerobic glycolysis specifically.\n2. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose and produces pyruvate. It occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.\n3. In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate through a series of enzymatic reactions. This process produces a net of 2 ATP molecules.\n4. During glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH at the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase step. \n5. Under anaerobic conditions, the NADH produced must be oxidized back to NAD+ in order for glycolysis to continue, since NAD+ is required as an electron acceptor. \n6. To regenerate NAD+, NADH reduces pyruvate to lactate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This allows glycolysis to proceed in the absence of oxygen.\n7. Therefore, in anaerobic glycolysis, the end products are 2 ATP molecules and 2 molecules of NADH which get oxidized back to NAD+.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
