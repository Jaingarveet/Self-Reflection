Read the clinical scenario carefully, noting key information like gestational age and obstetric history.\n2. Identify the main clinical finding or problem, in this case, an unstable lie.\n3. Consider the potential causes of the clinical finding among the given options.\n4. Prioritize the most likely cause based on the clinical scenario and your knowledge of obstetrics.\n5.

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The key information is that this is a 34 week multigravida with 2 previous normal deliveries who now has an unstable lie. \n2. The main clinical finding is the unstable lie at 34 weeks gestation in an otherwise uncomplicated obstetric history.\n3. Looking at the potential causes:\nA) Oligohydramnios - Decreased amniotic fluid could allow the fetus more room to move into an unstable lie.\nB) Placenta previa - A low-lying placenta could prevent the fetus from settling into a stable lie.  \nC) Pelvic tumor - A mass in the pelvis may prevent the fetus from engaging in the pelvis in a stable lie.\nD) Uterine anomalies - An abnormally shaped uterus may make it difficult for the fetus to get into a stable lie.\n4. In a multigravida with previous normal deliveries, uterine anomalies are less likely since they probably would have affected the previous pregnancies as well. Pelvic tumors are relatively uncommon.\n5. While oligohydramnios can cause unstable lie, placenta previa is a more common cause, especially in a multigravida. The low-lying placenta prevents engagement of the presenting part.\n6. Therefore, placenta previa is the most likely cause of unstable lie in this clinical scenario.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
