        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The key radiologic sign mentioned is \"cobra snake head appearance\". I need to recall what this sign looks like and what it indicates.\n2. The cobra head sign refers to the bulbous dilatation of the distal ureter as it enters the bladder. It resembles a cobra's head with its hood extended. This occurs due to obstruction or blockage of the ureteral orifice.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A. Rectocele - This is a herniation of the rectum into the vagina. It would not cause the cobra head sign.\n   B. Ureterocele - A ureterocele is a congenital cystic dilation of the distal ureter within the bladder. The ballooning of the distal ureter can resemble a cobra head.\n   C. Posterior urethral valve - These are obstructing membranous folds in the male posterior urethra. They can cause bladder and ureteral dilation but not the specific cobra head appearance. \n   D. Bladder tumour - A bladder tumour would not typically cause the focal distal ureteral dilation seen in the cobra head sign.\n4. I can eliminate choices A, C, and D as they do not classically present with the cobra head sign.\n5. Ureterocele (choice B) is the condition that most closely matches the \"cobra snake head appearance\" finding, as it represents a cystic dilation of the distal ureter.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
