The key terms in the question are \"senescent RBCs\" (referring to older red blood cells) and the different types of malaria (vivax, ovale, falciparum, and quartan).\n2. Recalling the specific red blood cell preferences of each malaria parasite species:\n   - Plasmodium malariae, which causes quartan malaria, prefers to infect senescent (older) RBCs.\n   - Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale prefer to infect younger RBCs.\n3. The question asks which type of malaria mainly attacks senescent RBCs. Based on the information recalled in step 2, quartan malaria, caused by P. malariae, is the type that prefers senescent RBCs.\n4. Double-checking the answer: Quartan malaria matches the specific parasite-host cell association mentioned in the question, as P. malariae targets senescent RBCs.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
