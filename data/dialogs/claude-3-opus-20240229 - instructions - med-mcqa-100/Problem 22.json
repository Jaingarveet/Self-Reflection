Reviewing the key researchers:\n   - Kim has made contributions to root canal anatomy, but I don't recall an isthmus classification.\n   - Schielder is known for root canal preparation techniques, but not isthmus classification.\n   - Vertucci developed a classification for root canal configurations, but it's not specific to isthmuses.\n   - Krasner and Rankow developed a classification system specifically for root canal isthmuses.\n3. The key feature mentioned in the question is the \"isthmus classification\". This matches the work of Krasner and Rankow.\n4. Eliminating choices:\n   - Kim, Schielder, and Vertucci can be eliminated as their work does not focus on isthmus classification.\n5. The answer that best fits the isthmus classification mentioned in the question is Krasner and Rankow.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
