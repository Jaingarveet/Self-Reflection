It involves an exaggerated immune response to allergens.\n2. The main types of hypersensitivity reactions are:\n   Type I - Immediate, IgE-mediated \n   Type II - Antibody-mediated cytotoxicity\n   Type III - Immune complex-mediated  \n   Type IV - Delayed, cell-mediated\n3. Spring catarrh primarily involves two hypersensitivity reaction types:\n   - Type I (immediate, IgE-mediated): Mast cell degranulation causes acute symptoms\n   - Type IV (delayed, cell-mediated): T-cell mediated chronic inflammation \n4. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A: b - Only lists Type II, which is incorrect\n   B: ad - Lists both Type I and IV, which matches the pathophysiology\n   C: ac - Includes Type III, which is not a major component \n   D: ab - Includes Type II but omits Type IV\n5. The answer choice that most accurately represents the hypersensitivity types in spring catarrh is B (ad), as it correctly includes both Type I and Type IV reactions.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
