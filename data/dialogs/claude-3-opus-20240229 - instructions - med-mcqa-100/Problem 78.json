It courses along the side of the face, deep to the platysma muscle, and along the side of the nose. \n3. Named branches of the facial artery include the superior and inferior labial arteries, lateral nasal artery, and angular artery.\n4. The terminal branch of the facial artery is the angular artery, which courses along the side of the nose up to the medial corner of the eye.\n5. At its terminal end near the medial corner of the eye, the angular artery anastomoses with a branch of the ophthalmic artery. \n6. The ophthalmic artery originates from the internal carotid artery, which is a terminal branch of the common carotid artery.\nTherefore, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which originates from the internal carotid artery.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
