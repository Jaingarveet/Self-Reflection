Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. We know that B bisects minor arc AC.\nWe can draw a line from point B to the midpoint of arc AC, and label it as point M.\nSince B bisects minor arc AC, we know that:\nAngular distance ABM = Angular distance CMB\n\nWe can also see that:\nAngular distance ABM = (Angular distance AC) / 2\nAngular distance CMB = (Angular distance BC) / 2\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion:\n(Angular distance AC) / 2 = (Angular distance BC) / 2\n160° / 2 = 150° / 2\n80° = 75°\n\nSince the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BC, we have:\nMinor arc AD = 160° - 150° = 10°\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
