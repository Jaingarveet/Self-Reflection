The remaining 19% (100% - 81%) are not squashed.\n4. Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 10% of the 19% that are not squashed are also cocoa flavored.\n5. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 19% - 10% = 9%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
