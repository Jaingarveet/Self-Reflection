If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again?\nChoices:\n  A: 272 minutes\n  B: 304 minutes\n  C: 190 minutes\n  D: 70 minutes\n  E: 35 minutes\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of least common multiple (LCM). I thought that the LCM of 16 and 17 was 112, when in fact it is 272. This led me to calculate the wrong time for when both trains would leave simultaneously again.\n"

To find when both trains will leave simultaneously again, I will divide 272 by 16 and 17.\n\n272 / 16 = 17\n272 / 17 = 16\n\nTherefore, Train A and Train B will leave simultaneously again in 16 minutes and 17 minutes, respectively.\n\nThe correct answer is 272 minutes, which is choice A."
