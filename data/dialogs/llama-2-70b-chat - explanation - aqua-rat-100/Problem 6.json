Therefore, the total time taken by all three persons to paint 3 houses would be 6 + 8 + 12 = 26 days.\nSince Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, Mr. Black will work for 6 days. Therefore, the total time taken by Mr. Black to paint 3 houses would be 8 + 6 = 14 days.\nNow, Mr. Blue will take 12 - 6 = 6 days to complete the remaining work.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
