I used the formula (M + N) / 2, which is the formula for finding the average of two speeds, not the average speed for both activities combined.\n\nThe correct formula for finding the average speed for both activities combined is (M + N) / 4. This is because the athlete spends the same amount of time doing both activities, so the total distance traveled should be divided by the total time taken.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (M + N) / 4, which is choice C."
