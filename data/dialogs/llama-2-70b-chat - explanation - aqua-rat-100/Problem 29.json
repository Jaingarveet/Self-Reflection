I divided 30 by 1, which is the net movement upward in one day, instead of dividing 30 by 3, which is the total movement upward in one day.\nThe frog moves 3m up and 2m down, so the net movement upward is 1m per day.\nTherefore, it will take 30 days for the frog to come out of the well.\nThe correct answer is B: 26 days.\nI'll be more careful in my calculations in the future."
