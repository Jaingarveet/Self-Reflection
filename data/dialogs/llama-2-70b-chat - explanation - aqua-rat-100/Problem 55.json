However, the question is asking for the rate along the current, which is not the average of the two rates.\n\nTo find the rate along the current, we need to add the rate in still water and the rate against the current. The rate in still water is 4 kmph, and the rate against the current is 2 kmph. Therefore, the rate along the current is 4 + 2 = 6 kmph.\n\nSo, the correct answer is choice B: 6 kmph."
