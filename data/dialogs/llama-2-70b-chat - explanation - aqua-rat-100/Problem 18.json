I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the percentage increase incorrectly.\nAfter reflecting on the problem, I realized that I needed to use the formula: Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price.\nUsing this formula, I was able to calculate the correct percentage increase, which is 42.86%.\nI learned that it's important to carefully read the question and use the correct formula to solve the problem. I also learned that reflection is an important part of the learning process, as it allows me to identify my mistakes and improve my understanding of the topic."
