After the first time replacing 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk, the concentration of tea becomes 85% (50% - 15% = 85%). Then, replacing 10% of the resultant solution with more milk reduces the concentration of tea to 76.5% (85% - 10% = 76.5%). Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 76.5%.\n\nThe correct answer is C: 39.86%.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this answer is helpful."
