I incorrectly solved for x in the equation 2x - 8 = 4x. I misunderstood the equation and wrote 2x = 4x + 8 instead of 2x - 8 = 4x.\n\nThe correct solution is as follows:\nLet x be the length of one side of the square.\nThe perimeter of the square is 4x.\nThe area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the original square is 2 \\* 70 = 140 square feet.\nThe equation 2x - 8 = 4x represents the fact that the trimmed edge of the square is 4 feet less than the original side length, so we can set up the equation:\n2x - 8 = 4x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n2x - 8 = 4x\n2x = 4x + 8\n2x - 4x = 8\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the original square is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet.\n\nThe correct answer is B: 58."
