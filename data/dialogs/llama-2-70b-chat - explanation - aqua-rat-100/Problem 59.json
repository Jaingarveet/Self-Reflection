Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 was black.\n3. The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag.\n\nFrom step 3, we can infer that the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 or 5%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of marbles in the bag:\n\nTotal number of marbles = Number of black marbles + Number of white marbles\n\nWe know that the number of black marbles is 5% of the total number of marbles, so we can calculate it as follows:\n\nNumber of black marbles = 5% of total number of marbles\n\nSubstituting the value of 5% for the percentage, we get:\n\nNumber of black marbles = 5/100 x total number of marbles\n\nNow, we can solve for the total number of marbles:\n\nTotal number of marbles = Number of black marbles / 5/100\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nTotal number of marbles = 100 x Number of black marbles\n\nSince there are 20 black marbles, we can substitute this value:\n\nTotal number of marbles = 100 x 20\n\nTotal number of marbles = 2000\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 2000.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
