I misunderstood the question and thought that the number of friends who attended the picnic was x - 4, instead of x.\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\nThe total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.\nSince four friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is x - 4.\nEach of the remaining friends had to contribute an extra Rs. 4, so the total amount spent by them is (x - 4) x 4 = 4x - 16.\nSince the total amount spent on eatables is Rs. 96, we can set up the equation:\n4x - 16 = 96\nSolving for x, we get:\n4x = 96 + 16\n4x = 112\nx = 112/4\nx = 28\nTherefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 28.\nThe correct answer is B: 12.\nI apologize for my previous mistake and I'm confident in my new answer."
