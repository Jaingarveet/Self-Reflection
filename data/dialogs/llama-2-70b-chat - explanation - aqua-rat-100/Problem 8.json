The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?\nChoices:\n  A: 126\n  B: 77\n  C: 88\n  D: 66\n  E: 54\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and wrote the equation for the bus fare incorrectly. I also made a mistake in simplifying the equation.\n\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n\nThe train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is [REDACTED], not 94.\n\nThe correct equation is:\n\nBus fare = (4/3) * Train fare\n\nThe total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6 * Bus fare = 6 * (4/3) * Train fare = 8 * Train fare.\n\nThe total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8 * Train fare.\n\nThe total fare paid by both groups is Rs.1512, so we can set up the equation:\n\n8 * Train fare + 8 * Train fare = 1512\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n16 * Train fare = 1512\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\n\nTrain fare = [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is Rs.[REDACTED].\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\n---\n"
