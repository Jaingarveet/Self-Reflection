In young children, the donor site for split skin grafts should be carefully selected to minimize scarring and maximize healing.\n\nThe buttocks and thigh are common donor sites for split skin grafts in adults, but they may not be the best choice for young children due to the risk of scarring and potential for functional impairment. The trunk is also not an ideal donor site in young children due to the risk of scarring and potential for cosmetic deformity.\n\nThe upper limb, specifically the anterior aspect of the forearm, is a commonly used donor site for split skin grafts in young children. This site is typically well-vascularized and heals well, with minimal scarring and functional impairment.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
