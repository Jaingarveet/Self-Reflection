An increased ESR is a non-specific indicator of inflammation or tissue damage.\n\nSickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder that causes red blood cells to become misshapen and break down, leading to anemia and other complications. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell. Polycythemia is a condition in which there is an overproduction of red blood cells. Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to fluid buildup in the body.\n\nIncreased ESR is seen in sickle cell anemia and multiple myeloma, but not in polycythemia or congestive heart failure.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\") and (\"B\")\n\nNote: The question asks for the condition in which increased ESR is seen, not the condition that causes increased ESR. Therefore, both sickle cell anemia and multiple myeloma are correct answers."
