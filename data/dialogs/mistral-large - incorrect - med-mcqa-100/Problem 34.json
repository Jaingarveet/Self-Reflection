This type of reaction is mediated by IgE antibodies and involves the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils.\n\nThe four types of hypersensitivity reactions are:\n\n* Type I: immediate hypersensitivity, mediated by IgE antibodies and involving the release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils.\n* Type II: cytotoxic hypersensitivity, mediated by IgG or IgM antibodies and involving the destruction of target cells.\n* Type III: immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity, mediated by the formation of immune complexes and involving the activation of complement and inflammatory cells.\n* Type IV: delayed-type hypersensitivity, mediated by T cells and involving the activation of macrophages and other inflammatory cells.\n\nBased on this information, spring catarrh is a type I hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
