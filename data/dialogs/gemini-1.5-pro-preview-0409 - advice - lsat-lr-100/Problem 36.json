The argument focuses on the **perception** of sound, not the ability to understand meaning. Whether or not an uninterrupted stream of sound can be understood is irrelevant to the argument's claim that the perception of distinct words is an illusion.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n*   **A**: As discussed, this is irrelevant to the perception of sound.\n*   **B**: This contradicts the premise that travelers hear an \"uninterrupted stream of sound.\"\n*   **C**: The argument doesn't compare the level of attention paid to familiar and unfamiliar languages.\n*   **D**: This introduces information about non-native speakers, which is not discussed in the argument.\n*   **E**: This aligns with the argument's point that the perception of distinct words is an illusion, implying that native speakers' perception is not inherently more accurate.\n## Conclusion:\nThe assumption the argument relies on is that the perception of native speakers is not inherently more accurate than that of non-speakers. \n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
