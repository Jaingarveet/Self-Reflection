Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

My reasoning was that if victims of theft and bribery experience similar levels of harm, it would support the argument that the crimes deserve equal penalties. However, this was flawed because the argument's basis is the lawmakers' perception of harm, not the actual harm experienced.\nThe correct answer, **Answer(\"A\")**, strengthens the argument by establishing a general principle that lawmakers use to determine penalties. If they typically base penalties on perceived harm, then their decision to give equal penalties for theft and bribery suggests they believe the harms are equal. \n## Applying the Learning:\nTherefore, when analyzing arguments about lawmakers' intentions, it's crucial to focus on their perceived justifications for actions rather than external factors or consequences. \n"
