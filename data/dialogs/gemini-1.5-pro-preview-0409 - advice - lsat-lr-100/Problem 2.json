        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I incorrectly chose option A. This was due to a misinterpretation of the relationship between the statements. I focused on the success of Canadian films at international festivals and assumed it implied the reverse was also true. However, the context only establishes that **some prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals**, not that all or most did.\n## Applying Learnings:\nConsidering the context and my previous error, I should focus on statements that directly relate to the given information and avoid assumptions about the reverse relationship.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n* **A:** This reverses the given relationship and is not necessarily true. \n* **B:** This makes an assumption about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec, which is not supported by the context.\n* **C:** This directly aligns with the given information. If some films from Lac Nichoutec won at international festivals, then some prize-winners at international festivals must be Canadian.\n* **D & E:** These options discuss films that did not win at both types of festivals, which is not relevant to the given information about films that did win at both.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
