The correct answer is (C) 450 acres.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, we need to use the information provided in the problem. The area of a football field is approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres, and we know that a sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. Therefore, we can calculate the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene as follows:\n\n$ \\text {Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene} = \\text {Area of one football field} \\times \\text {Number of football fields covered by 1 ounce of graphene} $\n\n$ \\text {Area of one football field} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text {acres} $\n\n$ \\text {Number of football fields covered by 1 ounce of graphene} = 7 $\n\nNow, we can plug in the values to get the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene:\n\n$ \\text {Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text {acres} \\times 7 = \\frac{21}{3} \\text {acres} $\n\nFinally, we can convert the area to acres by dividing by 40 (since there are 40 acres in one acre):\n\n$ \\text {Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene} = \\frac{21}{3} \\text {acres} \\div 40 = 52.5 \\text {acres} $\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 450 acres.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
