I correctly identified that $r = 6$ based on the given equation $3r = 18$, but then I made an error in my calculation for $6r + 3$.\n\nThe correct calculation for $6r + 3$ is:\n\n$6r + 3 = 6(6) + 3 = 39$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) $39$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Miscalculation\n* Mistake\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with simple arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication.\n* Use a step-by-step approach to ensure that you are correctly applying the mathematical operations.\n* Verify your answers by checking them against the correct solution.\n\nIn this case, I should have double-checked my calculation for $6r + 3$ to ensure that it was correct. By following the advice above, I can avoid making similar mistakes in the future.\n"
