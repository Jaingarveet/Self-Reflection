        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Mr. Kohl has a beaker containing $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute to the students in his chemistry class. If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nYou are correct that the number of students in the class is 21. However, your reasoning for arriving at that answer is not correct. Here's why:\n\nYou said that if Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. So, the total amount of solution he has is 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters, where n is the number of students.\n\nBut that's not the correct equation. The equation should be:\n\nTotal amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters\n\nSo, if Mr. Kohl wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. Therefore, the total amount of solution he needs is:\n\nTotal amount of solution = 5 milliliters + (n-3) milliliters + 21 milliliters = 26 milliliters\n\nSince he has 5 milliliters left over after giving 3 milliliters to each student, he must have had a total of 26 milliliters - 5 milliliters = 21 milliliters of solution to start with.\n\nSo, the number of students in the class is indeed 21.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion. Thank you for sharing your thought process!\n"
