Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $x-2$\n  B: $x-3$\n  C: $x-4$\n  D: $x-5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (C) $x-4$.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Constant term: $f(0) = 3$.\n2. Degree of the polynomial: The degree of the polynomial is 1, since the highest power of $x$ is 1.\n3. Factors of the polynomial: A polynomial of degree 1 can be factored as $x - r$, where $r$ is a constant.\n\nUsing these steps, we can determine that the factor of $f(x)$ must be $x - 4$.\n\nThe table provided shows that $f(2) = 1$ and $f(4) = 0$, which matches the factor $x - 4$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) $x-4$.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Use the given information to determine the factor of the polynomial.\n* Identify the constant term and degree of the polynomial.\n* Use the steps provided to determine the factor of the polynomial.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that the factor of a polynomial can be a constant or a linear expression.\n"
