However, the simplified expression you arrived at, $\\frac{2x+5}{x^{2}+5x+6}$, is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (B): $\\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.\n\nHere's how you can arrive at the correct answer:\n\nUsing the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction, we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{x+2}{x+3} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+2}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by combining the like terms:\n\n$$\\frac{x+2}{x+3} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+2} = \\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): $\\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* When simplifying expressions, always use the appropriate formulas and techniques to arrive at the simplified form.\n* When dealing with fractions, use the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction to simplify the expression.\n* Always check your work by verifying that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original expression.\n"
