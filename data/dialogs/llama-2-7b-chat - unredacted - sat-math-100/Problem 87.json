The equation of the parabola is $y=(x-11)^2$, and it intersects the line $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. To find the length of $\\overline{A B}$, we need to use the distance formula, which is $ \\sqrt {(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2} $.\n\nReflection:\nI realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. I mistakenly used the equation of the line $y=25$ instead of the equation of the parabola. Thankfully, I caught the error and corrected it.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe length of $\\overline{A B}$ is $ \\sqrt {(10 - 5)^2 + (25 - 10)^2} = 12 $."
