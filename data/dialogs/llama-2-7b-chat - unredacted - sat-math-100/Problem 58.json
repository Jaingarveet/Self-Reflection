Since $y > x + b$ at this point, we have $b > a$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation of the problem\n* Incorrect reasoning\n* Wrong answer\n\nSolution:\n\n1.

However, upon further examination, I realized that the correct relationship is $b > a$.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the point of intersection between the two lines given in the problem, $y = -x + a$ and $y = x + b$. Using the point of intersection $(0,0)$, we can check the inequality conditions.\n\nAt $(0,0)$, we have $y > x + b$ and $y < -x + a$. Since $y > x + b$ is the given condition, we can set $y = x + b$ in the first inequality to get $a < -x + b$. Therefore, the relationship between $a$ and $b$ is $b > a$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation of the problem\n* Incorrect reasoning\n* Wrong answer\n\nSolution:\n\n1.
