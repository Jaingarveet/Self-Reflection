If b = c - $\\frac{1}{2}$, then we can solve for x and y using the first equation:\n\n3x + b = 5x - 7\n3x = 5x - 7 + b\n3x = 12\n\nNow, substituting this value of x into the second equation:\n\n3y + c = 5y - 7\n3y = 5y - 7 + c\n3y = 12 + c\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 12 + c / 3\n\nNow, you were given the following choices:\n\nA: x is y minus 1/4\nB: x is y minus 1/2\nC: x is y minus 1\nD: x is y plus 1/2\n\nYou correctly identified that the correct answer is (B): $x$ is $y$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWell done!\n"
