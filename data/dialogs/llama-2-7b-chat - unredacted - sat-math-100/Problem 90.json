If the present population of the city is 50,000, which of the following expressions represents the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now?\nChoices:\n  A: $50,000(0.1)^{20 t}$\n  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$\n  C: $50,000(0.9)^{20 t}$\n  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$.\n\nThe engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now can be represented by a linear decay function, as the population is expected to decrease by 10% every 20 years. This means that the population will decrease at a constant rate, which can be represented by the formula:\n\nPopulation ($t$ years from now) = Population present ($50,000$) x (1 - 0.10^t)\n\nWhere t is the number of years from the present.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\\frac{t}{20}}$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Linear decay function\n* Constant rate of change\n* Population growth model\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the pattern in the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now.\n2. Choose the correct formula to represent the population growth model.\n3. Plug in the value of t (20 years from the present) to find the estimated population.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the population growth model can be represented by different formulas, such as linear decay functions or exponential functions, depending on the specific pattern of growth.\n"
