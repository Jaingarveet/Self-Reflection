The graph of the equation in the $x y$-plane is a parabola with vertex $(c, d)$. Which of the following is equal to $d$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $-9 a$\n  B: $-8 a$\n  C: $-5 a$\n  D: $-2 a$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly identified the quadratic equation as $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$ and factored it to isolate $a$. However, I made an error in my calculation of the value of $d$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Factoring error\n* Calculation error\n* Coordinate error\n\nSolution:\nThe quadratic equation $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$ can be factored as $y = a(x-2)(x+4) = a(x-2)(0 + 4) = a(x-2)4$. Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the quadratic equation and factor it to isolate $a$.\n2. Set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.\n3. Identify the vertex of the parabola and calculate the value of $d$.\n4. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always check your work by setting the equation to $y = 0$ and solving for $x$.\n* Be careful when factoring quadratic expressions to ensure that you are factoring correctly.\n* Use the correct coordinate system when plotting the graph of the parabola.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n"
