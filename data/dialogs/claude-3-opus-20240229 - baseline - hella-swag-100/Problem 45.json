[step] Traditionally, softball players use what's called the four-seam grip. This grip consists of the index, middle, and ring finger and requires you to grip the ball perpendicular to the seams, with your fingertips across the top of the \" c \" or horseshoe pattern.\nChoices:\n  A: Your thumb should grip the seams on the underside of the ball below your index finger. [substeps] Always hold the softball with the tips of your fingers and avoid \" palming \" the ball.\n  B: Your index and middle fingers should form a right angle between the seam and the grip. [title] Hold the ball far away from your body.\n  C: Grips like this are particularly useful if you're practicing in an enclosed area. [substeps] For a palm-to-palm grip, place your index or middle finger on the inside seam.\n  D: In most jurisdictions, this grip includes both the right-hand and left-hand positions. The four-seam grip focuses on : [substeps] Shooting: your thumb should be resting on the handle of the softball cup.\n"

It is relevant to the topic of gripping the softball properly.\nB) While this choice mentions finger placement, the idea of forming a right angle seems inconsistent with the perpendicular grip described earlier. Holding the ball far from the body is a separate point that doesn't directly relate to the grip.\nC) Practicing in an enclosed area is not directly relevant to the four-seam grip. The palm-to-palm grip seems to be a different grip altogether, not a continuation of the four-seam grip description.\nD) Mentioning jurisdictions and shooting seems out of place in the context of gripping a softball for playing outfield. The information does not flow logically from the previous text.\nBased on this analysis, choice A provides the most coherent and relevant continuation of the text about gripping the softball properly for playing outfield.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
