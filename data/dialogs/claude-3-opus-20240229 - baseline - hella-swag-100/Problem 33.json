This is unlikely to be correct.\nB: Static and agitator coils are not typically part of a dryer, and this step doesn't follow logically from unplugging the dryer for safety. This is also unlikely to be correct.\nC: Specifying the location of the plug is somewhat relevant, but running the dryer on \"neutral mode\" after unplugging it doesn't make sense. Dryers don't have a neutral mode, and you wouldn't run it after unplugging for safety. This is probably not correct.\nD: Testing to ensure you've unplugged the dryer correctly is a logical safety precaution that follows unplugging the dryer. Additionally, shutting off the gas for a gas dryer is another important safety step before cleaning the dryer drum. This choice makes the most sense in the context of the question.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
