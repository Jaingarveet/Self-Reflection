The previous steps involved preheating the oven, preparing the cake pan, and mixing butter, sugar, and eggs. Logically, the next steps would involve adding the dry ingredients (like flour) and the signature ingredients of a simnel cake (dried/candied fruits). Then, the batter would be poured into the prepared pan for baking.\nAmong the choices, option D follows this logical progression of steps for making a cake batter. The other options mention steps that don't make sense in the context of the recipe, like dipping the pan in melted butter or spreading cream over the pan.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
