The given text explains that in binary, 1 represents \"on\" and 0 represents \"off\".\n2. It then instructs to choose a binary number to decode and give each digit a value, starting from the rightmost digit.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\n   - Choice A provides an example of assigning values to each digit, doubling the value for each position from right to left (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64). This matches the standard method for decoding binary numbers.\n   - Choices B, C, and D do not make sense in the context of decoding binary numbers. They mention concepts like decimal places, fractions, and denominators which are not relevant.\n4. Therefore, choice A is the most logical and correct completion of the given text.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
