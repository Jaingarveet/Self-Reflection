Your dog may not know what you want or how you will react if they do something.\nChoices:\n  A: If you are busy with work and are away from home, time will slip away from your dog and ruin their routine. [substeps] Not knowing what you want or how you will react may cause them to have a hard time adjusting to being patient.\n  B: This delay is why it's important to always be consistent with your commands. [substeps] Try letting your dog know there are positive things they can do and make sure you reward them each time they do something right.\n  C: By being consistently patient, you help keep your dog from getting confused. [substeps] For example, if you are patient one day while doing something with them, but then yell and get frustrated the next day, the dog will be confused and not know how to act.\n  D: Make sure your dog knows what you want before you begin.

It also suggests the dog will have a hard time adjusting to being patient, which doesn't make sense.\nB: This choice emphasizes the importance of consistently giving commands and rewarding good behavior, which is relevant to being patient and helping the dog understand what is expected. The substeps provide a concrete suggestion for encouraging good behavior.\nC: This choice directly explains how being consistently patient helps prevent the dog from getting confused. The example illustrates how inconsistent reactions (patient one day, frustrated the next) will confuse the dog. This logically follows the initial text and expands on the importance of consistency.\nD: While letting the dog know what you want is important, this choice doesn't clearly connect to the idea of being consistent or patient. The substeps about giving the dog patience to follow you don't provide a clear or complete thought.\nBased on this analysis, choice C provides the most relevant and logical completion of the given text. It directly addresses the importance of consistent patience and provides a clear example to illustrate the point.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
