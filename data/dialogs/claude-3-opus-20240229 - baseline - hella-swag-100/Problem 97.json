This aligns with the scene of multiple kites flying and adds relevant details.\nChoice B mentions more kites and people getting ready, which could fit the scene but is less specific than A.\nChoices C and D mention kites being displayed throughout the land or with people standing around them, which doesn't fit as well with kites already flying in the sky over a sandy area.\nTherefore, choice A appears to be the most likely and natural completion of the given text.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
