It flusters you.\nChoices:\n  A: Many schools assign teachers and students to class at that time. Being too late gives the bus driver extra time to reschedule.\n  B: Having sit-down comfort is key to keeping your focus sharp.

The given text emphasizes the importance of being on time to the bus, as being late can make the driver flustered and throw them off balance.\n3. Looking at the choices:\n   - A is not relevant to maintaining focus while driving.\n   - B mentions sit-down comfort, which is not directly related to being on time. The part about grabbing an umbrella if it's sunny also doesn't make sense.\n   - C logically follows the given text by explaining why being late and flustered is problematic - it can lead to not thinking clearly and not being totally focused, which can result in accidents.\n   - D suggests finding ways to stay on time, but the specific example of counting out loud seems less relevant to the main point.\n4. Choice C provides the most coherent and relevant continuation of the given text by directly linking being late and flustered to reduced focus and potential accidents.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
