[step] If this is your first time dancing, don't try out complicated moves you might have seen in a music video. No one is expecting you to do so, and many of your classmates are probably thinking too much about how they look themselves.\nChoices:\n  A: Avoid trying out other moves or movements that all of your peers are unfamiliar with. Don't use these movements as excuses as they may be too awkward.\n  B: Start building up your confidence and learn some of the moves before you try them out. Maybe you know what to do better than the person dancing to your right.\n  C: [substeps] Try to blend in by mimicking your classmates' movements. Most djs at your middle school dance will probably play simple, high energy songs with an identifiable rhythm.\n  D: Instead, try dancing with your hands or open arms as the band starts to play.

The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text, which is advice for dancing at a middle school dance for the first time.\n2. The given text suggests keeping things simple and not trying complicated moves, as it's the first dance and many classmates are probably self-conscious too.\n3. Looking at the choices:\n   - A suggests avoiding unfamiliar moves, but the phrasing is a bit awkward and unclear.\n   - B suggests building confidence and learning moves beforehand, which doesn't directly follow the advice of keeping things simple.\n   - C suggests blending in by mimicking classmates' movements and notes that the DJ will likely play simple, high energy songs. This logically follows the advice of keeping things simple for a first dance.\n   - D suggests dancing with hands or open arms, which is a bit off-topic and doesn't directly complete the given text.\n4. Choice C provides the most relevant and logical completion to the given text by elaborating on how to keep things simple at a first middle school dance.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
