In this event, competitors lift a heavy barbell from the ground to above their head in one continuous motion. After each competitor completes their lift, they receive a score based on their performance.\nThe most likely completion should describe what happens after each competitor finishes their lift in a snatch competition.\nA: High jumps are not part of a snatch competition, so this is incorrect.\nB: This choice describes what happens at the end of the competition when medals are awarded, not after each individual lift.\nC: Shaking hands and saluting after each lift is not a common practice in weightlifting competitions.\nD: Competitors do not typically bow or place the barbell on their shoulders after a snatch lift.\nThe best answer should describe the competitor walking away after completing their lift and receiving a score. None of the provided choices accurately describe this, but choice B is the closest as it at least mentions the competition ending and competitors being recognized for their performance.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
