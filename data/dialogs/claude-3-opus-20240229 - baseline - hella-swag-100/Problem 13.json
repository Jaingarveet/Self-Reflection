Given that the subtopic is \"Cleaning windows\", the most probable scenario is that the man is demonstrating how to clean windows.\nWhen cleaning windows, a person typically uses various tools such as a squeegee, sponge, or cleaning solution. They would then proceed to clean the windows while on the ladder.\nThe other choices involving a Rubik's cube, piecing tools together, changing clothes, or showing his back do not logically fit the context of cleaning windows.\nTherefore, the most likely completion is that the man holds up various window cleaning tools and begins using them to clean the windows.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
