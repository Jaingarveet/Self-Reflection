[step] A good place to learn the ins and outs of the dog walking business is under someone who is already in it. Look for a large, local dog walking agency and contact the people there to ask if they need any help.\nChoices:\n  A: Additionally, talk to close friends who also tend to work in dog walking positions. Keep in mind that several companies have hired dog walkers in the past and you may be able to conduct an additional background check to determine if your company is accepting permits.\n  B: [substeps] Keep in mind, however, that you can start your own business already, which may seem like a lot of work to have. [title] Find a place where you can spend a lot of time.\n  C: This can be a way to both learn about the business and animal safety. [substeps] In the long run, this is often the best path to your own business.\n  D: Some dogs are exceedingly talented in their own ways.

The second sentence about finding a place to spend time also doesn't make sense in this context.\nC: This choice logically follows the previous text by explaining that working for an agency can help you learn about the business and animal safety, which are important for eventually starting your own dog walking business. The substeps provide a relevant long-term perspective.\nD: The first sentence about talented dogs is not directly relevant. Giving up work to see what a professional agency needs also contradicts the initial advice.\nChoice C is the most coherent and relevant completion, as it expands on the benefits of starting by working for an agency and connects this to the longer-term goal of starting your own business.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
