[step] Treating the ink stain immediately will make removing the stain much easier. If the ink stain is recent and hasn't set into the material, blot the ink stain with a cloth or paper towel before using any cleaning method.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] The ink stain is shallow and should be gradually removed. Blotting towels and paper towels will not get the ink stain out.\n  B: [title] Place a first-aid kit inside a size-appropriate bag. [step] If ink stain removers are not readily available on shelves, store your cheap silk dress inside a larger bag or in a bag with an elastic top.\n  C: [substeps] If you have any paper towels you can use, as well as the paper towel, blotting on the stain. The blot won't remove the ink stain, but it will prevent the ink from collecting.\n  D: Blotting the stain will absorb the excess ink from the dress so that the stain is easier to remove.
