The question describes a group of boys doing a drill involving running in an X formation and throwing a ball to each other diagonally.\n2. Choice A mentions splitting into teams and hitting the ball to one side of the field, which doesn't logically follow from the drill described.\n3. Choice B mentions playing rock paper scissors with batons and waving toward a stage, which seems completely unrelated to the hurling drill.\n4. Choice C mentions the game being over and people walking back, smiling and waving to a camera. This also doesn't fit with the drill scenario, and a camera isn't mentioned.\n5. Choice D states that after the drill is complete, the boys form a huddle and begin talking. This is the most logical next step after finishing a team drill - the team gathering to debrief or discuss the next steps.\nTherefore, choice D is the most likely and sensible completion to the given text.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
