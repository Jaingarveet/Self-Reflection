[step] You can slice in rounds or lengths; the preference is yours but round slices tend to be easier to handle. [title] Soak in salted water for 10 minutes.\nChoices:\n  A: [step] This is to insure that they don't taste salty. [title] Carefully pour the chicken stock over the eggplant slices.\n  B: [step] Remove the eggplant from the water and allow to sit in the salted water for 30 minutes. Then remove from the water and wring out the excess liquid.\n  C: [step] The cooking time varies; you can cover the dish with something like a lid or spread olive oil over the top; however, for this recipe , 2 to 3 minutes of added cooking time should be fine. [title] Drain the eggplant in a colander.\n  D: [substeps] Drain after 10 minutes and leave to one side for later use. [title] Beat the egg with a quarter teaspoon of fine salt.\n"

Pouring chicken stock over the eggplant seems unrelated to making fritters.\nB: Soaking for 10 minutes is already mentioned, so soaking for an additional 30 minutes seems excessive and unnecessary.\nC: The cooking time and method seem out of place, as the eggplant hasn't been coated in batter or fried yet. Draining the eggplant after soaking makes sense, but this choice includes irrelevant information.\nD: Draining the eggplant after soaking for 10 minutes is a logical next step. Beating the egg with salt is a common step in making a batter for fritters.\nTherefore, choice D seems to be the most likely and logical completion of the given text.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
