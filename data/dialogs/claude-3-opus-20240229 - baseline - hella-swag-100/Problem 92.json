Choice A mentions another man with a different machine, which seems unrelated and unlikely given the setup.\n3. Choice B suggests the boy tries again but has to solve it alone. This could be possible, but doesn't provide a strong conclusion to the scene.\n4. Choice C describes the boy solving the cube and showing his time to the camera. This makes sense as a typical ending to this kind of video challenge.\n5. Choice D has the boy showing off the solved cube while still speaking. This is also plausible, but less likely than showing his solve time as the key result.\nConsidering these options, C seems like the most natural and likely completion to the described video.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
