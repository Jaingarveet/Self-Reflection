They are holding onto each other, suggesting they may not be very experienced skaters.\n3. As they try to skate while holding each other, it's likely that their balance will be thrown off.\n4. With their balance compromised, the most probable outcome is that one of the girls will fall.\n5. If one girl falls while holding the other, the other girl will likely try to help her friend, but may also lose balance in the process.\nTherefore, the most likely completion to the given text is choice D: \"falls down while the other tries to help.\"\nThe other choices don't logically follow from the situation described:\n- Choice A mentions skating towards the camera, which isn't relevant. \n- Choice B mentions a skateboard and mat, which were not part of the original scenario.\n- Choice C mentions falling in snow, but the scenario doesn't indicate they are skating in snowy conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
