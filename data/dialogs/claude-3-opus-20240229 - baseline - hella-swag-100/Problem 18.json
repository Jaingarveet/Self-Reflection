It also doesn't acknowledge the importance of grieving mentioned in the prompt.\nB: This choice logically follows the idea in the prompt of not avoiding the grieving process. It validates that the feelings are difficult but important to experience for healing in the long run. The substep about accepting the uncomfortable feelings of withdrawal builds on this productively.\nC: The first sentence seems to say the opposite of the prompt - that cutting the ex out of your life means holding onto emotions longer. The substeps about deep breathing are okay but a bit disconnected. Overall not the strongest fit.\nD: Giving yourself only one day to care contradicts the prompt's point about not making shortcuts around grieving. The rest is a bit vague and doesn't fit as well tonally.\nConsidering all the choices, B fits best as a logical and tonal continuation of the original text. It validates the difficulty of the emotions while emphasizing their importance in the healing process, building on the key ideas in the prompt.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
