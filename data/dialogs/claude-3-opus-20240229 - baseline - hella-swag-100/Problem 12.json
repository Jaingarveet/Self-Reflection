When playing the drums, it's common for drummers to also play the cymbals, as they are part of a standard drum kit. Cymbals add accent and variety to the drum rhythm.\n3. The other choices don't make as much sense in the context of playing the drums:\n   - Blowing smoke rings is unrelated to drumming.\n   - Simulating knitting and putting down the sticks would interrupt the drumming.\n   - Spinning around and blowing air into the drums or mouth is not a typical drumming technique.\n4. Therefore, the most likely and sensible completion is that the man also plays the cymbals while playing the drum.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
