Choice A mentions the kite landing on a roof and the person looking at the camera, which doesn't fit the context of an indoor auditorium.\n3. Choice B mentions the person walking away with a woman speaking to the crowd, which could be a plausible continuation of the scene.\n4. Choice C describes the person continuing to fly through the air along with a large group of people watching from the sides, which aligns with the initial description of the scene.\n5. Choice D mentions others also flying kites in the room, but the initial description only mentioned one person flying kites.\nConsidering the context and the most logical continuation of the described scene, Choice C seems to be the most appropriate answer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
