This suggests he is spreading mulch to cover an area of the lawn.\n2. Raking dirt over the newly laid mulch would defeat the purpose of mulching, so choice A doesn't make sense.\n3. Using a leaf blower to blow the mulch around could work, but it's not the most effective or common method for spreading mulch evenly. Raking is more typical.\n4. Scooping out a puddle with the rake is unrelated to the task of spreading mulch, so choice D is not a logical next step.\n5. Bringing another wheelbarrow of mulch and continuing to rake it out over the lawn makes the most sense if the man needs to cover a larger area and one wheelbarrow load was not sufficient.\nTherefore, choice C is the most likely completion of the text.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
