[step] Biennials should be planted in the late spring or early summer to avoid early flowering from exposure to cold temperatures. If the plants flower during the first year, it is likely because they were exposed to frost.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] While waiting to plant, store the vegetable seeds in bags in a warm, dry location. In colder climates, you can get a head start by planting the seeds indoors, and then moving them outside when the weather improves.\n  B: Varieties that do not flower then will flower later. [substeps] Before planting your vegetables in april or june, begin checking them every second day to make sure the soil is even.\n  C: During the growing season, using a frost rake every six to seven weeks is ideal. [substeps] Rows should be spaced with patches of grass spaced about two or three feet apart, and that grass should fall between 12-12 inches (30-61 cm) in length.\n  D: [substeps] If your plants are grown in the late spring or summer, wait for a temperature that's between 30 and 35 degrees fahrenheit (4 to 5 degrees celsius) for the ripen phase to improve growth. [title] Select a sunny area near the plant.\n"

It logically follows the initial text about waiting until after the last frost to plant.\nB: The first sentence doesn't make much sense in context. Checking the soil every second day in April or June seems too frequent and specific.\nC: Using a frost rake every 6-7 weeks during the growing season is not relevant advice for biennial vegetables. The spacing instructions also seem more appropriate for a lawn than a vegetable garden.\nD: The temperature range given for the \"ripen phase\" is too cold and would likely damage or kill the plants. Selecting a sunny area is good general advice but doesn't fit well as a new title.\nChoice A provides the most coherent and relevant information to logically complete the text about planting biennial vegetables.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
