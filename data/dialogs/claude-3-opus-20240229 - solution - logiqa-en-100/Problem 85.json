Paper E cannot be used (condition 4).\n2. If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used (condition 1). However, since paper E cannot be used, we can't conclude anything from this condition.\n3. Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J (condition 2). This means that if either G or H is used, J cannot be used.\n4. If paper G is not used, then paper K is not used (condition 3). The contrapositive of this statement is also true: if paper K is used, then paper G must be used.\n5. Now, since either G or H must be used (because E cannot be used), and G and H cannot be used with J, we can conclude that J cannot be used.\n6. Furthermore, if G is used, then K must also be used (contrapositive of condition 3).\n7. Therefore, J cannot be used, but K must be used. This matches choice [REDACTED].\n"
