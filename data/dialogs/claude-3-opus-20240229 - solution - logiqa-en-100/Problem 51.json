F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is assigned to the sales department\n  B: H is assigned to the production department.\n  C: I was assigned to the sales department.\n  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Given that F must be in production (condition 4), and X is in the same department as F, we know that X, F, and W are all in production (condition 3).\n2. This leaves G, H, I, and Y to be distributed among sales and public relations.\n3. H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1), so they will fill 2 of the 3 spots in either sales or public relations.\n4. F and G cannot be in the same department (condition 2), and F is in production, so G must be in either sales or public relations.\n5. If H and Y are in sales, then G and I must be in public relations (as G cannot be with H and Y). But this is impossible as there is only one spot in public relations.\n6. Therefore, H and Y must be in public relations, and G and I must be in sales.\n7. So the statement \"H is assigned to the production department\" cannot be true.\n"
