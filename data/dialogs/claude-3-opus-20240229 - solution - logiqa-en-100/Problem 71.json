        "content": "Thought process:\nThe question asks which statement can explain why 63% favor college students as nannies, but nearly 60% wouldn't hire a college student nanny themselves. This seems contradictory.\nChoice A is about the type of work people would have college nannies do. It doesn't explain the contradiction between favoring them in general but not wanting to hire them.\nChoice B mentions the salary people are willing to pay. A low salary could explain reluctance to hire, but it doesn't explain why they still favor the idea in general. \nChoice C says 69% think nanny work is good for college students, while only 31% think college nannies provide better service. This suggests people like the idea because they think it benefits the students, not because they expect better housekeeping. That explains favoring the concept in general, while still not wanting to hire a student nanny themselves.\nChoice D is about those who don't approve of student nannies at all. It doesn't explain the contradiction among those who do favor the idea.\nTherefore, choice C is the only one that resolves the apparent contradiction in the survey results.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
