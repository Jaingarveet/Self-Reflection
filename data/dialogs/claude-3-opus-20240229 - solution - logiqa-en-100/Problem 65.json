The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict drunk driving investigations and those without.\n2. Experts believe that strict drunk driving investigations can reduce traffic accidents.\n3. There seems to be an inconsistency between the survey results and expert opinion.\n4. Option [REDACTED] states that severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.\n5. This information helps explain the survey results. If strict investigations are only occurring in cities that already have a high incidence of accidents, it could explain why the accident rates are similar to cities without strict investigations.\n6. Option [REDACTED] directly addresses the inconsistency by providing a plausible reason for the survey results, making it the most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency.\n"

The survey found that traffic accident rates are similar between cities with strict drunk driving enforcement and those without. \n2. However, experts believe strict enforcement should reduce accidents. This seems inconsistent.\n3. To resolve this, we need to find the answer choice that best explains why the survey results differ from expert expectations.\n4. Option A suggests that strict enforcement has been focused on cities that already had high accident rates. \n5. If this is true, it could explain the survey results - the similar accident rates between strict and lenient cities may be because the strict enforcement was implemented in response to already high accident rates in those cities. The enforcement may have reduced accidents from an even higher prior level.\n6. The other options don't directly address the apparent inconsistency between the survey and expert opinion. They mention other related factors but don't resolve the core issue.\n7. Therefore, option A, by providing a plausible explanation for the surprising survey results, is most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency with expert expectations.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
