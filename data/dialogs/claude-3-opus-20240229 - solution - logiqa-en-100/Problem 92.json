Professor Zhao said? \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.\" Professor Qian said ? \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.\" Professor Sun said? \"The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.\nQuestion: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is\nChoices:\n  A: Tsinghua University Team\n  B: China University of Science and Technology Team\n  C: Zhejiang University Team\n  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's reconsider the statements of each professor:\n1. Professor Zhao: \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.\"\n   - If true, this eliminates Tsinghua and Zhejiang, leaving China University of Science and Technology and [REDACTED] as possibilities.\n2. Professor Qian: \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.\"\n   - If true, this directly states that China University of Science and Technology is the champion.\n3. Professor Sun: \"The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.\"\n   - If true, this directly states that Tsinghua University is the champion.\nWe know that only one professor is fully correct, one is half correct, and one is fully incorrect.\n- If Professor Zhao is fully correct, then both Professor Qian and Professor Sun must be incorrect, which violates the constraint.\n- If Professor Qian is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct and Professor Sun is fully incorrect. However, this is inconsistent because Professor Zhao's statement eliminates Tsinghua, contradicting Professor Qian.\n- If Professor Sun is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct (correct about Zhejiang not being champion) and Professor Qian is fully incorrect. This is the only scenario that satisfies the constraints.\nTherefore, the champion must be the Tsinghua University team.\n"
