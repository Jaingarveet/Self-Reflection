(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\nQuestion: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?\nChoices:\n  A: Tang Xiaohua\n  B: Peng Youwen\n  C: Qiu Zhijie\n  D: Song Wenkai\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. If He Zhilian is not selected, then Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the selected girls.\n2. If Guo Yanran is selected, then [REDACTED] cannot be selected (condition 1).\n3. So the three selected boys must be chosen from [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Ren Xiangyang, and [REDACTED].\n4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected (condition 2).\n5. [REDACTED] can be selected since [REDACTED] is not selected (condition 3 allows this).\n6. Therefore, one valid selection for the boys is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and Ren Xiangyang.\n7. [REDACTED] cannot be selected in any case if He Zhilian is not selected.\n"

This is clear.\n2. If Guo Yanran is selected, then Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected (condition 1). This eliminates Tang Xiaohua.\n3. So the three selected boys must be chosen from Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai. \n4. Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot both be selected (condition 2). But one of them could still be selected.\n5. Qiu Zhijie can be selected since Tang Xiaohua is not selected (condition 3 allows this).\n6. Therefore, one valid selection for the boys is Qiu Zhijie, Song Wenkai, and Ren Xiangyang. This shows Song Wenkai can be selected.\n7. The only person who cannot be selected in any case if He Zhilian is not selected is Tang Xiaohua, due to condition 1.\nTherefore, the answer is A: Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected if He Zhilian is not selected.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
