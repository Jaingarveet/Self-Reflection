(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients. The male patients are E, F, and J.\n2. J is a child patient, so if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat an adult male patient.\n3. There are only two adult male patients: E and F.\n4. Therefore, Dr. Zhang must treat J (the child male patient) and either E or F (an adult male patient).\n5. There is no other possible assignment for Dr. Zhang given the constraints.\n6. Thus, it must be true that J is treated by Dr. Zhang.\n"
