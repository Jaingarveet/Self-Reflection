(1) There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.(2) F and G are not in charge of the same department.(3) H and I are not in charge of the same department.\nQuestion: If F and M are not in charge of the same department, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and H are in charge of the same department.\n  B: F and I are in charge of the same department.\n  C: I and P are in charge of the same department.\n  D: M and G are in charge of the same department.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- There are 6 assistants (F, G, H, I, M, P) and 3 departments. \n- Each department has 3 assistants in charge.\n- Each assistant is in charge of at least one department.\n- Only one assistant is in charge of all three departments.\n- F and G cannot be in charge of the same department.\n- H and I cannot be in charge of the same department.\n- F and M are not in charge of the same department.\nLet's call the departments X, Y, and Z.\nFrom the 4th condition, we know one assistant must be in charge of all three departments. Let's suppose it's P (we'll see later that it must be).\nNow, F and M are not in charge of the same department. So they must collectively be in charge of all three, otherwise the assistant in charge of the remaining department would have to be in charge of all three, contradicting that only one assistant has this property. \nWithout loss of generality, suppose F is in charge of X and Y, and M is in charge of Z.\nG can't be in charge of X or Y (since F is), so it must be in charge of Z.\nH and I can't be in charge of the same department. The only way to satisfy this is if one of them is in charge of X and the other Y (since F already occupies X and Y, and M and G occupy Z).\nThe only remaining assistant is P, who as we assumed, must be in charge of all three departments. \nTherefore, I and P are both in charge of X and Y, so the correct answer is [REDACTED].\n"

Without loss of generality, let's suppose F is in charge of departments X and Y, and M is in charge of department Z.\n3.

The only way to satisfy this is if one of them is in charge of X and the other is in charge of Y (since F already occupies X and Y, and M and G occupy Z).\n5. The only remaining assistant is P, who as we assumed earlier, must be in charge of all three departments to satisfy the condition that one assistant is in charge of all three.\n6.
