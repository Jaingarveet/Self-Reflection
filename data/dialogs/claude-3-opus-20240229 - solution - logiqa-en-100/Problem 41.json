If Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, it will go bankrupt. - This must be true. If Green Island can achieve a 10% increase, it can also achieve a 20% increase. Therefore, if it cannot achieve a 20% increase, it cannot achieve a 10% increase either, leading to bankruptcy.\n[REDACTED]. If Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt. - While this is likely true, it is not a necessary conclusion based on the given information.\n[REDACTED]. [REDACTED] - The statement does not provide information about what happens if the market does not change.\n[REDACTED]. Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve a 20% increase. - This contradicts the given information, which states that a 10% increase implies a 20% increase is possible.\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The key information given is:\n   - Green Island must increase productivity by 10% in the next two years to avoid bankruptcy.\n   - If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can actually achieve a 20% increase.\n2. Now let's analyze each answer choice:\n   A. If Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, it will go bankrupt. \n      - This must be true. If Green Island can achieve a 10% increase, it can also achieve a 20% increase. \n      - Therefore, if it cannot achieve a 20% increase, it cannot achieve a 10% increase either, which would lead to bankruptcy.\n   B. If Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.\n      - While this is likely true, it is not a necessary conclusion based solely on the given information. The passage doesn't state what happens if productivity increases by 20%.\n   C. If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.\n      - The statement does not provide any information about what happens if the market does not change. We cannot draw this conclusion.\n   D. Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve a 20% increase. \n      - This directly contradicts the given information, which states that if a 10% increase is possible, then a 20% increase is also possible.\n3. Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
