At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nXiao Chen argues that since the flickering of Comet 1996D3 far from the sun has not been observed before, it must be an unusual occurrence. \nXiao Wang counters by saying that people don't normally observe distant comets, and this flickering was only discovered through continuous, careful tracking. \nXiao Wang is pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument jumps to a conclusion and lacks persuasion. Just because something hasn't been observed before doesn't mean it's necessarily unusual - it could simply be due to lack of sufficient observation in the past.\nTherefore, Xiao Wang's refutation focuses on exposing the weakness and lack of persuasion in Xiao Chen's line of reasoning, not on providing an alternative explanation.\n"

        "content": "You're right, upon further reflection I see that Xiao Wang is directly challenging the persuasiveness of Xiao Chen's argument, rather than offering an alternative explanation.\nXiao Chen argues that since the comet's flickering hasn't been observed before, it must be unusual. But Xiao Wang points out the flaw in this reasoning - just because something hasn't been seen before doesn't necessarily mean it's unusual. It could simply be that no one was looking carefully enough in the past. \nXiao Wang exposes how Xiao Chen's argument jumps to a conclusion without sufficient evidence. He's not agreeing with the conclusion and providing another explanation for it. Rather, he's disagreeing with the conclusion by showing how the argument used to reach it is unpersuasive and lacks justification.\nSo in summary, Xiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen by pointing out that his argument is clearly lacking in persuasion, as the conclusion doesn't follow from the premise.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
