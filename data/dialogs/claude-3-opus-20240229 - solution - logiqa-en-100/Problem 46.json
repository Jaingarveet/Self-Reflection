F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following pairs of employees is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department?\nChoices:\n  A: G and I\n  B: G and X\n  C: G and Y\n  D: H and W\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. From condition (4), F must be in production.\n2. From condition (2), since F is in production, G cannot be in production. So G must be in either sales or public relations.\n3. From condition (1), H and Y must be in the same department.\n4. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. \n   - This means that if X is in sales, H and Y cannot be in production (because W would be the 3rd person in production, leaving no room for H and Y).\n   - It also means that if X is in sales, H and Y must be in public relations (because they can't be in production or sales).\n5. So if X is in sales:\n   - W must be in production\n   - H and Y must be in public relations\n   - F is in production\n   - This leaves only I and G for the remaining 2 sales spots and 1 production spot.\n6. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together. If X is in sales, G must be in the remaining production spot.\n7. Looking at the other choices:\n   - [REDACTED] could be in sales together (if X is not in sales)\n   - [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together (because H and Y must be together, and if they're in sales, G must be in PR)\n   - [REDACTED] could be in sales together (if X is not in sales)\nTherefore, the pair that cannot be in sales together is [REDACTED].\n"

Therefore, if X is in sales, G and X cannot be in sales together. G would have to take the last production spot.\n6.
