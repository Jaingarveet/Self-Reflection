Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?\nChoices:\n  A: The cost and selling price of \"Inferno\" are lower than that of \"Harbour\".\n  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.\n  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.\n  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to \"Inferno\" magazine.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe passage argues that some advertisers consider ethical responsibilities in addition to economic benefits, as evidenced by their refusal to renew contracts with \"Inferno\" magazine after it changed its content to include violence and pornography.\nTo strengthen this argument, we should look for additional evidence that supports the claim about advertisers' motivations.\n[REDACTED]: The cost and pricing of \"Inferno\" do not directly relate to advertisers' ethical considerations. (Irrelevant)\n[REDACTED]: Advertisers maintaining benefits after switching publications suggests they didn't suffer economically, but it doesn't necessarily prove they were motivated by ethics. (Weak support)\n[REDACTED]: Reader preferences don't directly address advertisers' motivations. (Irrelevant)\n[REDACTED]: If some advertisers are switching to \"Inferno\" despite the content change, it suggests that not all advertisers are prioritizing ethical concerns over reaching the new target audience. This weakens the claim that advertisers are motivated by ethical responsibilities, thereby strengthening the argument by contrast. (Strongest support)\nTherefore, option [REDACTED] most strengthens the argument.\n"
