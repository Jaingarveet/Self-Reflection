        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?\nChoices:\n  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.\n  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.\n  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.\n  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's re-evaluate each choice to determine if it allows the given opinion to be questioned:\n[REDACTED]: The fact that grass in Xilin Gol grassland has significantly decreased in height over time supports the idea that grassland degradation has occurred, which is consistent with the opinion. This choice does not question the opinion.\n[REDACTED]: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia and the thriving grasslands in Mongolia suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible for the degradation. This choice questions the opinion.\n[REDACTED]: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.\n[REDACTED]: This choice directly states that human factors are the main causes of increased dust storms, questioning the opinion that they are inevitable natural disasters caused by climate drought.\nTherefore, choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] allow the given opinion to be questioned, while choice [REDACTED] supports the opinion.\n"
