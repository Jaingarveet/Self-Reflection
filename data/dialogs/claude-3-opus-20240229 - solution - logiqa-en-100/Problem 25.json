[REDACTED] is a doctor but not tall, so he can't meet all the requirements.\n7. [REDACTED] is a doctor and must be tall (because there are 3 tall men, and [REDACTED] is tall, and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall).\n8.

Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.\nNow, let's deduce:\n- Since Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, and Li Qiang is the same height as Liu Dawei, it means Liu Dawei must be tall (one of the 3 tall men).\n- Wang Wei is a doctor but not tall. So he doesn't meet all the requirements.\n- Wu Gang is a doctor and must be tall (because there are 3 tall men total, Liu Dawei is tall, and Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall). \n- Since there is only one handsome man among the four, and Wu Gang is the only one who is known for certain to be both tall and a doctor, he must be the handsome one to meet all the criteria.\nTherefore, Wu Gang meets all the requirements that Li Na is looking for.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
