G is the northernmost island.\n[REDACTED]. F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H. So the arrangement of F and H is fixed as: F - H\n[REDACTED]. I and E are adjacent, but their relative positions can vary. There are two possible arrangements: I - E and E - I\n[REDACTED]. The I-E or E-I pair can be placed either north or south of the F-H pair.\n[REDACTED]. Considering all the possibilities, we have the following [REDACTED] arrangements:\n   - G - I - E - F - H\n   - G - E - I - F - H\n   - G - F - H - I - E\n   - G - F - H - E - I\n6.
