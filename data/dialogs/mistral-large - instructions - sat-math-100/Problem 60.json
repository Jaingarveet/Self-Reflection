        "content": "Thought:\nLet x be the number of students in the class.\nAccording to the problem, Mr. Kohl has n milliliters of solution. When he gives each student 3 milliliters, he has 5 milliliters left over. So, we can write the equation:\nn = 3x + 5\nIn order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. So, we can write another equation:\nn + 21 = 4x\nNow, we can solve this system of equations.\nSubtract the first equation from the second equation:\n(n + 21) - (3x + 5) = 4x - 3x\nn + 21 - 3x - 5 = x\nn - 3x + 16 = x\nSubstitute the first equation into this equation:\n3x + 5 - 3x + 16 = x\n21 = x\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I made a mistake in setting up the equations. I incorrectly subtracted the first equation from the second equation, which led to an incorrect result. After reflecting on the problem, I realized my mistake and corrected it. Now, I have the correct answer, which is choice B: 21."
