Identify the specific characteristics of each type of ovarian tumor.\n2. Consider how these characteristics affect the likelihood of torsion during pregnancy.\n3. Evaluate the risk factors associated with each type of ovarian tumor during pregnancy.\n4. Choose the answer that best fits the criteria for the most likely type of ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the specific features of each type of ovarian tumor.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the specific features of each type of medical condition when answering questions.\n - Never make assumptions about the likelihood of a medical condition based on general knowledge.\n - Always evaluate the risk factors associated with each type of medical condition.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the specific features of each type of medical condition.\n - Remember that the most common type of medical condition is not necessarily the most likely to cause a specific complication.\n"
