Identify the disorder in question.\n2. Identify the gene involved in the disorder.\n3. Identify the mode of inheritance of the disorder.\n4. Identify the characteristics of the disorder.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the mode of inheritance and characteristics of the disorder.\n6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the mode of inheritance is a critical aspect of genetic disorders.\n - Be aware of the differences between autosomal and X-linked inheritance patterns.\n - Be aware of the differences between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns.\n - Be aware of the differences between different types of genetic disorders.\n"
