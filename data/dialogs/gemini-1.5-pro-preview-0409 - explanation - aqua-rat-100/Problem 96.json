At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 months\n  B: 4 months\n  C: 23 months\n  D: 24 months\n  E: 84 months\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy approach was partially correct in recognizing the proportion of C's profit and relating it to the time of investment.

We need to find how many months after B joined.\nSo, the answer is 5/9 - 2 = -13/9 months. \nSince the answer choices do not have a negative option, there might be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices. \nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\") \n"
