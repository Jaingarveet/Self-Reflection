I assumed that if Green Island can increase productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt, which is not necessarily true based on the information given.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logical implication error\n- Conditional reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe statement says that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can also achieve a 20% increase. It also says that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% to avoid bankruptcy. Therefore, if Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, which is a higher threshold than the necessary 10%, it will certainly not meet the minimum requirement of 10% and will go bankrupt. So, the correct answer is A.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the logical implications of the statements.\n2. Identify the necessary conditions for Green Island to avoid bankruptcy.\n3. Understand the relationship between a 10% increase and a 20% increase in productivity.\n4. Determine the implications if Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase in productivity.\n5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the given statements.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the logical implications of the statements.\n- Understand the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.\n- Be careful with conditional reasoning and understand the implications of not meeting a condition.\n- Always double-check your reasoning before choosing an answer.\n"
