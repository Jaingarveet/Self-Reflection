At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views. I thought Xiao Wang was providing an alternative explanation, but in reality, he was pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument lacked persuasiveness because it was based on the assumption that people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Argument analysis\n- Refutation method\nSolution:\nXiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen's views by pointing out that the observation of the comet's flicker was not unusual but was the result of continuous and careful tracking observation. This suggests that the flicker might have been observed before if such careful observation had been done. However, this doesn't provide an alternative explanation, but rather points out that Xiao Chen's argument is lacking in persuasion because it's based on an assumption. Therefore, the correct answer is B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the views of each person.\n2. Identify the method used by one person to refute the other's views.\n3. Determine whether the refutation is based on pointing out ambiguity, lack of persuasion, contradiction, disagreement with conclusion, or agreement with conclusion but with a different explanation.\n4. Choose the answer that best describes the refutation method.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the context.\n- Pay attention to the method used to refute an argument, not just the content of the argument.\n- Understand the difference between providing an alternative explanation and pointing out a lack of persuasion.\n- Practice more questions on argument analysis to improve your understanding of different refutation methods.\n"
