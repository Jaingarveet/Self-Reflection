I also did not fully understand the concept of \"doubtful\" in this context.\nTo improve my answer, I will:\n* Carefully read the context and the specific question being asked.\n* Consider all of the answer choices and eliminate those that are clearly not the most doubtful.\n* Use my knowledge of logic and reasoning to identify the answer choice that is most likely to be false or misleading.\n* Explain my reasoning clearly and concisely.\nAnswer:\nThe most doubtful assertion is **C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.**\nThis assertion is doubtful because it is based on the assumption that land development costs are the only factor that affects house prices. However, there are many other factors that can affect house prices, such as supply and demand, interest rates, and government policies. Therefore, it is not certain that house prices will definitely increase as land development costs increase.\nThe other answer choices are not as doubtful as C. For example, A and B provide specific evidence that land prices have risen in Shanghai and Beijing, which supports the assertion that rising land prices are a factor in soaring housing prices. D provides an explanation for why housing prices might be rising, but it does not make a definitive claim that land development costs are the only factor.\nTherefore, the answer is **C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.**"
