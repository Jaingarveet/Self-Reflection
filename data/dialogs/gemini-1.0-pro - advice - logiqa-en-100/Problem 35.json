I focused on statement (3) and concluded that Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, without considering the other statements and their implications.\n## Improved approach:\n1. **Analyze each statement individually:**\n    - (1) Li was hired by Tianshu.\n    - (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.\n    - (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.\n    - (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\n2. **Consider all possible combinations of employer assignments:**\n    - Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, Liu\n    - Tianshu, Tianji, Tianxuan\n3. **Eliminate options that contradict the statements:**\n    - Option A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit. This contradicts statement (2) if Li is hired by Tianshu.\n    - Option B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji. This contradicts statement (4) if Zhang is hired by Tianxuan.\n    - Option C: Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan. This contradicts statement (4) if Zhang is hired by Tianxuan.\n4. **The remaining option is the only one that satisfies all statements:**\n    - Option D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan. This satisfies all statements, including statement (4) if Zhang is hired by Tianxuan.\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, the only option that may be correct is D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\n## Action:\nAnswer(\"D\")"
