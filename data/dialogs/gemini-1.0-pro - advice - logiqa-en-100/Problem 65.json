I also did not consider the possibility that there might be other factors besides drunk driving that contribute to traffic accidents.\nIn order to eliminate the inconsistency between the survey results and the expert opinions, we need to consider the following:\n* The survey results might be flawed. It is possible that the survey did not accurately measure the incidence of traffic accidents in the cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated.\n* There might be other factors besides drunk driving that contribute to traffic accidents. For example, the cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated might also have other traffic safety measures in place, such as stricter speed limits or more police enforcement.\n* The expert opinions might be biased. It is possible that the experts are biased in favor of strict investigation of drunk driving.\nThe option that provides the most logical and consistent explanation is B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving. This option acknowledges the possibility that the survey results might be flawed and that there might be other factors besides drunk driving that contribute to traffic accidents. It also acknowledges the possibility that the expert opinions might be biased.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
