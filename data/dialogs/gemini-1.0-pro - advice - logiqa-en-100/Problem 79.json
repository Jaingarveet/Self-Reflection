I focused too much on the conclusion of the argument (that there must be an outside world) and not enough on the premises that support it.\nI have learned that it is important to pay close attention to the details of the argument and to consider how each answer choice interacts with those details. I have also learned that it is important to be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.\nI will use this knowledge to answer the question correctly this time.\nThought:\nThe argument claims that the existence of visual experience is evidence for the existence of an outside world. Option A challenges this claim by pointing out that using sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind. This is a valid point, as it shows that the argument is circular. Option B asks how we can prove that others have similar visual experience to us. This is a valid question, as it shows that the argument relies on an unproven assumption. Option C claims that mirages are real, which contradicts the argument's claim that visual experience is reliable evidence for the existence of an outside world. Option D asks why natural science is so successful if there is no external world. This is a valid question, as it shows that the argument's conclusion is inconsistent with our experience of the world.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
