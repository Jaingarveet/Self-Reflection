I assumed that it meant \"hostage\" because it appeared in the phrase \"kidnapping student (host) hostage\". However, it is also possible that \"Doximayo\" means \"student\".\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will be more careful to consider all possible interpretations of words and phrases.
