This assumption is crucial because it allows the argument to conclude that stealing is good for someone who lives one day. However, this assumption is unrealistic and unprovable. \n## Choosing the correct answer:\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \nThis answer directly addresses the unstated assumption upon which the argument relies. \n"
