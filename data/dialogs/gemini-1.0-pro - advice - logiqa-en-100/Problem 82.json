This was because I focused too narrowly on the fact that the house is a small property house and did not consider the possibility that it may have been tacitly approved by the relevant departments.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will pay more attention to all of the premises in the argument and consider all of the possible ways in which they could be weakened or strengthened.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")**"
