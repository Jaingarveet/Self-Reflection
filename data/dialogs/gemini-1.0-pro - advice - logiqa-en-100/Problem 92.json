I should have paid more attention to the fact that only one of the professors made two correct judgments.\nHere's my analysis:\n* Professor Zhao said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team. This statement is true because the champion is either the China University of Science and Technology team or the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.\n* Professor Qian said that the champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China. This statement is also true because the champion is either the China University of Science and Technology team or the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team.\n* Professor Sun said that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team. This statement is false because the champion cannot be both the China University of Science and Technology team and the Tsinghua University team.\nTherefore, we know that Professor Sun made one correct judgment (that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team) and one incorrect judgment (that the champion is the Tsinghua University team). This means that the champion must be the **Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics team**.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
