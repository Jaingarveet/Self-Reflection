However, I realized that erosion is the process of wearing away or removal of soil or rock particles from a given surface or location. It doesn't directly construct new land.\n\nThe correct answer is C, deposition. Deposition is the process of sediment, rock, or other material settling out of a fluid, such as air or water, and accumulating in a new location. This accumulation can eventually form new land, such as deltas, beaches, or even entire islands.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
