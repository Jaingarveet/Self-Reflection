I will use the substitution method to solve the system of equations.\n3. Solving for x in the second equation gives $x=2y+19$. Substituting this expression for x in the first equation gives $3(2y+19)+4y=-23$, which simplifies to $10y=-80$. Solving for y gives $y=-8$. Substituting this value for y in the second equation gives $x=2(-8)+19=-5$.\n4. Double-checking the calculations, $3(-5)+4(-8)=-15-32=-47$ and $2(-8)-(-5)=-16+5=-11$, which matches the original system of equations.\n5. The solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=(-5,-8)$, which matches answer choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
