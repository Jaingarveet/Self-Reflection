The slope of the line passing through the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ is $\\frac{32-k}{k-2}$. \nUsing the fact that the line passes through the origin, we have $\\frac{32-k}{k-2}=\\frac{32}{k}$.\n2. Substituting $x=2$ and $y=k$ in the equation of the line, we get $\\frac{y-k}{x-2}=\\frac{32-k}{k-2}$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $y=\\frac{34k-64}{k-2}$.\nSubstituting $x=k$ and $y=32$ in the equation of the line, we get $\\frac{32-k}{k-2}=\\frac{32}{k}$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $k^2-64=0$, which gives $k=\\pm8$.\n5. Checking each answer choice, we find that $k=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }8}$ is a possible value of $k$.\nSelf-reflection:\nI made a mistake in my previous attempt to solve this problem by not checking the answer choice $k=8$. I also did not check if the equation of the line passes through both given points for each answer choice. In this attempt, I followed the correct steps and found that $k=8$ is a possible value of $k$."
