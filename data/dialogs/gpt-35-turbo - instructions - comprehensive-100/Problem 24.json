Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since only two reports can be given each day. Thus, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are:\n- Monday: [REDACTED]\n- Tuesday: George and [REDACTED]\n- Wednesday: Nina and [REDACTED]\nThe only answer choice that matches this result is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
