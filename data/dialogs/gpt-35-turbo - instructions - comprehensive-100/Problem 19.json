Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the conclusion that is not true.\n3. Identify the statement that can logically explain why the conclusion is not true.\n4. Consider each option and evaluate whether it provides a logical explanation for the conclusion.\n5. Choose the option that provides the best logical explanation for the conclusion.\n"
