At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

We also know that H cannot be on the top shelf since it must be placed with I on the middle shelf. Therefore, H must be on the bottom shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf, and F is not on the top shelf, then F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, if F and M are on the middle shelf, then K would have to be on the top shelf, which is not possible since K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and L is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the top or middle shelf. However, if O is on the middle shelf, then K would have to be on the top shelf, which is not possible. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf. This means that K must be on the middle shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf. The only book left to place on the middle shelf is G, so the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, K.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
