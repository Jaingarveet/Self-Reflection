Let's assume that they meet after t hours.\n5. The distance traveled by the first car is 12t, and the distance traveled by the second car is 13t.\n6. The sum of the distances traveled by both cars is equal to the total distance between them, which is 50 miles.\n7. Therefore, the equation is 12t + 13t = 50.\n8. Solving for t, we get t = 2.\n9. Double-checking, 12(2) + 13(2) = 24 + 26 = 50.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
