However, they can be irritating to the skin and are not recommended for patients with sensitive skin. \nEstrogen is not a treatment option for acne, as it can actually worsen acne in some cases. \nBased on this information, the best treatment option for the patient's comedonal acne would be benzoyl peroxide. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
