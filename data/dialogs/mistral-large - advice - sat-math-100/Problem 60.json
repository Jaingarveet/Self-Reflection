        "content": "Thought:\nLet's denote the number of students in the class as x.\nAccording to the problem, Mr. Kohl has n milliliters of solution.\nWhen he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. So, we can write the equation:\nn = 3x + 5\nWhen he gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional 21 milliliters. So, we can write the equation:\nn + 21 = 4x\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\nFrom the first equation, we can express n as:\nn = 3x + 5\nNow, substitute this expression for n in the second equation:\n3x + 5 + 21 = 4x\nSimplify the equation:\n26 = x\nSo, there are 26 students in the class.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I made a mistake in simplifying the equation. I incorrectly wrote 21 = x instead of 26 = x. This time, I made sure to simplify the equation correctly and double-checked my calculations. I also followed the advice to decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and think through each step carefully."
