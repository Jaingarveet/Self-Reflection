(1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?\nChoices:\n  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X\n  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y\n  C: Public Relations Department?

In fact, condition (3) states that if X is in Sales, then W must be in Production, but it does not restrict their placement if X is NOT in Sales. This means that both W and X could be in the Production department, fulfilling condition (3) by not placing X in Sales.\n\nThought: \nBreaking down the conditions:\n(1) H and Y must be in the same department.\n(2) F and G cannot be in the same department.\n(3) If X is in Sales, then W must be in Production.\n(4) F must be in the Production department.\n\nFrom condition (4), we know that F will be in the Production department. Condition (2) then places G in the Sales department to ensure they are not in the same department. Condition (3) tells us that if X is in Sales, W must be in Production. However, if X is NOT in Sales, there is no restriction on W's placement, and they could be in either Production or Public Relations. Condition (1) requires that H and Y be in the same department, and they can fill the remaining spots in either Production or Sales to satisfy the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nPublic Relations: W\nProduction: F, H, Y\nSales: G, I, X\n\nThis satisfies all the given conditions.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
