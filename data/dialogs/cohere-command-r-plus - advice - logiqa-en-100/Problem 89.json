(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n- Carefully consider all given conditions and their implications. \n- Systematically analyze the characteristics and relationships between the patients and doctors. \n- Avoid making assumptions that go beyond what is given or implied by the conditions. \n- Look for necessary connections between the conditions and the choices to determine which must be true.\n"

Condition (3) then implies that if Dr. Zhang treats a male child, he must also treat a male adult. J is a male child, so if Dr. Zhang treats J, he fulfills both (1) and (3). This connection between conditions (1) and (3) is unique to Dr. Zhang and patient J, hence the correct answer is C."
