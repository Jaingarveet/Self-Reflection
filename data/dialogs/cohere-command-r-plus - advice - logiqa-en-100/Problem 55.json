(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in front Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: Which of the following lists are acceptable arrangements for the second team's performance?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? H Middle? P After? K\n  B: Before? H Middle? L After? N\n  C: Before? G In? Q After? P\n  D: Before? G In? Q After?

This means that if N is in the second team, neither P nor K can be in that team.\n\nThought: \nGiven the conditions:\n1. G or H can be in the front position.\n2. K must be in the middle position.\n3. L must be on Team 1.\n4. N, P, and K cannot be on the same team.\n5. P and Q cannot be on the same team.\n6. If H is on Team 2, Q must be in the middle position on Team 1.\n\nFor the second team:\n- Condition (4) states that N, P, and K cannot be on the same team, so if N is in the second team, neither P nor K can be on that team.\n- Condition (5) states that P and Q also cannot be on the same team.\n\nTherefore, the acceptable arrangements for the second team are those that do not include N, P, or K together, and also keep P and Q separate:\n- Option A: Before? H Middle? P After? K - This violates condition (4) as P and K are on the same team.\n- Option B: Before? H Middle? L After? N - This is acceptable as it does not include P or K with N, and P and Q are also separate.\n- Option C: Before? G In? Q After? P - This violates condition (5) as P and Q are on the same team.\n- Option D: Before? G In? Q After? N - This is acceptable as it does not include P or K with N, and P and Q are also separate.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B and D.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B, D\")"
