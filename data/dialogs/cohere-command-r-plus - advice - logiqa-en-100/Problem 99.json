Gene screening, as described, aims to avoid reproductive defects and has a more targeted scope, while \"customized babies\" suggest a broader and more uncontrolled application of genetic modification, akin to cloning. This misinterpretation led to an incorrect answer.\n\nThought: \nThe correct answer effectively refutes the notion of \"customized babies\" by distinguishing it from gene screening. It clarifies that gene screening has a specific and limited purpose, while \"customizing babies\" ventures into the realm of cloning and raises significant ethical concerns.\n\nChoice A and B discuss the potential pitfalls of technology but do not directly address the misconception. Choice D mentions the ethical concerns and the lack of global attempts, but it does not provide a clear distinction between gene screening and \"customization.\"\n\nChoice C makes this distinction explicitly, refuting the idea that the two concepts are interchangeable. It highlights that gene screening has a focused application, while \"customized babies\" invoke a separate and more complex set of considerations.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
