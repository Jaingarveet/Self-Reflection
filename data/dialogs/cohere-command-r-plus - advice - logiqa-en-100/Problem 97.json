The correct answer instead highlights a key assumption about user base stability, undermining the interpretation of post increases as indicative of social atmosphere changes.\n\nThought: \nThe argument assumes that the user base of the forum has remained relatively stable over the years, and thus the increase in certain types of posts directly reflects a change in social atmosphere. \nChoice B weakens this assumption by suggesting that the increase in relevant posts could be primarily due to an expanded user base, rather than a change in social attitudes or conditions. This alternative explanation undermines the argument's conclusion that society is deteriorating.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
