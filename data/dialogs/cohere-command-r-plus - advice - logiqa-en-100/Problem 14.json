Administration is above Planning but below HR.\n\nIf HR is not directly above Administration, it could be:\n1. HR is 2 floors above Administration (with an unknown department in between).\n2. HR is somewhere below Administration.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- Option A: This option is about the relative positions of Sales and R&D, which are not constrained by the given conditions, so it is possible.\n- Option B: If Administration is above Planning, and Sales is above Administration, then Sales must be 2 floors above Planning. But, we know that Finance is directly above Planning, so this option violates the condition that Sales and HR are not adjacent.\n- Option C: If Planning is somewhere in the middle, with Finance above it and Administration below it, then Sales cannot be next to Planning as that would make Sales and Finance adjacent, which is not possible.\n- Option D: This option places Sales on the second floor, which means Planning, Finance, and Administration must occupy the third, fourth, and fifth floors in some order. However, this would mean that HR is on the sixth floor, making HR and Administration adjacent, which contradicts the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, only Option A satisfies all the constraints and is a possible correct answer.\n\nAnswer: A"
