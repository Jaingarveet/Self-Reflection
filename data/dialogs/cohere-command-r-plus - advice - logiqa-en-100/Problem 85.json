Statement (4) rules out paper E, and statement (3) indicates that if paper G is not needed, then paper K is also not needed. This directly contradicts statement (1), which states that if paper E is used, paper K must be used. Therefore, statement (1) cannot be true, and my previous answer of \"C\" was incorrect.\n\nNow, considering statement (2), either paper G or paper H can be used, but not both, as they cannot be used with paper J. Statement (3) still holds, and paper K cannot be used without paper G. With these considerations, the correct answer should be \"D: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.\"\n\nThought: Statements (1) and (4) contradict each other, so we can ignore statement (1). Statement (2) tells us that paper G or paper H can be used, but not together, and not with paper J. Statement (3) tells us that if paper G is not used, then paper K is also not used. Therefore, if paper J is used, then neither G nor K can be used. This means that both G and J articles are indeed unnecessary, making choice \"D\" the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
