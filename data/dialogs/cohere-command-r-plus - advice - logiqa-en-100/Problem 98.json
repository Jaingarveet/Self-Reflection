It acknowledges that while some rules align with our moral conscience, others may contradict it, and we can evaluate the validity of these rules independently of their legal status.\n\nChoice C directly supports this argument by asserting that behind any judgment of right and wrong, there are underlying rules or standards that people use as a basis for their judgment. This reinforces the argument's acknowledgment that right and wrong are often tied to prescribed rules, even if those rules can be scrutinized and found wanting at times.\n\nWhile choice A questions how we can judge right and wrong without following pre-existing regulations, it does not directly support the argument's acknowledgment of the complex interplay between rules and moral judgments. Choices B and D introduce external factors (\"heaven\" and \"universal moral conscience,\" respectively) that are not directly relevant to the argument's focus on the relationship between rules and moral judgments.\n\nTherefore, choice C is the correct answer as it reinforces the argument's acknowledgment of the connection between prescribed rules and judgments of right and wrong.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
