I focused too narrowly on the first part of the argument, which mentioned sensory evidence, and chose an answer related to that. However, the argument also includes the mention of 'others' having similar experiences and the success of natural science, which are crucial to the broader context. The correct answer should consider the argument's entirety and identify a choice that doesn't cast doubt on the conclusion.\n\nThought: \nThe argument concludes that there must be an outside world based on visual experiences, shared experiences of others, and the success of natural science.\nChoice A questions the validity of using sensory evidence by claiming it presupposes the existence of the external world, which is a doubt against the argument.\nChoice B questions how it can be proven that others have similar visual experiences, directly challenging the argument's claim.\nChoice C asserts that mirages are real and not illusions, which doesn't address the argument's main point and fails to acknowledge the argument's conclusion.\nChoice D raises a valid point about the success of natural science, which supports the argument's conclusion. It doesn't constitute doubt or rebuttal as it doesn't challenge the argument's core claims.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
