A small problem multiplied by 1.3 billion becomes a significant challenge, while a large total divided by the same number becomes a modest amount. This mathematical illustration conveys how population scale transforms situations.\n\nChoice B captures the essence of his statement by acknowledging that China's large population complicates its situation, warranting a cautious approach from politicians. It reflects the idea that a small issue can become daunting when multiplied by 1.3 billion, aligning with the provided context.\n\nWhile the other choices touch on related themes, they deviate from the specific point made by Premier Wen Jiabao.\n\nChoice A suggests that supporting 1.3 billion people in living a good life is challenging, but it introduces an idea about threatening others that is not present in the original statement.\n\nChoice C mentions China's large population and arduous development tasks but then shifts to a statement about not threatening other countries, which is not the main point of the provided context.\n\nChoice D employs a proverb, \"Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high,\" suggesting that collective effort leads to significant results. However, this proverb doesn't capture the specific point about the impact of China's population scale on issues.\n\nTherefore, Choice B is the closest to Premier Wen Jiabao's statement, conveying the mathematical and political implications of China's vast population.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
