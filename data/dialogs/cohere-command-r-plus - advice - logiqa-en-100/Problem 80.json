HR - 1st floor, Sales - 6th floor \n2. HR - 1st floor, Sales - 5th floor \n3. HR - 2nd floor, Sales - 6th floor \n4. HR - 6th floor, Sales - 1st floor \n\nWe also know that the finance department is on the floor right above or below the planning department. This gives us two configurations for these two departments: \n1. Finance - 1st and 2nd floors, Planning - 2nd and 3rd floors \n2. Finance - 5th and 6th floors, Planning - 4th and 5th floors \n\nNow, we can combine these arrangements while also considering the relative positions of the administration department to the planning and human resources departments. \n\nCase 1: HR - 1st floor, Sales - 6th floor \nIn this case, the administration department must be either between planning and HR or below planning. \n\nSubcase 1.1: Finance - 1st and 2nd floors, Planning - 2nd and 3rd floors, Administration - 4th floor, HR - 1st floor, Sales - 6th floor, R&D - 5th floor \n\nSubcase 1.2: Finance - 2nd and 3rd floors, Planning - 3rd and 4th floors, Administration - 5th floor, HR - 1st floor, Sales - 6th floor, R&D - 6th floor \n\nCase 2: HR - 1st floor, Sales - 5th floor \nSimilar to the previous case, the administration department can be between planning and HR or below planning. \n\nSubcase 2.1: Finance - 1st and 2nd floors, Planning - 2nd and 3rd floors, Administration - 4th floor, HR - 1st floor, Sales - 5th floor, R&D - 6th floor \n\nSubcase 2.2: Finance - 2nd and 3rd floors, Planning - 3rd and 4th floors, Administration - 5th floor, HR - 1st floor, Sales - 5th floor, R&D - 6th floor \n\nCase 3: HR - 2nd floor, Sales - 6th floor \nHere, the administration department must be either between HR and finance or between planning and finance. \n\nSubcase 3.1: Planning - 1st and 2nd floors, Finance - 2nd and 3rd floors, Administration - 3rd floor, HR - 2nd floor, Sales - 6th floor, R&D - 4th floor \n\nSubcase 3.2: Planning - 1st and 2nd floors, Finance - 3rd and 4th floors, Administration - 4th floor, HR - 2nd floor, Sales - 6th floor, R&D - 5th floor \n\nCase 4: HR - 6th floor, Sales - 1st floor \nIn this scenario, the administration department is either between finance and HR or between finance and planning. \n\nSubcase 4.1: Finance - 4th and 5th floors, Planning - 3rd and 4th floors, Administration - 6th floor, HR - 6th floor, Sales - 1st floor, R&D - 2nd floor \n\nSubcase 4.2: Finance - 5th and 6th floors, Planning - 4th and 5th floors, Administration - 1st floor, HR - 6th floor, Sales - 1st floor, R&D - 2nd floor \n\nAfter analyzing all these possibilities, it's clear that only choice B satisfies all the conditions. \n\nChoice A is incorrect because it places the sales department right next to the human resources department, which contradicts the given information. \nChoice C is wrong because it places the finance department adjacent to the sales department, which is not possible given the configuration of the other departments. \nChoice D is incorrect because it places the planning department adjacent to the sales department, which again contradicts the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice B.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
