To doubt this assertion, we should look for alternative factors that could influence housing prices.\n\nChoice A provides data showing a significant increase in Shanghai's housing prices, with a smaller rise in land prices. While the land price increase is modest compared to housing prices, it doesn't cast doubt on the argument's claim that land prices influence housing costs.\n\nChoice B presents data from Beijing, showing a similar relationship as Shanghai, with residential prices increasing alongside land prices. This evidence supports the argument rather than doubts it.\n\nChoice C offers the opinion of a real estate chairman who directly supports the assertion, linking rising land development costs to higher housing prices. This statement clearly agrees with the argument and does not cast doubt on it.\n\nChoice D provides an alternative explanation from the chairman of Yongtai Development Company, attributing soaring housing prices to a supply and demand imbalance. This statement suggests that factors other than land prices, specifically market demand and supply dynamics, could be primarily responsible for the increase in housing costs. This alternative explanation raises doubt about the argument's claim that rising land prices are the chief culprit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nReflection on previous incorrect answer: I focused too narrowly on the magnitude of the land price increase in Choice D and failed to recognize that the comparison was intended to highlight the impact of supply and demand. I misinterpreted the relationship and didn't consider the alternative factors suggested. For questions like these, it's crucial to consider the precise relationships and alternative influences presented.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
