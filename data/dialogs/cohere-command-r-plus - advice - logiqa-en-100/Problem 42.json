This information weakens the argument's conclusion because it suggests that the cave may have been inaccessible for a significant period, including the Neolithic Age. Therefore, the presence of artifacts does not necessarily indicate habitation during that specific period.\n\nReflection: I previously selected Choice C as it mentioned the prehistoric nature of the site, but this does not directly refute the argument's conclusion about habitation. Choice D is the correct answer as it introduces a timeline discrepancy that casts doubt on the argument's interpretation of the evidence.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
