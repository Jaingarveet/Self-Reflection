[step] One of the most critical aspects to being indie is not adopting other people's views without evaluating the situation yourself. Going with the crowd is never something that an indie person would do, so make sure that you are making independent decisions when it comes to music, clothing, and your opinions.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Understand how people may affect how you think about the music and related trends. [title] Steer clear of the \" what's indie, what's indie-animal \" mentality.\n  B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. [substeps] If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.\n  C: [substeps] Never allow the messenger back into your life. If you are in a relationship with someone but they are choosing to change with you, leave the conversation.\n  D: You don't have to assume how you will feel. What's more, you probably know a bit more about people who just want to blend in with their surroundings.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always consider the context and meaning of key concepts in the question.\n* Always evaluate each option in relation to the question's message and context.\n* Never choose an option based on assumptions or preconceived notions.\n* Always double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the question's message and context.\n"

I assumed that option A was the correct answer because it mentioned music and trends, but upon closer examination, option B is more closely related to the idea of being independent and making independent decisions, which is the main message of the text. I will make sure to carefully read the question and evaluate each option in relation to the question's message and context in the future."
