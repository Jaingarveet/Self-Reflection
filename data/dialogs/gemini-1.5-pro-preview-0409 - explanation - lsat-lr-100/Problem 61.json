The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

The correct answer should be the option that, if false, would most likely invalidate the conclusion that one type of memory doesn't decline with age. \n## Analysis of Choices:\n*   **A:** Having the same number of people in each group ensures a balanced comparison, making it helpful for the conclusion.\n*   **B:** The consistency of researchers answering the calls is irrelevant to the memory aspect being studied.\n*   **C:**  While ensuring all college students are under forty reinforces the age difference, it doesn't significantly impact the memory comparison.\n*   **D:** Equal access to telephones ensures both groups had the same opportunity to make the calls, supporting the validity of the conclusion.\n*   **E:**  **This is crucial.** If the groups received instructions at vastly different times, it could significantly impact their ability to remember, making the comparison unfair and undermining the conclusion. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
