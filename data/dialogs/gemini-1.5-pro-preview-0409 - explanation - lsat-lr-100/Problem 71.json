It should be a logical conclusion that directly follows from the curator's statements.\n**Applying the Learning:**\nFor this attempt, I will focus on identifying the statement that is a direct and unavoidable consequence of the curator's statements, ensuring it holds true in all possible scenarios. \n## Answering the Question:\nAnalyzing each option:\n*   **A:** This may not be true as the store sells prints of works not in the museum's collection (e.g., Nighthawks).\n*   **B:** This must be true. The curator states the museum only displays 20th-century works, and the store only sells prints of displayed works.\n*   **C:** This may not be true as the store may not have prints of every single work in the permanent collection.\n*   **D:** This may not be true as Nighthawks is specifically stated as not being part of the permanent collection.\n*   **E:** This may not be true as Nighthawks could be on display even if it's not part of the permanent collection.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is that all prints sold are copies of 20th-century works. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
