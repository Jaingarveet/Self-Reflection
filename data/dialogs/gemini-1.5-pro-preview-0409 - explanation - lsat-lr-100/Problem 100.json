Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

The key to strengthening the argument is to find an option that directly supports the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery as perceived by lawmakers.\n## Analysis:\n*   **A:** This is a general principle of lawmaking but doesn't specifically address the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery.\n*   **B:** Similar to A, it discusses the general process of criminalizing acts but doesn't directly support the argument.\n*   **C:** This option talks about increasing penalties for unusually harmful instances, which is not relevant to the comparison between theft and bribery.\n*   **D:** This option directly supports the argument by stating that victims of theft and bribery experience similar levels of harm, aligning with the lawmakers' perspective. \n*   **E:** This option discusses the effectiveness of proportional penalties in deterring crime, which is not relevant to the comparison of harm between theft and bribery.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the choice that most strengthens the argument is the one that directly supports the equivalence of harm between theft and bribery as perceived by lawmakers.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
