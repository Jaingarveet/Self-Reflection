On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

This led me to incorrectly choose option A. However, the key to understanding this argument lies in recognizing the assumption that a **consistent policy cannot hold contradictory views**.\n## Analyzing the Choices:\n*   **A:** This focuses on the inconsistency between words and actions of a legislator, not the policy itself. \n*   **B:** This discusses long-term spending reduction, which is not the focus of the argument.\n*   **C:** This introduces a moral dilemma not present in the editorial.\n*   **D:** This directly addresses the assumption that a consistent policy cannot advocate for a worthy goal while simultaneously opposing actions to achieve it. \n*   **E:** This is a generalization about political parties and not relevant to the argument.\n## Conclusion:\nThe editorial assumes that a consistent political policy wouldn't contradict itself by supporting a goal while opposing actions to achieve it. \n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
