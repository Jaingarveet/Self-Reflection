What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it covers in 5 seconds. However, I made an error in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I added the distance covered in 5 seconds to the distance traveled in 40 seconds instead of adding it to the length of the space shuttle. \nError Keywords:\n - Addition error\n - Calculation error\n - Misinterpretation of the problem\nSolution:\nThe space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.\nIt takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.\nLet's assume the length of the space shuttle is \"L\".\nDuring the 40 seconds, the space shuttle covers a distance of 17.5L m.\nThe total distance covered by the space shuttle is the sum of the distance covered in 40 seconds and the distance covered in 5 seconds.\nTotal distance = 17.5L + 87.5\nBut we know that the total distance is 700m.\nTherefore, 17.5L + 87.5 = 700\n17.5L = 612.5\nL = 35\nThe length of the space shuttle is 35 x 2 = 70m.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.\n2. Identify the given information and what needs to be found.\n3. Use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.\n4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n5. If the answer is not among the choices, recheck your calculations.\n6. If the answer is still not among the choices, consider if you have misinterpreted the problem.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and understand the question.\n - Identify the given information and what needs to be found.\n - Use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.\n - Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - If the answer is not among the choices, recheck your calculations.\n - If the answer is still not among the choices, consider if you have misinterpreted the problem.\n"
