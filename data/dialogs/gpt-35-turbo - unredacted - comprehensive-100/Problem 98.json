Understand the role of aminoacyl t-RNA in protein synthesis.\n2. Know which amino acids require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.\n3. Identify the amino acid in the question.\n4. Determine if the amino acid requires aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your determination.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always review your knowledge of the topic before answering the question.\n - Always be specific in your understanding of the topic.\n - Never assume that your general knowledge is sufficient for specific questions.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
