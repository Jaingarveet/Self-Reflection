Understand the characteristics of each ovarian tumor type.\n2. Identify the ovarian tumor that is most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy.\n3. Choose the correct answer based on your knowledge of ovarian tumors and pregnancy.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always recall the characteristics of each disease or condition.\n - Always interpret the information correctly.\n - Never guess the answer if you are not sure.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that some diseases or conditions may have similar characteristics, but they may differ in some aspects.\n"
