        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy mistake was in assuming that F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves if G is placed on the top shelf. However, the problem only states that at least two books are placed on each shelf, not that all books are placed on the middle and bottom shelves. \nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misreading the problem\n - Overgeneralization\nSolution:\nIf G is placed on the top shelf, then at least two books are placed on each shelf. \nI is placed on the middle shelf, so at least one book is placed on the bottom shelf.\nK is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf with L, M, and O.\nO is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L and M.\nF is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the same shelf as K or O.\nTherefore, the only possible arrangement is:\nTop shelf: G, H\nMiddle shelf: I, K, O\nBottom shelf: F, L, M\nThe books placed on the middle shelf are I, K, and L.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify all given conditions.\n2. Avoid making assumptions beyond what is stated in the problem.\n3. Use the given conditions to eliminate impossible arrangements.\n4. Deduce the possible arrangements based on the given conditions.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and understand the given conditions.\n - Avoid making assumptions beyond what is stated in the problem.\n - Use the given conditions to eliminate impossible arrangements.\n - Deduce the possible arrangements based on the given conditions.\n - Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that at least two books are placed on each shelf, not necessarily all books.\n"
