Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question stem. I thought that I needed to find an option that strengthens the argument. However, the question asked for an option that weakens the argument. \nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding\n - Misinterpretation\n - Careless reading\nSolution:\nThe argument states that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town and that the average citizen is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. We need to find an option that weakens this argument.\nOption A is irrelevant to the argument.\nOption B is also irrelevant to the argument.\nOption C strengthens the argument by stating that more people are willing to report violent crimes.\nOption D is irrelevant to the argument.\nOption E weakens the argument by stating that a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question stem carefully.\n2. Identify the argument presented in the question stem.\n3. Identify the options presented in the question.\n4. Evaluate each option to determine whether it strengthens or weakens the argument.\n5. Choose the option that most weakens the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question stem carefully.\n - Identify the argument presented in the question stem.\n - Identify the options presented in the question.\n - Evaluate each option to determine whether it strengthens or weakens the argument.\n - Choose the option that most weakens the argument.\n"
