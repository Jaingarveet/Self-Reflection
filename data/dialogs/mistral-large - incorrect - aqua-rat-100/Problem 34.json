Therefore, I need to round the calculated percentage to the nearest whole number.\n-4.8% rounded to the nearest whole number is -5%.\n\nSince none of the given choices match the calculated percentage of loss, I need to select the closest answer.\nThe closest answer is \"E: 4% Loss\".\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
