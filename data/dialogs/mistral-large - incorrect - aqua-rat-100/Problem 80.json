This means that there is an error in the problem statement or in the answer choices.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\nNote: Since the instruction says that I MUST select one of the available choices, I will select the closest answer, which is \"D: 5,6\". However, this answer is still incorrect, and the problem statement or the answer choices are likely incorrect."
