The least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers.\n\nLet's call the two integers a and b. We know that:\n\n* GCF(a, b) = 11\n* LCM(a, b) = 7700\n* a = 350\n\nWe can use the following formula to find the other integer:\n\n* a \\* b = GCF(a, b) \\* LCM(a, b)\n\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n\n* 350 \\* b = 11 \\* 7700\n* b = (11 \\* 7700) / 350\n* b = 242\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
