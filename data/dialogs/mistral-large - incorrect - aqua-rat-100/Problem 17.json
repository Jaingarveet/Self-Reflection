        "content": "Thought:\nTo find the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to first calculate the total production cost for the year.\n\nThe company produces 420 units per month, and the production cost per unit is $110. Therefore, the monthly production cost is 420 \\* $110 = $46,200.\n\nSince there are 12 months in a year, the total production cost for the year is $46,200 \\* 12 = $554,400.\n\nTo guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the total revenue from sales must be at least $554,400 (production cost) + $626,400 (desired profit) = $1,180,800.\n\nThe company sells 420 units per month, so it sells 420 \\* 12 = 5,040 units per year.\n\nTo find the minimum selling price per component, we can divide the total revenue by the number of units sold: $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.29.\n\nSince we need to choose from the given choices, we should select the closest option that is greater than or equal to $234.29.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\") (The closest option that is greater than or equal to $234.29 is $260.)"
