However, not all combinations will result in a valid quadrilateral.\n\nWe can form quadrilaterals in two ways:\n1. Selecting 3 vertices of the pentagon and the center point (F). This will result in a kite-shaped quadrilateral. There are 5 ways to do this since there are 5 vertices.\n2. Selecting 4 vertices of the pentagon. This will result in a rhombus-shaped quadrilateral. However, since the pentagon is regular, only one such quadrilateral can be formed by selecting any 4 consecutive vertices.\n\nSo, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is 5 (kites) + 1 (rhombus) = 6. But this is not an option in the given choices. I must have made a mistake.\n\nLet's reconsider the second case. Instead of selecting 4 consecutive vertices, we can select any 4 vertices. This will result in a crossed quadrilateral (or self-intersecting quadrilateral). There are 5 ways to do this since there are 5 ways to select 4 vertices out of 5.\n\nSo, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is 5 (kites) + 5 (crossed quadrilaterals) = 10.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
