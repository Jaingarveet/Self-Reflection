Let's call the distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes \"x\".\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can set up two equations:\n\n1. tan(45°) = h/x+y\n2. tan(60°) = h/x\n\nwhere h is the height of the tower and y is the distance the car will travel after 10 minutes to reach the base of the tower.\n\nSolving these equations, we get:\n\n1. x+y = h\n2. x = h/√3\n\nSubstituting x from the second equation into the first equation, we get:\n\ny = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel distance y. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the ratio of distances traveled is equal to the ratio of times taken. Therefore:\n\ny/x = t/10\n\nwhere t is the time it takes for the car to travel distance y.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for x and y from above, we get:\n\nh(√3 - 1)/√3 / h/√3 = t/10\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nt = 10(√3 - 1)\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
