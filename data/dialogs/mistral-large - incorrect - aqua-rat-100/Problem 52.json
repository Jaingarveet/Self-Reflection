        "content": "Thought:\nFirst, I need to find the amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y separately.\nThe ratio of zinc and copper in alloy X is 6:9, so there are 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper. Since 40 grams of alloy X is melted, each part is equal to 40/(6+9) = 2.5 grams. Therefore, alloy X has 6\\*2.5 = 15 grams of zinc and 9\\*2.5 = 22.5 grams of copper.\nSimilarly, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Y is 7:11, so there are 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper. Since 60 grams of alloy Y is melted, each part is equal to 60/(7+11) = 3 grams. Therefore, alloy Y has 7\\*3 = 21 grams of zinc and 11\\*3 = 33 grams of copper.\nNow, I can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts in alloy X and alloy Y. Alloy Z has 15+21 = 36 grams of zinc and 22.5+33 = 55.5 grams of copper.\nFinally, I need to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z. The ratio is 36:55.5, which simplifies to 59:91.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
