        "content": "Thought:\nThe sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5. Since the sum is also divisible by 10, it must be divisible by the least common multiple of 5 and 10, which is 10. Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must end in a 0.\n\nLet's denote the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers as x. Then the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is:\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20\n\nSince the sum is divisible by 10, x must be even. Therefore, the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be an even number plus 1, which is an odd number.\n\nThe sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers divided by 10 is a perfect square. Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be a multiple of 10 and a perfect square. The smallest such number is 100, which is the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27.\n\nTherefore, the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be less than or equal to 27. The only option that satisfies this condition is 41.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
