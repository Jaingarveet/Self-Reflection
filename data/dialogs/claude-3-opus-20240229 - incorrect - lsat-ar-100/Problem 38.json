        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know there are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. \n2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf, and there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n3. The question states that G is on the top shelf. \n4. I must be on the middle shelf according to the conditions.\n5. K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M. Since there are more books on the bottom than the top, this means F and M must be on the bottom shelf, and K must be on the middle or top shelf.\n6. O is on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the middle or bottom shelf, and O must be on the top or middle shelf.\n7. Since I is on the middle shelf, and F and M are on the bottom shelf, the only place for L is also the bottom shelf. This puts O on either the top or middle shelf.\n8. H is the only unplaced book. It could go on any of the shelves while satisfying the conditions.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: H, I - This is possible. I must be on the middle shelf, and H could be there too.\nB: I, L - This is not possible. L must be on the bottom shelf.\nC: H, I, L - This is not possible. L must be on the bottom shelf.\nD: I, K, L - This is not possible. L must be on the bottom shelf.\nE: F, I, M - This is not possible. F and M must be on the bottom shelf.\nTherefore, the only possible answer is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
