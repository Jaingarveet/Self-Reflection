Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone.\n4. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone. \n5. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2.\n6. The question states Mahr and Stuckey are in the same zone.\nGiven 4 and 6, Mahr, Stuckey and Udall must all be in the same zone. \nIf they were in Zone 1, then by 2, Tiao would have to be in Zone 2. But then by 1, Parra would have to be in Zone 3 with Quinn. This would leave only Kim for Zone 2, violating condition 5. So they can't be in Zone 1.\nIf they were in Zone 2, then by 2, Tiao would have to be in Zone 1 or 3. If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, leaving only Kim for Zone 2, violating condition 5. If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn could be in Zone 1, but this still leaves only Kim for Zone 2, again violating condition 5. So they can't be in Zone 2.\nTherefore, Mahr, Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3. This means:\n- By 2, Tiao must be in Zone 1\n- By 1 and 3, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 2\n- This leaves Kim as the only possibility for the 4th person in Zone 3\nSo the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
