        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We are told that both G and H are selected for the panel. Since G and H are both botanists, this means the panel has more than one botanist.\n2. One of the conditions states: \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\" \n3. Since we have more than one botanist (G and H), we can have at most one zoologist on the panel.\n4. The choices involve different combinations of scientists. Let's go through them one by one:\n   A: F or else K - F is a botanist and K is a chemist. This doesn't tell us anything about the zoologists, so it may or may not be true.\n   \n   B: F or else M - Similar to A, F is a botanist and M is a chemist. Again, no information about zoologists.\n   \n   C: K or else M - Both are chemists. No information about zoologists.\n   \n   D: M or else Q - M is a chemist, Q is a zoologist. This could potentially work, as we can have at most one zoologist.\n   \n   E: P or else Q - Both P and Q are zoologists. But we can only have at most one zoologist. So this cannot be true.\n5. Therefore, the only choice that must be true is D: the panel must include either M or else Q.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
