Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Young must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson. Since Robertson has #3, the only options for Young are #1 and #2. \n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered space than Young. Since Young has to be in #1 or #2, the only option for Togowa is #1.\n4. So if Robertson is in #3, then Young must be in #2 (to be lower than Robertson but higher than Togowa).\n5. Xu must be higher than Souza. The remaining spots are #4, #5 and #6. Souza and Xu could be arranged in any of those in a way that fits this rule.\n6. Vaughn gets whichever of #4, #5 or #6 is left after assigning Xu and Souza.\nTherefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #2.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
