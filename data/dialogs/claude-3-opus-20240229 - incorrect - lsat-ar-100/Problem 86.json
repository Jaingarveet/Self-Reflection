So textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. \n3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Since textiles is in either bay 3 or 5, livestock must be in a higher numbered bay. It can't be bay 4 (produce) or bay 5 (the only option higher than bay 3 for textiles). So livestock must be in bay 6.\n4. The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. But livestock is in the highest numbered bay (6), so this is impossible. There is no arrangement that satisfies all the conditions.\nSince the given information leads to an impossible situation, not all the bays can be determined. The question asks for the number of bays that are completely determined. We know for sure the cargo of two bays: bay 4 (produce) and bay 6 (livestock).\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
