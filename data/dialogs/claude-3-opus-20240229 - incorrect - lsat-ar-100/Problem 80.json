Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

This eliminates choices C and D, which have Togowa in a higher space than Young.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This eliminates choice A, which has Souza in a higher space than Xu. \n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This eliminates choice B, which has Young in a higher space than Robertson.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. The only remaining choice that satisfies this is E, which has Robertson in space #4.\nTherefore, the only assignment that satisfies all the given rules is:\n#1: Souza \n#2: Togowa\n#3: Young\n#4: Robertson\n#5: Xu\n#6: Vaughn\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
