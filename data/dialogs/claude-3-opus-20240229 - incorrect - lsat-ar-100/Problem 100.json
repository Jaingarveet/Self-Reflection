There must be at least two compositions between F and R (in either order). So the sequence cannot contain \"FR\" or \"RF\".\n3. O must be either first or fifth. \n4. The eighth (last) composition must be either L or H.\n5. P must come before S.\n6. There must be at least one composition between O and S (in either order). So the sequence cannot contain \"OS\" or \"SO\".\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H - Violates condition 3 as O is neither first nor fifth.\nB: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L - Violates condition 1 as T is not immediately before F or after R.\nC: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H - Violates condition 6 as there is no composition between S and O.\nD: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H - This satisfies all conditions. P is before S, T is immediately before F, O is fifth, L is eighth, and there are compositions between F and R and between S and O.\nE: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H - Violates condition 2 as there are not at least two compositions between F and R.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
