This totals 4 works.\nB: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected.\nThis violates the constraint that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. So this is not possible.\nC: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected.\nThis is possible. 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel (to make 3 novels total), and the Russian play totals 4 works. \nD: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.\nThis is possible. 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel (3 novels), 1 French play, and 1 Russian play (2 plays) totals 5 works.\nE: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\nThis violates the constraint that the number of French novels must be ≥ the number of Russian novels. So this is not possible.\nTherefore, the answer that could NOT be true is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
