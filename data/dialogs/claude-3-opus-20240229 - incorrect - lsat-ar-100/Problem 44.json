Himalayans are featured on exactly 3 days, but not day 1. They also can't be featured on the same day as Rottweilers. \n3. Rottweilers can't be featured on day 7 or any day with Himalayans.\n4. No breed can be featured on consecutive days.\nLet's consider each answer choice:\nA: If Greyhounds are on days 3 and 5, this violates the rule of no breed on consecutive days. Eliminate A.\nB: Newfoundlands on day 3 doesn't violate any rules so far. Keep B.\nC: Rottweilers on day 6 doesn't violate any rules. Keep C.\nD: Rottweilers only on day 3 doesn't violate any rules. Keep D.\nE: Rottweilers on exactly 3 days is impossible. They can't be with Himalayans (3 days) or on day 7. At most they have 3 available days (2, 4, 6). Eliminate E.\nOf the remaining options, B, C and D are all possible without violating any rules, assuming Himalayans aren't on day 7.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
