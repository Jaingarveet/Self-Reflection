O must be performed either 1st or 5th. Since P is 3rd, O must be performed 5th.\n3. The 8th composition is either L or H. \n4. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R.\n5. There must be at least two compositions either between F and R, or between R and F.\n6. There must be at least one composition either between O and S, or between S and O. We know O is 5th and S is 6th, so this condition is satisfied.\nPutting this together:\n- O is definitely performed 5th\n- P is 3rd \n- S is 6th\n- The 8th is L or H\nThe only possible orders that satisfy all conditions are:\n1. _ , _ , P , _ , O , S , _ , L/H\n2. _ , _ , P , _ , O , S , _ , L/H\nWhere the blanks can be filled by the remaining compositions F, H/L, R, T following the other conditions.\nTherefore, the composition performed 5th must be O.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
