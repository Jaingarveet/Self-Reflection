Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. This means one of them must be in Zone 1, and the other must be in either Zone 2 or 3.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Similar to the first condition, one of Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2, and the other is in Zone 1 or 3. \n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. So they are either both in Zone 1, both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Again, they are either both in Zone 1, both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.\n5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This is a key piece of information.\nNow, let's consider the answer choices:\nA: Kim, Mahr - This could be possible for Zone 3, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\nB: Kim, Tiao - This violates condition 4, as Tiao and Udall must be in the same zone.\nC: Parra, Quinn - This could be possible for Zone 3, but again, we don't have enough information to confirm it.\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This violates conditions 1 and 2, as Tiao cannot be in the same zone as both Parra and Udall.\nE: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This satisfies all conditions. Parra and Quinn are together (condition 3), Stuckey and Udall are together (condition 4), and there are 4 people in Zone 3, which is more than in Zone 2 (condition 5).\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
