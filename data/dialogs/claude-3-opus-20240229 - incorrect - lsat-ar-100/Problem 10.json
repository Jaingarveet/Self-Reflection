This means 1-4 French works.\n3. At least 3 novels but no more than 4 novels must be selected. \n4. The number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.\n5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.\nNow let's evaluate each choice:\nA. 1 French novel, 2 Russian novels, 1 French play, 1 Russian play\n   - This has 5 works total, 3 novels, and 2 French works.
