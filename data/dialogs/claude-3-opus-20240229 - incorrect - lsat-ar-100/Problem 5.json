        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom). \n2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf. With 8 books total, the only way to arrange this is 2-2-4 or 2-3-3.\n3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So it must be a 2-3-3 arrangement (2 on top, 3 in middle, 3 on bottom).\n4. I is on the middle shelf. \n5. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So F and M must be on the bottom, and K must be on the middle or top.\n6. O is on a higher shelf than L. So L must be on the middle or bottom, and O must be higher than L.\n7. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A) This could be true, but doesn't have to be. O and M could be on the same shelf.\n   B) We don't know where G is placed, so this may or may not be true.\n   C) This must be true. I is on the middle shelf. F is on the bottom shelf with M. So I is definitely higher than F.\n   D) This may or may not be true, depending on where G and O are placed.\n   E) This may or may not be true, depending on where L is placed.\nTherefore, C is the only statement that must be true based on the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
