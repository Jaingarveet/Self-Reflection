At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf.

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know I is on the middle shelf. \n2. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n3. K is on a higher shelf than F. F and M are on the same shelf.\n4. O is on a higher shelf than L.\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA) If I and M are on the same (middle) shelf, then F is also on the middle shelf. But this doesn't determine the shelves for the other books. Not enough info.\nB) If K and G are on the same shelf, this could be either the top or middle shelf (since K is above F). But it doesn't specify, so this doesn't fully determine the arrangement.\nC) If L and F are on the same shelf, this must be the bottom shelf (since O is above L, and more books are on the bottom than top). Then M is also on the bottom. I is on the middle. K, G, H, O are left for the 2 spots on top and remaining middle spot. But it's not fully determined.\nD) If M and H are on the same shelf as F, this must be the bottom shelf. I is on the middle. That leaves K, G, L, O for the 2 top spots and 1 remaining middle spot. O must be on top since it's above L. But we can't distinguish the exact spots of K, G and L.\nE) If H and O are on the same shelf, it must be the top shelf, since O is above L. Then L must be middle or bottom. I is middle. F and M are together, so must be bottom to satisfy the \"more on bottom than top\" condition. This fully determines it: H, O top; I, L middle; F, M, K, G bottom.\nTherefore, E is the only choice that fully determines the shelf arrangement.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
