Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n6. The question states: \"If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3...\"\nNow, let's consider each answer choice:\nA. Kim works in Zone 2. This could be true, as we don't have any information about where Kim works.\nB. Mahr works in Zone 2. This could also be true, as we don't have any information about where Mahr works.\nC. Parra works in Zone 3. This can't be true. If more reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, and Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, then Parra must work in Zone 1.\nD. Tiao works in Zone 1. This could be true, as condition 1 states that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.\nE. Udall works in Zone 3. This can't be true. If Udall worked in Zone 3, then per condition 4, Stuckey would also work in Zone 3. But then there would be more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 1, contradicting the premise.\nTherefore, of the given choices, only A, B, or D could be true.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
