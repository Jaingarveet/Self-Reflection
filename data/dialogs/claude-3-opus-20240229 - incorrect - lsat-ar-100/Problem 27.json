The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So any complete list of students who review Tamerlane must include both Kramer and O'Neill.\n2. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means Megregian reviews at least 2 plays. \n3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, neither Lopez nor Megregian can be on the list.\n4. Exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other. The only pair we know for sure review a common play is Kramer and O'Neill (Tamerlane). So no other pair can completely overlap.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: Jiang, Kramer - Incorrect, missing O'Neill who must review Tamerlane \nB: Kramer, O'Neill - Could be correct, satisfies all conditions\nC: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill - Incorrect, violates condition that exactly 2 students review the same play(s)\nD: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill - Incorrect, if Megregian reviews Tamerlane he would review at least as many plays as Kramer\nE: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill - Incorrect, missing Kramer who must review Tamerlane\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Kramer and O'Neill could be a complete list of the students who review Tamerlane.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
