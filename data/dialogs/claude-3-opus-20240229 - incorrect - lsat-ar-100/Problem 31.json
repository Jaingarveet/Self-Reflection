Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?\nChoices:\n  A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  B: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\n  C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\n  D: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  E: oatmeal: Monday, Thursday, Friday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

At least one batch is made on Monday. Let's assume it's a batch of oatmeal cookies for now.\n3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. So the other two batches must be on Monday and one other day (not Thursday).\n4. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. \n   If oatmeal starts Monday, the second batch can't be Monday or Thursday (sugar cookie day). Let's say it's Tuesday.\n   So peanut butter is also made Tuesday, and must have two other non-Tuesday days.\n5. Looking at the answer choices, only B and D have oatmeal on Monday and Tuesday, and sugar on Monday and Thursday.\n6. Between B and D, only D has peanut butter not on Tuesday, fitting the criteria.\nTherefore, the answer that fits all the conditions is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
