The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be\nChoices:\n  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant\n  B: the pharmacy and the toy store\n  C: the two restaurants\n  D: a restaurant and the toy store\n  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Let's call this pair the \"O-S pair\".\n3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is in the O-S pair, the pharmacy must be on one side of this pair.\n4. On the other side of the O-S pair, we can't have the veterinarian, because the toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. \n5. We also can't have the other restaurant on this side, because the two restaurants need to be separated by at least two businesses.\n6. This leaves only the toy store as an option for the other side of the O-S pair.\nTherefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
