The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n3. From 1 and 2, we can deduce the order is textiles < livestock < grain.\n4. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n5. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n6. From 4 and 5, produce must be in a higher numbered bay than textiles. So the order is: fuel < textiles < produce.\n7. Combining the deductions from 3 and 6: fuel < textiles < livestock < grain < produce\n8. The question is asking what CANNOT be in bay 4. Looking at the order in 7, we see that livestock must be in either bay 3 or 4. If livestock is in bay 4, then it CANNOT be in bay 3.\nTherefore, the cargo that CANNOT be in bay 4 is textiles.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
