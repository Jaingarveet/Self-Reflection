        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.\n2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Given the third solo is traditional, either the 2nd and 3rd solos are both traditional, or the 3rd and 4th solos are both traditional. \n3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the 3rd and 4th solos are both traditional (to satisfy condition 2), then Wayne must perform the 4th solo. \n4. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. So Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the 1st or 2nd solo.\n5. The pianist who performs the 2nd solo does not perform the 5th solo. This doesn't directly impact the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.\nPutting this together:\n- Wayne must perform at least one modern piece in the 1st or 2nd solo\n- If the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces, Wayne must perform the 4th solo\n- Otherwise, Wayne may not need to perform any traditional pieces\nTherefore, the minimum number of traditional pieces Wayne must perform is one (in the 4th solo if the 3rd and 4th are the consecutive traditional pieces).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
