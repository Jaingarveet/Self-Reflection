The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This means neither of them can be among the three reviewing Undulation.\n2. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. If 3 students review Undulation, Megregian must be one of them. Otherwise he would review 2 plays maximum, same as Kramer and Lopez.\n3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviewed Undulation, Lopez and Megregian could not, contradicting the previous point. Therefore, Jiang does not review Undulation.\n4. Exactly two students review the same plays as each other. If O'Neill also reviewed Sunset along with Tamerlane, he would review the same plays as Kramer. This satisfies the condition.\n5. In summary: Megregian, Lopez and one other student (not Jiang, Kramer or O'Neill) review Undulation. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and Sunset.\nTherefore, the statement that could be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
