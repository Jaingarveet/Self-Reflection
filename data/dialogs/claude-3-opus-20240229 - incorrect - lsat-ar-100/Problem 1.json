At least one witness testifies on Monday. Combined with condition 2, this means either one or two witnesses testify on Monday, and the remaining one or two testify on Wednesday along with Iturbe.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday. \n5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. \n   This is possible. Garcia, Hong and Jackson could be scheduled for Tuesday, and Iturbe on Wednesday.\nB: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. \n   This is possible. Franco and Iturbe could testify on Wednesday, with Garcia, Hong and Jackson on Monday and Tuesday.\nC: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n   This is possible. They could be the two witnesses testifying on Tuesday.\nD: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n   This is impossible. We know Hong cannot testify on Monday, so if Garcia is the only one on Monday, Hong must be on Tuesday or Wednesday. But we also know Iturbe must be on Wednesday and exactly two witnesses are on Tuesday. So Hong cannot be on Wednesday.\nE: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n   This is possible. Two of Franco, Garcia, and Hong could testify on Monday, Jackson and the remaining one on Tuesday, and Iturbe on Wednesday.\nTherefore, the only choice that CANNOT be true is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
