        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my evaluation of choice [REDACTED]. I incorrectly stated that it violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. However, upon closer examination, the pharmacy is indeed at one end of the row in choice [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n - Evaluation error\n - Constraint violation error\n - End of the row error\n\nSolution:\nThe pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7.\nOne of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7, but not the same space as the pharmacy.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.\nThe pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 2, and it cannot be in space 7 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 6.\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.\n\nLet's evaluate each choice:\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice satisfies all the constraints.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice satisfies all the constraints.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the constraints given in the problem.\n2. Evaluate each choice against the constraints.\n3. Eliminate any choices that violate the constraints.\n4. Choose the answer that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your evaluation of each choice against the constraints.\n - Remember that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.\n - Remember that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\n - Remember that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n - Remember that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n"
