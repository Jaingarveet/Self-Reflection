        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?\nChoices:\n  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.\n  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.\n  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.\n  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? \"The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand.\"\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I did not carefully consider the information provided in each choice. I focused too much on the percentage increase in housing prices compared to land prices, rather than the actual increase in land prices.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation of data\n* Lack of attention to detail\n* Incorrect comparison\n\nSolution:\nThe assertion is that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.\nChoice [REDACTED] shows that housing prices increased significantly more than land prices, but the actual increase in land prices is still significant.\nChoice [REDACTED] shows that land prices rose very little compared to housing prices, which casts doubt on the assertion.\nChoice [REDACTED] is an opinion that supports the assertion.\nChoice [REDACTED] is an opinion that contradicts the assertion.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the assertion being made.\n2. Consider each choice and the information it provides.\n3. Compare the information in each choice to the assertion.\n4. Determine which choice casts the most doubt on the assertion.\n5. Choose the answer that corresponds to that choice.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Pay attention to the details in each choice.\n* Compare the information in each choice to the assertion being made.\n* Consider the actual values, not just the percentages.\n* Choose the answer that casts the most doubt on the assertion.\n"
