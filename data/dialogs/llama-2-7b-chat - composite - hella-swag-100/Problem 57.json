I selected option A, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is not the correct answer. A trough tip is actually best for decorating tall pipe cupcakes, but it is not the most likely completion to the text.\n\nThe correct answer is option B: If you prefer a slightly more conspicuous overall appearance, you can have multiple different cupcake designs in one shot before using one cupcake. This option best completes the text as it suggests the idea of creating multiple designs in one shot, which is the main point of the text.\n\nAdvice: When answering questions, it is important to carefully read and understand the text before selecting an answer. Reflecting on your previous answers and considering alternative options can also help you arrive at the correct answer."
