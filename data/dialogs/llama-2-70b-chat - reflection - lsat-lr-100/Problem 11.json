Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now.\nQuestion: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument\nChoices:\n  A: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause\n  B: infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause\n  C: overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live\n  D: takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile\n  E: takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles\n\n  Answer: C\n\nThe argument overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live. It assumes that the current geography of modern cities is solely a result of the personal automobile, ignoring the impact of other technological advancements such as public transportation, bicycles, or ride-sharing services. Therefore, option C is the best answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument's reasoning is questionable because it infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause (the personal automobile) that it could only have resulted from that cause. The argument ignores the possibility that other factors, such as changes in urban planning policies or economic conditions, may have also played a role in shaping the modern cityscape.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Inference\n- Causality\n- Single-cause fallacy\n\nSolution:\nThe argument should consider the possibility that other factors, in addition to the personal automobile, have contributed to the development of modern cities. The argument should also provide evidence to support the claim that the personal automobile was the sole cause of the observed urban planning patterns.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the main cause-and-effect relationship presented in the argument.\n2. Consider alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect.\n3. Evaluate the strength of the evidence provided to support the main cause-and-effect relationship.\n4. If necessary, revise the argument to address any weaknesses in the evidence or reasoning.\n\nAdvice:\n- Be aware of the potential for single-cause fallacies in arguments.\n- Consider alternative explanations for observed phenomena.\n- Look for evidence that supports or undermines the main cause-and-effect relationship.\n- Be open to revising your initial conclusion based on new information or perspectives."
