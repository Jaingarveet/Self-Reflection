This information supports the idea that if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in that neighborhood.

This suggests that residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, including cocker spaniels, than residents of other neighborhoods.
