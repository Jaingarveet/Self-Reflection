Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.\nQuestion: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that\nChoices:\n  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably\n  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets\n  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets\n  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees\n  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer\n\n  Answer: E\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument assumes that the correlation between high-fther diets and low colon cancer rates is causal, with fther consumption being the sole factor responsible for the difference. However, this overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fther may also play a role in preventing colon cancer. Choice E acknowledges this by stating that foods containing fther also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer. Therefore, it is not just the fther itself that is responsible for the reduced cancer risk, but also other components of fther-rich foods. This weakens the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
