        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.\n  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.\n  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.\n  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.\n  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.\n\n  Answer: D\n\nThe fact that Carl previously solved only 1 out of 30 crimes in another police department seriously weakens the argument that he is an incompetent detective. It suggests that Carl has a consistent track record of low success in solving crimes, which undermines the idea that his low success rate in the last 3 years is due to his incompetence. It could be that Carl is simply not skilled at solving crimes, regardless of his abilities as a detective. Therefore, choice D weakens the argument.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is A, because it provides an alternative explanation for Carl's low success rate in solving crimes. If the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective and assigns him only the most difficult cases that others have failed to solve, then it's possible that Carl's low success rate is not due to his incompetence, but rather due to the difficulty of the cases he's been assigned. This weakens the argument that Carl is an incompetent detective.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect answer format\n* Did not address the argument presented in the question\n* Did not provide a clear explanation for the answer choice\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
