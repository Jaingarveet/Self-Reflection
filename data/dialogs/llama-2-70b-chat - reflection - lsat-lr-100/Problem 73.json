But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.\nQuestion: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that\nChoices:\n  A: the press can publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives\n  B: one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it\n  C: the publishing of information about the personal lives of private individuals cannot be libelous\n  D: if one has an obligation to do something then one has a right to do it\n  E: the press's right to publish always outweighs the individual's right not to be libeled\n\n  Answer: \"B\"\n\nThe argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it.\n\nThe argument assumes that the press has an obligation to publish any story of interest to the public, simply because they have the right to do so. However, this does not necessarily follow. Just because the press has the right to publish a story, it does not mean that they are obligated to do so. The press may choose to exercise their right to publish, or they may choose not to, depending on various factors such as ethical considerations, public interest, and the potential impact on private individuals. Therefore, choice \"B\" is the best answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
