On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\n\n  Answer: \"A\"\n\nThe editorial argues that the political party's policy is inconsistent because they have expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but have also claimed that the government should not increase spending on education.\n\nThe assumption behind this argument is that it is inconsistent for a legislator to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education. This is the best description of choice A.\n\nThe other choices do not accurately describe the assumption made in the editorial:\n\nB is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the long-run effects of educational policy.\n\nC is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not suggest that the goal of increasing spending on education is not morally good.\n\nD is the opposite of the assumption made in the editorial. The editorial argues that the political party's policy is inconsistent because they claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but do not support increasing spending on education.\n\nE is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the views of members of other political parties.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
