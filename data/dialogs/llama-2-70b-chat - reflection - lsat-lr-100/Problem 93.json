So no one who knows him will be surprised that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.\n  B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before.\n  C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.\n  D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.\n  E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.\n\n  Answer: \nThe conclusion logically follows if we assume choice C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation. The passage suggests that Ellsworth is self-righteous and offended by suggestions of unethical business practices. If we assume that hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation, then it is possible that Ellsworth's offense is a cover for his own unethical behavior. This assumption supports the conclusion that Ellsworth may be engaged in unethical practices, despite his self-righteousness.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

        "content": "  Action: Answer(E)\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. The passage states that Ellsworth is self-righteous and offended by suggestions of unethical business practices. It is reasonable to assume that people who know Ellsworth expect him to be easily offended, given his self-righteous nature. This expectation does not necessarily imply that Ellsworth is engaged in unethical practices, but it does suggest that his offense may be a result of his self-righteousness rather than any actual wrongdoing.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Assumption\n* Hypocrisy\n* Indignation\n* Offense\n* Self-righteousness\n\nSolution:\n1. Identify the self-righteous person in the passage.\n2. Identify the reason for the person's offense.\n3. Consider the possibility that the person's offense may be a cover for unethical behavior.\n4. Assess whether the person's self-righteousness is the cause of their offense.\n5. Evaluate whether people who know the person expect them to be easily offended.\n6. Choose the answer that aligns with the evaluation.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully.\n2. Identify the key characters and their traits.\n3. Analyze the relationships between the characters and their traits.\n4. Evaluate the assumptions made in the passage.\n5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the information provided.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the passage carefully and identify the key characters and their traits.\n* Analyze the relationships between the characters and their traits.\n* Evaluate the assumptions made in the passage.\n* Choose the answer that logically follows from the information provided.\n* Avoid making assumptions that are not supported by the passage."
