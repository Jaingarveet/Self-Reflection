To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.\n  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.\n  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.\n  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.\n  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games\n\n  Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.\n  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.\n  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.\n  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.\n  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games produced by other companies.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe fact that the copy protection feature makes the game playable for a short period before the user decides to purchase it supports the president's prediction of increased sales. This feature will encourage people who would otherwise copy the game to purchase it instead, thereby increasing sales.\n\nOption A does not directly support the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature and needs to recoup the cost does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.\n\nOption B does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame's market share has shrunk does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.\n\nOption D does not provide support for the president's prediction. Even if Game Review Monthly gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, it does not mean that people who frequently copy games will purchase Ditalgame games instead of copying them.\n\nOption E does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame games are copied more frequently than other games does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
