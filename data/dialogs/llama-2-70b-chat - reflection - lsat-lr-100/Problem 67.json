Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I.\nQuestion: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways?\nChoices:\n  A: It sets out a problem the argument as a whole is designed to resolve.\n  B: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.\n  C: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false.\n  D: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.\n  E: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion.\n\n  Answer: \"E\" It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion.\n\nThe argument suggests that it is difficult or impossible to learn the lessons of history, and that even if we could discover what the lessons are, it is not clear that we could apply them to future situations. Therefore, the assumption that we should learn the lessons of history is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion that it is difficult or impossible to do so.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

The argument is directed toward discrediting the idea that we can learn useful lessons from history, and therefore, the assumption that we should learn the lessons of history is not required to establish the argument's conclusion.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Assumption\n* Conclusion\n* Discrediting\n* Lessons of history\n\nSolution:\n1.
