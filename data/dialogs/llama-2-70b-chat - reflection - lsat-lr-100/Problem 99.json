Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\n\n  Answer: E\n\nThe professor's argument is based on the premise that thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas and make intellectual progress. The conclusion that freedom of thought is not a precondition for intellectual progress logically follows if we assume that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought (choice E).\n\nThe other choices do not support the professor's argument:\n\n* Choice A is not relevant to the professor's argument.\n* Choice B is not stated in the argument.\n* Choice C is the opposite of the professor's argument.\n* Choice D is not related to the professor's argument.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
