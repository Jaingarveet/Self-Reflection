Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action. The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action\n  B: presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems\n  C: infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change\n  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians\n  E: presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems\n\n  Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nThe political scientist's argument assumes that the only reason for decreasing voter turnout is the belief that politicians cannot solve important problems. However, the argument does not provide any evidence or justification for this claim. It ignores the possibility that other factors, such as voter apathy, disillusionment with politics, or lack of interest in the issues being addressed, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout.
