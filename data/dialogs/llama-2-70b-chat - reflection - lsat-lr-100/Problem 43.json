        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love \"until death do us part.\" If \"love\" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\n\n  Answer: \nThe ethicist's conclusion follows logically if choice  is assumed.\nThe ethicist argues that if \"love\" in marital vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love \"until death do us part\" makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control. This argument assumes that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control. Therefore, choice  is the best answer.\n\nIt is not necessary to assume that none of our feelings are within our control (choice  A) or that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense (choice  D) to reach the ethicist's conclusion. Choice  C is incorrect because the ethicist's argument does not rely on the assumption that \"love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings. Choice  E is also incorrect because the ethicist's argument does not rely on the assumption that promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
