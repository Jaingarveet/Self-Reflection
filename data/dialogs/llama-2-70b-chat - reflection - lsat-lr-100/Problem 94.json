Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\nQuestion: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.\n  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.\n  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.\n  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.\n\n  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument \"Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits\" is an example of affirming the antecedent, a type of logical fallacy. The argument assumes that because most mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, therefore, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\n\nThe argument \"Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring\" is also an example of affirming the antecedent. The argument assumes that because most nature photographers find portrait photography boring and most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries, therefore, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n\nThe other options do not exhibit the same pattern of flawed reasoning:\n\nA: This argument is an example of a correlational fallacy, as it assumes that increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints without providing sufficient evidence.\n\nB: This argument is logically sound, as it uses modus ponens to conclude that few birds remain in the region during the winter based on the premises that most common species of birds in the region are migratory and that most migratory birds have left the region by the end of November.\n\nD: This argument is also an example of affirming the antecedent, similar to the argument in option C.\n\nE: This argument is logically sound, as it uses modus ponens to conclude that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer based on the premises that most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer and that most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
