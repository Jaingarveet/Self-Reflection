        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.\n  B: Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.\n  C: Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations.\n  D: A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\n  E: A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\n\n  Answer: E\n\nThe editorial argues that long breaks in the school calendar should be removed because they were originally intended to accommodate agricultural life, which is no longer relevant to most citizens. The editorial suggests that a school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would better serve the interests of children. Therefore, the assumption on which the editorial's argument depends is that a school calendar without long breaks would be more beneficial for children than the current calendar with long breaks.\n\n Choice E, \"A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks,\" accurately reflects this assumption.\n\n The other choices do not accurately reflect the assumption on which the editorial's argument depends.\n\n Choice A, \"During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned,\" may be a potential drawback of long breaks, but it is not an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends.\n\n Choice B, \"Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks,\" is not an accurate statement, as the editorial argues that the current school calendar is outdated and no longer serves the needs of most children.\n\n Choice C, \"Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations,\" is not an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends. While this could be a potential solution, the editorial does not explicitly argue for this.\n\n Choice D, \"A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life,\" is not an accurate statement, as the editorial argues that the current school calendar is no longer relevant to agricultural life and should be changed to better serve the interests of children.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
