Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A recent study shows that those highways that carry the most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested, have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the phenomenon described above?\nChoices:\n  A: Drivers have more accidents when they become distracted.\n  B: The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.\n  C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.\n  D: Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.\n  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.\n\n  Thought: \nThe fact that heavily trafficked highways have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents may seem counterintuitive, but there are several factors that could contribute to this phenomenon. One possible explanation is that drivers on these highways are more cautious and alert due to the high volume of traffic, which could reduce the likelihood of accidents. Another factor could be that heavily trafficked highways tend to have better maintenance, lighting, and safety features compared to less trafficked roads. Additionally, drivers who are commuting to or from work, as suggested in choice C, may be more alert and attentive to their surroundings due to their familiarity with the route.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider the possibility that the lower accident rate on heavily trafficked highways could be due to the fact that vehicles are moving at a lower rate of speed. I was influenced by the fact that the question mentioned that heavily trafficked highways tend to have better maintenance, lighting, and safety features, which led me to choose option C.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misconception\n* Oversight\n* Lack of consideration\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is option D, \"Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.\" This option correctly explains the phenomenon described in the question, as the lower accident rate on heavily trafficked highways could be due to the fact that vehicles are moving at slower speeds, reducing the likelihood of serious accidents.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the phenomenon described.\n2. Consider all the options and evaluate how each one relates to the phenomenon.\n3. Choose the option that best explains the phenomenon.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the phenomenon described.\n* Consider all options and evaluate their relevance to the phenomenon.\n* Avoid being influenced by extraneous information or assumptions.\n* Think critically and logically about the possible explanations for the phenomenon.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it is well-supported by the information provided."
