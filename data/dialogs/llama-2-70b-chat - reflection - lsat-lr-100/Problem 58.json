Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades.\n  B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.\n  C: Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species.\n  D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage.\n  E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations.\n\n  Answer: The correct answer is choice B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.\n\nThe argument states that the macaques' behavior of entering the hot spring was not observed before 1963, but became adopted by the entire troop by 1990. This suggests that the behavior was not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.\n\nThe other choices are not necessarily related to the argument:\n\n* A: Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades. This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not mention genetic mutations.\n* C: Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species. This statement is also not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not mention genetic alterations or typical behaviors.\n* D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage. This statement is false, as social behaviors are influenced by genetics to some extent. However, the argument does not rely on this assumption.\n* E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations. This statement is not necessarily true, as the argument only mentions that the behavior was adopted by the entire troop by 1990, without specifying whether it will persist over several generations.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
