Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

During the fifteen or so years that I have lived here, the few times that I have seen large numbers of dead small fish wash ashore in late summer coincide exactly with the times that I have noticed abnormally large amounts of algae in the water.\nQuestion: The local resident's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\nChoices:\n  A: presumes, without providing justification, that smaller fish are somehow more susceptible to harm as a result of overabundant algae than are larger fish\n  B: fails to consider that the effects on smaller fish of overabundant algae may be less severe in larger bodies of water with more diverse ecosystems\n  C: ignores the possibility that the same cause might have different effects on fish of different sizes\n  D: ignores the possibility that the overabundance of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are independent effects of a common cause\n  E: ignores the possibility that below-normal amounts of algae are detrimental to the pond's smaller fish\n\n  Answer: \"D: ignores the possibility that the overabundance of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are independent effects of a common cause\"\n\nExplanation:\nThe local resident's argument assumes that the overabundance of algae is the cause of the deaths of smaller fish, but it ignores the possibility that both the overabundance of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are independent effects of a common cause, such as changes in water temperature, pollution, or other environmental factors. This failure to consider alternative explanations for the observed correlation weakens the argument and makes it vulnerable to criticism. Therefore, option D is the best answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
