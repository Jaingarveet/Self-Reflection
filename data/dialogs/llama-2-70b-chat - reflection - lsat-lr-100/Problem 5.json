Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?\nChoices:\n  A: The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953.\n  B: The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.\n  C: The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years.\n  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.\n  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.\n\n  Answer: E\n\nThe statement E, \"Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953,\" if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described in the question.\n\nThe question states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953, but meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged. This suggests that there must be another factor contributing to the increase in recorded tornadoes.\n\nOption E provides a plausible explanation for the increase in recorded tornadoes. If many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953, then it is likely that more tornadoes are being reported and recorded now than in the past. This increased reporting could contribute to the observed increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually, even if the actual number of tornadoes occurring has not changed.\n\nNone of the other options provide a plausible explanation for the increase in recorded tornadoes. Option A is not relevant to the issue at hand, as it merely states that meteorologists did not have as much knowledge about tornadoes before 1953. Option B states that the intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953, but this does not explain why more tornadoes are being recorded. Option C states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years, which does not address the larger trend of an increase in recorded tornadoes since 1953. Option D states that the amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953, but this does not explain why more tornadoes are being recorded.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
