So, if we are to maintain the quality of the education we provide, we must market our programs more aggressively. Without such marketing we will be unable to increase our enrollment.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the university president's argument can be properly drawn ifwhich one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides ifit increases its enrollment.\n  B: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it increases its enrollment.\n  C: The university will increase its enrollmentifit markets its programs more aggressively.\n  D: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.\n  E: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it markets its programs more aggressively.\n\n  Answer: C\n\nThe university president's argument concludes that the university must market its programs more aggressively to increase enrollment and maintain the quality of education. The correct assumption is that the university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively (choice C).\n\nThe other choices do not support the conclusion:\n\n* Choice A: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would negatively impact the quality of education, which contradicts the president's argument.\n* Choice B: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but the argument only establishes a link between marketing and enrollment, not between enrollment and spending reductions.\n* Choice D: This statement suggests that reducing spending would negatively impact the quality of education, but the argument does not address the relationship between spending and quality.\n* Choice E: This statement suggests that marketing would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but, like choice B, it does not follow from the argument's premises.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
