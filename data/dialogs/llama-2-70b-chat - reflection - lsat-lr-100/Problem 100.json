        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\n\n  Answer: A\n\nThe argument states that lawmakers in certain jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, as they have mandated identical penalties for both crimes. Option A supports this argument by stating that lawmakers generally mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe results from those crimes. This means that lawmakers consider the harm resulting from theft and bribery to be equal, which strengthens the argument.\n\nOption B is irrelevant to the argument, as it only states that lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. It does not address the penalties mandated for those crimes.\n\nOption C is also irrelevant, as it only states that lawmakers may mandate increased penalties for a crime in response to unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of that crime. This does not address the general sentencing guidelines for theft and bribery.\n\nOption D is incorrect, as it states that victims of theft are harmed no more than victims of bribery are harmed. This does not address the penalties mandated for the crimes, and it could be argued that victims of bribery may suffer greater harm due to the corrupt nature of the act.\n\nOption E is incorrect, as it states that mandating penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes will effectively deter crime. While this may be true, it does not directly support the argument that lawmakers consider the harm resulting from theft and bribery to be equal.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
