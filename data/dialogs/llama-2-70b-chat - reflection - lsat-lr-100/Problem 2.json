This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nQuestion: If the above statements are true, which one of the following statements must also be true?\nChoices:\n  A: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n  B: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n  C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n  D: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\n  E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\n  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe given statements imply that there is a strong correlation between the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and those that won prizes at international film festivals.

However, the given statements only mention that the films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian, not that all Canadian films were shown at the festival.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. This statement is true, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the films that won prizes at the two types of festivals.\n\nOption E is incorrect because it states that at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
