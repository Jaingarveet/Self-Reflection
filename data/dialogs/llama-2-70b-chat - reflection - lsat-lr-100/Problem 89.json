Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In a party game, one person leaves the room with the understanding that someone else will relate a recent dream to the remaining group. The person then returns and tries to reconstruct the dream by asking only yes-or-no questions. In fact, no dream has been related: the group simply answers the questions according to some arbitrary rule. Surprisingly, the person usually constructs a dream narrative that is both coherent and ingenious.\nQuestion: The example presented above most closely conforms to which one of the following propositions?\nChoices:\n  A: The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence.\n  B: One is less apt to reach a false understanding of what someone says than to make no sense out of it at all.\n  C: Dreams are often just collections ofiruages and ideas without coherent structures.\n  D: Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative.\n  E: People often invent clever and coherent stories to explain their behavior to other people.\n\n  Answer:  A\n\nExplanation:\nThe example presented above most closely conforms to proposition A: \"The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to imbue it with order and coherence.\" The person in the game assumes that the group's answers are related to a dream, and they try to construct a coherent narrative based on the yes-or-no answers they receive. Even though there is no actual dream, the person's presumption that there is a coherent narrative leads them to create one based on the arbitrary answers given by the group. This illustrates how our tendency to look for order and meaning can sometimes lead us to create coherent narratives where none exist.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
