Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Brooks: I'm unhappy in my job, but I don't know whether I can accept the risks involved in quitting my job. Morgenstern: The only risk in quitting is that of not finding another job. If you don't find one, you're going to be pretty unhappy. But you're already unhappy, so you might as well just quit.\nQuestion: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it\nChoices:\n  A: fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance\n  B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true\n  C: mischaracterize what Brooks says\n  D: conllates two different types of risk\n  E: reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case\n\n  Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nMorgenstern's argument assumes that Brooks' unhappiness in his current job is the same level of unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. Brooks' unhappiness in his current job may be significantly greater than the unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. Therefore, Morgenstern's argument fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance, making it a flawed argument.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nMorgenstern's argument is flawed because it fails to take into account the possibility that Brooks' unhappiness in his current job may be significantly greater than the unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. Morgenstern assumes that the unhappiness Brooks would experience in both situations is equal, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, Morgenstern's argument does not adequately address the complexity of Brooks' situation, and it fails to provide a convincing reason for why Brooks should quit his job.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Oversimplification\n* Lack of nuance\n* Inadequate consideration of variables\n\nSolution:\nTo improve Morgenstern's argument, he should have acknowledged the possibility that Brooks' unhappiness in his current job may be greater than the unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. Morgenstern could have then provided additional reasons or evidence to support his conclusion that quitting is the best option for Brooks, despite the potential risks involved.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the flawed assumption in Morgenstern's argument.\n2. Consider the complexity of Brooks' situation and the potential variables at play.\n3. Provide additional reasons or evidence to support your conclusion.\n4. Avoid oversimplifying the situation and ensure that your argument takes into account the nuances of the problem.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always consider the potential complexities of a situation before making a decision.\n* Avoid relying on assumptions or oversimplifications that do not adequately address the problem at hand.\n* Provide evidence and reasons to support your conclusion, and be willing to adapt your argument based on new information or perspectives."
