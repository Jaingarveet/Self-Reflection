Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group.\nQuestion: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist\nChoices:\n  A: gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group\n  B: does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group\n  C: does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document\n  D: presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known\n  E: takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information\n\n  Answer: \"B\"\n\nThe journalist's reasoning is flawed because the journalist does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group. The document only lists hundreds of manufacturing companies, but it does not necessarily list all the members of the trade group. The journalist assumes that if Bruch Industries were a member of the trade group, it would be listed in the document, but this assumption is not necessarily true. The trade group may have other members that are not listed in the document, and therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is not justified.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
