Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In some countries, there is a free flow of information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, whereas in other countries, this information is controlled by a small elite. In the latter countries, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare. Thus, these countries are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries do.\nQuestion: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: It is more likely that people without political power will suffer from economic crises than it is that people in power will.\n  B: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases.\n  C: In nations in which the government controls access to information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, economic crises are common.\n  D: The higher the percentage of the population that participates in economic decisions, the better those decisions are.\n  E: A small elite that controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is likely to manipulate that information for its own benefit.\n\n  Answer: \nThe conclusion follows logically if choice B is assumed: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases. If the population lacks access to vital information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, they will be less able to make informed decisions about their economic activities, which can lead to economic crises. This answer choice aligns with the context, which states that the lack of information available to the vast majority of the population in certain countries can lead to more frequent economic crises.\n\nThe other answer choices do not logically lead to the conclusion. Choice A states that people without political power are more likely to suffer from economic crises, but this does not necessarily relate to the availability of information. Choice C mentions that economic crises are common in nations where the government controls access to information, but this does not imply a causal relationship between the two. Choice D suggests that higher participation in economic decisions leads to better decisions, but this is unrelated to the availability of information. Choice E suggests that the elite may manipulate information for their own benefit, but this does not necessarily result in economic crises.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
