Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Retailers that excel in neither convenience nor variety of merchandise tend not to be very successful. Yet many successful retailers excel in just one of the areas and meet competitors' standards for the other. Hence, a retailer's success need not depend on excellence in both areas.\nQuestion: The structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary.\n  B: Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed.\n  C: Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes. Therefore, anyone who does excel at all the strokes is almost certain to win.\n  D: Apples that are neither especially firm nor especially flavorful are unsuitable for baking; yet while flavor is essential for both baking and eating, many flavorful apples that are soft are suitable for eating. Hence, the apples that are best for eating need not be both firm and flavorful.\n  E: Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds. Hence, not all inedible and non-ornamental plants are weeds.\n\n  Answer: The structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in choice A: Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary.\n\nExplanation:\nBoth the argument and choice A present a similar pattern of reasoning. They assert that success in a particular field does not require excellence in all aspects, citing examples of individuals who have succeeded despite only excelling in one area. They also imply that meeting certain standards in one area can compensate for average performance in another.\n\nIn the argument, success in retail does not require excellence in both convenience and variety of merchandise, as some successful retailers excel in only one of these areas. Similarly, in choice A, success in long-distance races does not require above-average speed and endurance, as some champions win by excelling in only one of these aspects.\n\nThe other choices do not present the same parallel structure:\n\nB: This choice presents a different scenario, where success in a long-distance race can be achieved by excelling in either speed or endurance, but not necessarily both. However, it does not address the idea that average performance in one area can be compensated by excellence in another.\n\nC: This choice presents a scenario where excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not necessary to win a race, but it does not provide an example of individuals who succeed despite only excelling in one area.\n\nD: This choice presents a scenario where apples that are neither firm nor flavorful are unsuitable for baking, but it does not provide an example of individuals who succeed despite only excelling in one area.\n\nE: This choice presents a scenario where some plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are still useful, but it does not provide an example of individuals who succeed despite only excelling in one area.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
