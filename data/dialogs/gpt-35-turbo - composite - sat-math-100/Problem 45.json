There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?\nChoices:\n  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$\n  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$\n  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$\n  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly identified that the function is linear and used the slope-intercept form, but I made an error in calculating the y-intercept. \nThe y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is not given in the table. \nTherefore, I should have used the given data to find the slope and then used the slope and any point in the table to find the y-intercept. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Slope-intercept form error\n - Y-intercept error\nSolution:\nThe slope is the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight, which is $\\frac{\\$ 21.89-\\$ 16.94}{10-5}=\\$ 0.99$.\nUsing the point $(5, \\$ 16.94)$, we can find the y-intercept as follows:\n$16.94=0.99(5)+b$\n$b=11.99$\nTherefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given data in the problem.\n2. Determine the type of function that relates the given data.\n3. Use the slope-intercept form to write the function.\n4. Identify the slope of the function using the given data.\n5. Use any point in the table to find the y-intercept.\n6. Write the final function.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept of a linear function.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the slope of a linear function is the change in y divided by the change in x.\n - Remember that the y-intercept of a linear function is the y-value when x is 0.\n"
