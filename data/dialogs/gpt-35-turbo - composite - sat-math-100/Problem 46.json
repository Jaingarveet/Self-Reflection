The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?\nChoices:\n  A: Mean\n  B: Median\n  C: Range\n  D: They will all change by the same amount.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly chose the mean as the answer. The range will change the most if the outlier measurement of 24 inches is removed from the data. \nThe gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the definitions of mean, median, and range, but in understanding the impact of outliers on these measures of central tendency. \nI knew the definitions of mean, median, and range, but did not consider the impact of outliers on these measures.\nError Keywords:\n - Outlier error\n - Impact of outliers\n - Misunderstanding of measures of central tendency\nSolution:\nThe outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error.\nIf the outlier is removed, the range will change the most because it is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.\nThe smallest value is 8 inches and the largest value is 16 inches.\nThe range is 16 - 8 = 8 inches.\nIf the outlier is removed, the largest value is 15 inches.\nThe range is 15 - 8 = 7 inches.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the measures of central tendency: mean, median, and range.\n2. Identify the outlier in the data set.\n3. Consider the impact of the outlier on each measure of central tendency.\n4. Remove the outlier from the data set.\n5. Recalculate the mean, median, and range.\n6. Determine which measure of central tendency changes the most.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the impact of outliers on measures of central tendency.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.\n - Remember that the mean is the average of the data set.\n - Remember that the median is the middle value of the data set.\n"
