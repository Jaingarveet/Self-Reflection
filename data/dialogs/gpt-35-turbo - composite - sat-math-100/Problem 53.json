Which of the following points lies on the line?\nChoices:\n  A: $(0,7)$\n  B: $(1,7)$\n  C: $(7,7)$\n  D: $(14,2)$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI used the equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\\frac{1}{7}$ correctly. However, I made a calculation error while substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line. \nThe point [REDACTED] does not lie on the line $y=\\frac{1}{7}x$.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Substitution error\n - Algebraic manipulation error\nSolution:\nThe equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\\frac{1}{7}$ is $y=\\frac{1}{7}x$.\nLet's check which point lies on this line by substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line.\nFor point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\\frac{1}{7}x=0$, which is not true.\nFor point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\\frac{1}{7}x=\\frac{1}{7}$, which is not true.\nFor point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\\frac{1}{7}x=1$, which is not true.\nFor point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\\frac{1}{7}x=2$, which is true.\nTherefore, the point [REDACTED] lies on the line $y=\\frac{1}{7}x$.\nInstructions:\n1. Write down the equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $m$.\n2. Substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line for each point.\n3. Simplify the equation and check if it is true.\n4. Choose the point that satisfies the equation of the line.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula or equation to solve the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that substitution is a powerful tool to check if a point lies on a line or curve.\n"
