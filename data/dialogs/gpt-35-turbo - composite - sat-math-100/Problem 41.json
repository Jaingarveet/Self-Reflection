Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $x-2$\n  B: $x-3$\n  C: $x-4$\n  D: $x-5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI used the Factor Theorem correctly but made an error in my calculations. \nI checked which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$ but made a mistake in the calculation for choice [REDACTED]. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Algebraic error\n - Substitution error\nSolution:\nWe can use the Factor Theorem to determine which of the choices is a factor of $f(x)$.\nIf $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(a)=0$.\nWe can check which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$.\nFor choice [REDACTED], $f(2)=1$, so [REDACTED] is not a factor of $f(x)$.\nFor choice [REDACTED], $f(3)$ is not given, so we cannot determine if [REDACTED] is a factor of $f(x)$.\nFor choice [REDACTED], $f(4)=0$, so [REDACTED] is a factor of $f(x)$.\nFor choice [REDACTED], $f(5)=-2$, so [REDACTED] is not a factor of $f(x)$.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } x-4}$.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the Factor Theorem and how it applies to polynomial functions.\n2. Identify the given values of $x$ and $f(x)$ in the table.\n3. For each choice, substitute the given value of $x$ into the expression $x-a$.\n4. Evaluate $f(a)$ using the given value of $a$.\n5. If $f(a)=0$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$.\n6. Choose the answer that makes $f(a)=0$.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the given information to your advantage.\n - Always check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the Factor Theorem can help you determine factors of polynomial functions.\n"
