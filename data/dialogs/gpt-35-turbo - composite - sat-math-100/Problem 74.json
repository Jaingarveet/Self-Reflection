Simplify the expression inside the parentheses using the common denominator.\n2. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the common denominator of the fraction.\n3. Expand the numerator.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always simplify expressions using the common denominator.\n - Always double-check your algebraic manipulations.\n - Remember that multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same expression does not change the value of the fraction.\n"
