If 30 states joined the United States between 1776 and 1849 and $x$ states joined between 1850 and 1900 , which of the following equations is true?\nChoices:\n  A: $30 x=2$\n  B: $2 x=30$\n  C: $\\frac{x}{2}=30$\n  D: $x+30=2$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in calculating the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900. \nThe correct number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900 is $2 \\times 30 = 60$, not 15. \nTherefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Division error\n - Misinterpretation of the problem\nSolution:\nLet $y$ be the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.\nWe know that $30+x=2y$ and $y=2(30-x)$.\nSimplifying the second equation, we get $y=60-2x$.\nEquating the two expressions for $y$, we get $60-2x=30+x$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=30$.\nTherefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the variables and equations involved.\n3. Solve for the unknown variable using the given equations.\n4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the variables and equations involved.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that solving equations involves isolating the unknown variable on one side of the equation.\n"
