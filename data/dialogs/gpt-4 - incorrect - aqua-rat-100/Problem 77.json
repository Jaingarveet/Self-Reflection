        "content": "Thought: \nConsecutive odd numbers have a difference of 2 between each number. If we take the middle number as x, the five numbers will be x-4, x-2, x, x+2, x+4. The sum of these numbers is 5x. This sum divided by 10 should be a perfect square, so 5x/10 = x/2 should be a perfect square. This means x should be an even number. Among the choices, only 44 is an even number. But 44 is not an odd number, so it can't be the answer. So, we need to check each option one by one.\nLet's start with option A: 47. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 43, 45, 47, 49, 51. Their sum is 235, which divided by 10 is 23.5, not a perfect square.\nOption B: 91. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 87, 89, 91, 93, 95. Their sum is 455, which divided by 10 is 45.5, not a perfect square.\nOption C: 41. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 37, 39, 41, 43, 45. Their sum is 205, which divided by 10 is 20.5, not a perfect square.\nOption D: 67. The five consecutive odd numbers would be 63, 65, 67, 69, 71. Their sum is 335, which divided by 10 is 33.5, not a perfect square.\nNone of the options form a perfect square when the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers is divided by 10. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the options provided.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
