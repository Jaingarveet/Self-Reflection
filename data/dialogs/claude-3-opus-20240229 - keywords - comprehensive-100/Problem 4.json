        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed. \n2. To find the speed, we use the formula: speed = distance / time\n   speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s\n3. Now, we know it takes the shuttle 5 seconds to pass a point. This 5 seconds is the time it takes the shuttle to travel its own length at the maximum speed.\n4. Using the speed we calculated and the time to pass a point, we can find the length:\n   length = speed * time \n          = 17.5 m/s * 5s\n          = 87.5 m\n5. The closest answer choice to 87.5 m is 75 m.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
