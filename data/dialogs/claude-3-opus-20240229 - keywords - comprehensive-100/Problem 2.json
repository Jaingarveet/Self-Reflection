        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) There are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. So the total width of all the pickets is x/2 inches.\n2) There are x-1 spaces between the pickets (this is a key insight - there is one less space than the number of pickets). Each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is 6(x-1) inches.\n3) The total length of the fence is the sum of the width of the pickets and the width of the spaces:\n   Total length = x/2 + 6(x-1) inches\n4) Simplify:\n   x/2 + 6(x-1) = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 13x/2 - 6 inches\n5) Convert to feet by dividing by 12:\n   (13x/2 - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24 feet\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
