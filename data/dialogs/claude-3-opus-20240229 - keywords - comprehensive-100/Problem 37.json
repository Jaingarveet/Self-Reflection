Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of key information\n - Overlooking directly stated facts\n - Overemphasis on tangential points\n - Insufficient re-evaluation of all answer choices\n"

Let me carefully re-evaluate the question and answer choices.\nThe key points from the passage are:\n1) Cat allergies are caused by specific proteins in cat skin secretions and saliva\n2) The particular proteins people are allergic to varies from person to person \n3) All cats shed skin and spread saliva, so there are no completely non-allergenic cats\n4) However, a given cat may cause allergies in some cat-allergic people but not others\nLooking at the answer choices again:\nA: This is not supported. The passage indicates allergies depend on proteins, not cat breeds.\nB: This is strongly supported. Since people are allergic to different proteins, no single cat will necessarily cause allergies in all cat-allergic people.\nC: While possibly true, this is not directly stated or strongly supported by the information given.\nD: The passage does not discuss or compare the intensity of allergic reactions.\nE: This is contradicted by the statement that a cat may cause allergies in some allergic people but not others. So allergic reactions to a specific cat can vary predictably by person.\nUpon re-evaluation, B is clearly the best supported answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
