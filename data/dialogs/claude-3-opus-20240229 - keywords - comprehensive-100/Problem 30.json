K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

        "content": "You're right, upon further reflection I see that my previous answer was incorrect. Let me think through this step-by-step:\n1. There are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. \n2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf.\n3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n4. I is on the middle shelf.\n5. K is on a higher shelf than F. \n6. O is on a higher shelf than L.\n7. F and M are on the same shelf.\n8. The question states G is on the top shelf.\nWith G on the top shelf, there are 7 books left to distribute. I must be on the middle shelf per the conditions.\nF and M must be together, and K must be higher than them. Since more books are on the bottom than top, F and M must be on the bottom, and K must be middle or top. But with G already on top, K must be on the middle shelf.\nSo the middle shelf must contain I and K so far. O must be higher than L, so L is on the bottom. H is the only unplaced book, and could be on any shelf.\nLooking at the answer choices, the only one that fits is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nI, K and L must be the books on the middle shelf. My previous error was not fully considering the implications of each condition and prematurely eliminating valid possibilities."
