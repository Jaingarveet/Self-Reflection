This seems likely.\nB) Shaking his head and smiling is an overanalysis of facial expressions that isn't clearly warranted. Less likely.\nC) Writing on a napkin for two minutes is an odd action unrelated to drumming. Unlikely.\nD) Playing so hard his fingers bleed is an extreme unwarranted reaction.
