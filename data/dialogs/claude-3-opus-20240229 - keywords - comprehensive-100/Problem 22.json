Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Incomplete analysis of constraints\n - Prematurely eliminating valid scenarios\n - Incorrect deduction\n"

Let me think through this again more carefully:\nThe key constraints are:\n- George can only report on Tuesday\n- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports\n- If Nina reports, Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday\nIf George, Nina and Robert report on different days:\n- George must report on Tuesday (only day he can)\n- Nina cannot report on Tuesday (as that would require Helen and Irving to report on Wednesday, and there are only 2 slots per day)\n- Robert cannot report on Tuesday afternoon\nChecking the answer choices one by one:\nA) Helen reports Wednesday. This is possible if Nina reports Monday, requiring Helen and Irving to report Tuesday. \nB) Nina reports Monday. This works, as discussed in (A).\nC) Nina reports Tuesday. This is not possible as explained above.\nD) Olivia reports Monday. This is possible and does not violate any constraints.\nE) Robert reports Wednesday. This is possible and does not violate any constraints.\nTherefore, (A), (B), (D) and (E) could all be true. (C) is the only one that is not possible.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
