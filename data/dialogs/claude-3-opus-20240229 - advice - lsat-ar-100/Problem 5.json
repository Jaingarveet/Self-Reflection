At least 2 books are on each shelf.\n3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n4. I is on the middle shelf. \n5. K is on a higher shelf than F.\n6. O is on a higher shelf than L.\n7. F and M are on the same shelf.\nNow, let's consider each answer choice:\nA) We don't know the relative positions of O and M. Insufficient information to conclude this.\nB) We don't know the relative positions of K and G. Insufficient information to conclude this.\nC) We know I is on the middle shelf. F and M are on the same shelf, which must be the bottom shelf (as there are more books on the bottom than top, and K is higher than F). So I is definitely higher than F.\nD) We don't know the relative positions of G and O. Insufficient information to conclude this.\nE) We know O is higher than L, but we don't know if F is higher or lower than L. Insufficient information to conclude this.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
