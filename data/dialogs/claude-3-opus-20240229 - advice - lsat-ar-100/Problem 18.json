Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?\nChoices:\n  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle\n  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\n  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem statement and answer choices carefully.\n - Always list out all the given conditions and constraints explicitly.\n - Always consider each constraint for each answer choice; don't skip any.\n - Never make assumptions; only use the information given in the problem.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and selected answer against the conditions.\n - If the problem involves scheduling or sequencing, consider using a diagram or table to organize the information and constraints.\n"

Nina reports Wednesday morning, so condition 3 doesn't apply. And conditions 1 and 2 are met.\nC: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen\n    Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle\n    Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\nThis violates condition 2, as Robert reports on a morning (Wednesday).\nD: [REDACTED]\nThis violates condition 3. Nina reports Monday, so Helen and Irving must report Tuesday, but they report on Tuesday and Wednesday instead.\nE: [REDACTED]\nThis violates condition 1, as George reports on a Wednesday afternoon instead of a Tuesday.\nAfter careful analysis, the only schedule that meets all the conditions is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
