Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question and conditions carefully, and make sure you understand them fully before attempting to solve the problem.\n - Be careful not to make any unsupported assumptions. Only use the information that is explicitly given.\n - Consider all possibilities that satisfy the given conditions. Don't stop at the first scenario you find.\n - When trying to minimize or maximize a quantity, consider extreme scenarios that push the boundaries of the conditions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and make sure your answer satisfies all the given conditions.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This is a fixed condition.\n2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. The third solo is traditional, so either the 2nd and 3rd, or the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces. \n3. In the 4th solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the 3rd and 4th solos are the consecutive traditional pieces, then Wayne must perform the 4th solo (since the 2nd and 5th solos can't be by the same pianist).\n4. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the 1st or 2nd solo.\nConsidering these conditions, here is a scenario that minimizes the number of traditional pieces performed by Wayne:\n1st solo: Wayne performs a modern piece\n2nd solo: Zara performs a modern piece \n3rd solo: Zara performs a traditional piece\n4th solo: Zara performs a traditional piece\n5th solo: Wayne performs a modern piece\nIn this scenario, Wayne performs zero traditional pieces, which is the minimum possible given the conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
