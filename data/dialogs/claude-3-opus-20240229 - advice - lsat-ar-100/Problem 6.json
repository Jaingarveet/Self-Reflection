The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the big picture and total quantities involved, not just specific details.\n - Look for implied information and necessary conclusions, not just explicitly stated facts.\n - Eliminate answer choices methodically based on your deductions.\n - If an answer choice contains an absolute statement (e.g., \"must be true\"), look for any possible counterexample that disproves it.\n - Reread the question and answers carefully to ensure you are selecting an answer that is definitely true, not just possibly true.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian reviews the most plays.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the plays Jiang reviews are different from those reviewed by Lopez and Megregian. \n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So they review at least one play in common.\n4. Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s) as each other. Given #3, this must be Kramer and O'Neill. No other pair can review the exact same set of plays.\n5. Since Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian (#1), and Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays (#4), O'Neill must also review fewer plays than Megregian.\nTherefore, the answer that must be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\nMegregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does. We deduced this from the given information.\nThe other choices are not definitely true:\nA: We don't know how many plays Jiang or Lopez review relative to each other. \nB, D: Jiang's plays are different from Megregian's and O'Neill's, but the quantity is unknown.\nE: Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays.\nSo C is the only statement that must be true based on the information provided. The key was recognizing the implications of Kramer and O'Neill reviewing the same plays, and Megregian reviewing the most overall."
