Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully read and identify all scheduling conditions and restrictions.\n - Always consider conditional restrictions and how one person's scheduled slot impacts others.\n - Work through the schedule systematically, filling in the most restricted slots first.\n - Continually check the evolving schedule against the conditions to ensure validity.\n - If a condition is violated, backtrack and revise the schedule until all conditions are met.\n - Double-check the final schedule against all conditions before finalizing your answer.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, taking into account the scheduling conditions and restrictions:\n1. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must report on Tuesday, either morning or afternoon.\n2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they report, it must be in the morning. \n3. If Nina reports, then the next day both Helen and Irving must report (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). \n4. Kyle and Lenore are not reporting.\n5. There must be exactly 2 reports per day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon.\nLet's start filling in the schedule, being mindful of the restrictions:\n- Tuesday morning must be George. That's the only slot he can take.\n- Monday morning could be Olivia or Robert since they can only do mornings. Let's tentatively put Robert on Monday morning.\n- If Nina reports Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must report on a non-existent Thursday. So Nina cannot report Wednesday. She must report Monday or Tuesday.\n- If Nina reports Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must report Tuesday. But George has to report Tuesday. So Nina cannot report Monday. \n- Nina must report Tuesday afternoon. That puts Helen and Irving on Wednesday.\nChecking the final schedule:\nMonday morning: Robert\nMonday afternoon: [someone]\nTuesday morning: George \nTuesday afternoon: Nina\nWednesday morning: Helen\nWednesday afternoon: Irving\nThis matches choice E: Robert, George, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
