At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Don't make unwarranted assumptions. Consider all possibilities that fit the conditions.\n - Use the process of elimination, but be careful not to prematurely eliminate correct answers.\n - Make deductions step-by-step based on the given conditions.\n - If a condition specifies a relative placement (e.g., higher, lower, same), use that information to place books on specific shelves.\n - Double-check that your final answer satisfies all the given conditions.\n"

More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n4. I is on the middle shelf.\n5. K is on a higher shelf than F.\n6. O is on a higher shelf than L.\n7. F is on the same shelf as M.\nFrom conditions 5 and 7, we know F and M must be together on either the middle or bottom shelf (since K is higher than F).\nFrom condition 4, I is on the middle shelf. So F and M cannot be on the middle shelf with I. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.\nCondition 3 says there are more books on the bottom than the top. With F and M already on the bottom, there must be at least 3 books there to have more than the top (which has at least 2). \nLooking at the answer choices, only B and D have F and M on the bottom shelf with at least 3 books total. \nBetween B and D, only D has more than 3 books on the bottom, satisfying the condition of having more books on the bottom than the top.\nTherefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of the books on the bottom shelf is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
