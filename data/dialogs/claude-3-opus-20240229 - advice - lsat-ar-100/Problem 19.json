Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question and conditions carefully, and make sure you understand them fully before attempting to solve the problem.\n - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts and tackle them one by one.\n - Use the process of elimination to rule out impossible scenarios and narrow down the possibilities.\n - Pay attention to the logical connections between the different conditions and how they impact each other.\n - Double-check your reasoning at each step to avoid making faulty inferences or deductions.\n - If you get stuck, try working backwards from the given information or considering different scenarios systematically.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports. This means the other five students (George, Irving, Nina, Olivia, Robert) must give the three afternoon reports.\n2. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must give the Tuesday afternoon report. \n3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So the Monday and Wednesday afternoon reports must be given by either Irving or Nina.\n4. If Nina gives a report, then the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports (unless Nina reports on Wednesday). \n   - Nina can't report Monday (because then Helen and Irving would have to report Tuesday, but George must report Tuesday afternoon)\n   - Nina can't report Tuesday (because then Helen and Irving would have to report Wednesday, but they are giving morning reports)\n   - So Nina must report Wednesday afternoon, if at all\n5. This leaves Irving to give the Monday afternoon report.\nTherefore, if Helen, Kyle and Lenore give the morning reports, Irving must give a report on Monday (afternoon).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
