Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always consider all the constraints given in the question.\n - Think through the logical implications of each piece of information.\n - Be sure to consider how different pieces of information interact.\n - Don't just focus on the obvious or explicit information; consider implicit implications as well.\n - When a specific scenario is given, think through what it would mean and what it would require.\n - Eliminate answer choices methodically based on the given information.\n - The correct answer in a \"could be false\" question will be the choice that is not necessarily true given the information.\n"

At least one batch is made on Monday.\n3. The 2nd oatmeal batch is made the same day as the 1st peanut butter batch.\n4. The 2nd sugar batch is made on Thursday.\n5. One cookie's 1st batch is made the same day as another's 3rd batch.\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA: This doesn't have to be true. The information doesn't require a batch to be made every day.\nB: Wednesday isn't specifically mentioned, so we can't be sure two batches are made that day. \nC: We're told at least one batch is made Monday, but it could be more than one.\nD: Tuesday isn't mentioned, so we can't be certain exactly two batches are made that day.\nE: Since the 2nd sugar batch is Thursday, the 3rd has to be Friday. No other 3rd batches can be Friday (by constraint 1). But the 1st batch of another cookie is made the same day as some 3rd batch (by 5). So there must be a 1st batch on Friday too. Therefore, it can't be true that exactly one batch is made Friday.\nE is the only one that must be false given the information. The others could potentially be true.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
