This satisfies the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.\n2. Since there must be at least two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, R must be performed either second or eighth. \n3. O must be performed either first or fifth, but since T is fifth, O must be first.\n4. The eighth composition is either L or H. Since R can't be eighth (because there needs to be two compositions between F and R), the eighth must be L or H.\n5. P must be performed before S. And there must be at least one composition either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n6. If R is second, then the order so far is: O _ R _ T F _ _\n   The remaining slots are 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th. \n   P and S must be 3rd and 4th in some order to satisfy the conditions. \n   So S must be either 3rd or 4th.\n7. If R is eighth, then the order so far is: O _ _ _ T F _ R\n   The remaining slots are 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th.\n   P and S must be 2nd and 7th in some order to satisfy the conditions.\n   So S must be either 2nd or 7th.\nTherefore, S must be performed either second or seventh.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
