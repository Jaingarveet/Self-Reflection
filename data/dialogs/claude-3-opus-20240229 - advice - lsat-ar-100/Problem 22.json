Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question states that both G and H are selected. Since G and H are both botanists, this means the panel includes more than one botanist.\n2. One of the conditions states: \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\" \n   So with G and H on the panel, there can be at most one zoologist.\n3. Another condition states: \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\" \n   But P and R are both zoologists. If they were both selected, that would violate the condition from step 2 (at most one zoologist if more than one botanist).\n   \n4. Therefore, chemist M cannot be selected, because that would force the selection of both P and R, which is not allowed in this scenario.\n5. So one of the chemists K or L must be selected instead to satisfy the condition of having at least one of each type of scientist.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\nThe panel must include either chemist K or chemist L. Chemist M is ruled out by the conditions and constraints given."
