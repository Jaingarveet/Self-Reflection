At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.\n3. O is performed either first or fifth. \n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n5. P is performed at some time before S. \n6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nWe're also told that P is 3rd and S is 6th. \nFrom condition 3, since P is 3rd, O must be 5th (it can only be 1st or 5th).\nCondition 6 is satisfied since there is one composition (P) after O and before S.\nCondition 5 is satisfied since P (3rd) is before S (6th).\nCondition 4 means either L or H is 8th. This leaves the other one to be either 2nd, 4th or 7th.\nFrom 1 and 2, we can deduce that either:\n- F is 1st, R is 4th, and T is 5th, or \n- R is 5th, F is 8th, and T is 4th or 7th\nBut we know O is 5th, so the first scenario is impossible. \nTherefore, R must be 5th, F must be 8th, and T must be 4th or 7th.\nIn summary:\n1. ?\n2.
