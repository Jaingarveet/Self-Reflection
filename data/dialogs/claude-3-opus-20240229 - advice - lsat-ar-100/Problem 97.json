Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\n  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\n  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\n  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and note all given constraints and fixed events.\n - Consider the logical implications of each piece of information on the other variables.\n - Eliminate possibilities that directly violate the stated constraints.\n - Analyze each answer choice individually rather than assuming one must be correct.\n - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that lead to constraint violations.\n - If stuck, try working through the scheduling possibilities day by day.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This means the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.\n2. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. No two batches of the same cookie are made on the same day, so the other sugar cookie batches must be on Monday, Wednesday or Friday. \n3. At least one batch is made on Monday. It can't be sugar cookies or peanut butter cookies, so it must be a batch of oatmeal cookies. Let's say it's the first batch of oatmeal.\n4. Now let's look at each answer choice:\nA) This could be true. The first oatmeal and first sugar could both be Monday.\nB) This is impossible. We know peanut butter and oatmeal both have their first batch Tuesday, so there can't be two first batches that day.\nC) This could be true. The second peanut butter and second sugar could both be Wednesday. \nD) This can't be true. The second sugar batch is fixed on Thursday. No other second batch can be that day.\nE) This could be true. The third oatmeal and third peanut butter could both be Friday.\nTherefore, the answer choice that cannot be true is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
