Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?\nChoices:\n  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia\n  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca\n  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa\n  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan\n  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read each constraint multiple times to ensure full understanding. \n - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that add restrictions beyond those stated.\n - Eliminate answer choices one constraint at a time to organize your reasoning.\n - For constraints with relative terms, consider alternate interpretations beyond the strictest one.\n - Don't stop evaluating an answer choice just because it satisfies most constraints; it must satisfy all.\n - If you eliminate an answer choice, don't second-guess yourself without strong justification.\n"

Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choices A and D.\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Both remaining choices (B and C) satisfy this.\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day than Olivia's. \n   - In B, Julio is on Thursday and Olivia on Wednesday, so this is not satisfied. \n   - But in C, Julio is on Thursday and Olivia on Friday. So C satisfies this constraint.\nTherefore, by process of elimination, C is the only remaining choice that satisfies all the constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
