At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Carefully read and understand all the given conditions before starting to place books.\n - Break down the problem into smaller steps, placing books one at a time based on the given conditions.\n - Use the process of elimination to determine the positions of books that are not explicitly mentioned in the conditions.\n - Always double-check your final arrangement to ensure it satisfies all the given conditions.\n - Be flexible in your thinking and ready to adjust your reasoning if a contradiction arises.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\n2. I is on the middle shelf. \n3. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So K must be on the top shelf, while F and M are together on either the middle or bottom shelf.\n4. O is on a higher shelf than L. \n5. The key condition: L is on a higher shelf than H. \n   This means the order from top to bottom is: K, O, L, H (not necessarily next to each other).\n6. Since I is on the middle shelf, and K is on the top shelf, O must also be on the top shelf with K.\n7. L and H must be on the bottom shelf, since L is above H but below O.\n8. F and M must be on the middle shelf with I, since they can't be with K on top or with L and H on bottom.\n9. This leaves only G, which must go on the bottom shelf to have at least 3 books there.\nSo the arrangement is:\n- Top: K, O  \n- Middle: I, F, M\n- Bottom: L, H, G\nTherefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf (bottom).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
