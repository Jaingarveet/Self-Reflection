Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always consider all possibilities consistent with the given constraints.\n- Be careful not to make unsupported assumptions or jump to conclusions.\n- Eliminate answer choices that are impossible or inconsistent with the constraints.\n- Remember that \"could be true\" means possible under some scenario, not necessarily true in all scenarios.\n- If multiple possibilities remain, look for the answer choice that holds under at least one of them.\n"

Either Parra or Tiao (not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. \n4. We're told Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone. Let's consider the possibilities:\nPossibility 1: Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1\n- This would mean Parra and Quinn are also in Zone 1 (4 reps)\n- Udall must be in Zone 2 with Tiao\n- Kim is the only rep left for Zone 3\nThis violates the condition of more reps in Zone 3 than 2. So this is impossible.\nPossibility 2: Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 2 \n- Udall is also in Zone 2 (3 reps)\n- Tiao must be in Zone 1 with either Parra or Quinn\n- The other of Parra/Quinn plus Kim are in Zone 3 (2 reps)\nThis is consistent with all the conditions. Under this scenario, Tiao works in Zone 1.\nPossibility 3: Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3\n- Udall is also in Zone 3 \n- Parra and Quinn are either in Zone 1 or 3\n- Tiao is in whichever of Zone 1 or 2 that Parra/Quinn are not\n- Kim is also in Zone 3\nThis is consistent as long as Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1, putting 4 reps in Zone 3.\nLooking at the answer choices, only E is possible under any of these scenarios (Possibility 2).\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
