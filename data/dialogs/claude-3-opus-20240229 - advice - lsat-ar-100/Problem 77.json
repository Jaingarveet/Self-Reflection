Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the constraints and rules carefully.\n - Consider the implications of each rule - how it affects the possibilities for each individual.\n - Recognize that constraints on one individual can lead to further constraints on others.\n - Be thorough in working through the implications of each rule until no further inferences can be made.\n - Organize your final results clearly before answering the question.\n - Double-check your work if time allows.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson's assignment is limited to one of four possible spaces.\n2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be in #1-4, this means Young must be in #1, #2, or #3. So Young's assignment is limited to one of three possible spaces. \n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be in #1-3, this means Togowa must be in #1 or #2. Togowa's assignment is limited to one of two possible spaces.\n4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't directly limit either to a specific number of spaces yet. \n5. We haven't determined any limitations on Souza or Xu beyond their relative positions.\nIn summary:\n- Robertson: limited to 4 possible spaces\n- Young: limited to 3 possible spaces \n- Togowa: limited to 2 possible spaces\n- Souza: no specific limitation determined\n- Xu: no specific limitation determined\n- Vaughn: no limitations mentioned\nTherefore, only one employee, Togowa, is limited to one of two possible parking spaces based on the given rules.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
