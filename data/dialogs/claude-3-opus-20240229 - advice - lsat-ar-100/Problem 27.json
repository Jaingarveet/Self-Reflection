The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully read and consider all conditions and constraints given in the question.\n - Break down complex conditions into individual requirements and analyze each one separately.\n - Use process of elimination to rule out definitively incorrect answer choices.\n - Consider each remaining answer choice individually and test it against all given conditions.\n - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that add constraints beyond those explicitly given.\n - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which one(s) could satisfy the conditions.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This eliminates choices A and E.\n2. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means Megregian must review at least 2 plays. \n3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can. This eliminates choice C.\n4. Exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other. We know Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. For this condition to hold, Megregian cannot also review Tamerlane. This eliminates choice D.\n5. The only remaining choice is B: Kramer and O'Neill. This satisfies all the conditions:\n   - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane \n   - Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian\n   - Megregian does not review Tamerlane\n   - Exactly two students (Kramer and O'Neill) review the same play (Tamerlane)\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
