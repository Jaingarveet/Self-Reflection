The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.\n3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. \n4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n5. We're told the optometrist is next to the shoe store. Let's call this pair OS.\nNow, what businesses could be on either side of the OS pair to satisfy the constraints?\n- It can't be the two restaurants, as they need at least two businesses between them.\n- The pharmacy must be at one end, so it could be on one side of OS. \n- If the pharmacy is on one side, the other side can't be the veterinarian (as the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian). \n- The other side also can't be the toy store, as that would put the veterinarian next to the toy store.\nSo if the pharmacy is on one side of OS, the other side must be a restaurant. This satisfies all the constraints.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
