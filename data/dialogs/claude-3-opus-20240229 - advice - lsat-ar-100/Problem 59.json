At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S.

At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. \n3. O is performed either first or fifth.\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n5. P is performed at some time before S.\n6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nNow, let's break it down:\n- If O is first, then S must be after the fifth position (due to condition 6). \n- P must be before S (condition 5).\n- The eighth composition is L or H (condition 4).\n- T must be next to either F or R (condition 1).\n- There must be at least two compositions between F and R (condition 2).\nConsidering all this, P cannot be seventh because:\n- If P is seventh, S must be eighth. \n- But the eighth composition must be L or H.\n- So P cannot be seventh.\nP also cannot be sixth, because:\n- If P is sixth and S is seventh, the eighth composition would have to be L or H.\n- But there would be no room to satisfy the condition of having at least two compositions between F and R.\nTherefore, the two positions that P cannot occupy are sixth and seventh.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
