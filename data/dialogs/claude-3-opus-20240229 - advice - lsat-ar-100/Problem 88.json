        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe given information is:\n- 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) on 3 shelves \n- At least 2 books per shelf\n- More books on bottom shelf than top shelf\n- I is on the middle shelf\n- K is on a higher shelf than F\n- O is on a higher shelf than L\n- F and M are on the same shelf\nSince I is on the middle shelf, that leaves 7 books to arrange on the top and bottom shelves. \nMore books must be on the bottom than top. So the only possible arrangements are:\n2 books on top, 5 on bottom\n3 books on top, 4 on bottom\nF and M must be together. K must be higher than F. O must be higher than L.\nLet's consider each choice:\nA) If I and M are on the same (middle) shelf, then F is also middle. But then we can't determine if K and O are top or bottom. Eliminates A.\nB) If K and G are on the same shelf, they could be either top or middle (above F). Can't fully determine. Eliminates B.\nC) If L and F are on the same (bottom) shelf, then M is also bottom. K and O must be higher, so middle or top. Still can't fully determine. Eliminates C.\nD) If M and H are on the same shelf as F (bottom), then L is also bottom. That's 5 books bottom. O and K must be middle and top in some order, with G on the remaining shelf. This fully determines the arrangement! \nE) If H and O are on the same shelf, they could be either middle or top. Can't fully determine. Eliminates E.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. If M and H are on the same shelf as F, the shelves for all books are fully determined.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
