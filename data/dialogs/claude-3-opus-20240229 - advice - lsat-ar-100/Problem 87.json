The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.

The organizer must select at least 5 works total. \n2. No more than 4 French works can be selected. This means at least 1 Russian work must be selected.\n3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. If only 3 novels are selected, both plays must be selected to reach the minimum of 5 works total.\n4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. This means the number of French novels is ≥ the number of Russian novels.\n5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. \nLooking at the answer choices:\nA) One French novel and one French play are not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel and the Russian play are chosen.\nB) The Russian play is not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels are chosen. \nC) One Russian novel and one French play are not necessarily selected together, e.g. if 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels are chosen.\nD) Two French novels must be selected. If only 1 French novel was selected, then 0 Russian novels could be selected (violating constraint 4), meaning ≤2 novels total (violating constraint 3).\nE) Two Russian novels are not necessarily selected, e.g. if 3 French novels, 1 Russian novel and 1 French play are chosen.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is D) Two French novels.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
