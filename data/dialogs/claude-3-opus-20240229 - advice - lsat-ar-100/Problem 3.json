Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question fully and carefully.\n - Always note and consider all given information; don't ignore key facts.\n - Always work through the logic step-by-step, considering each constraint in turn.\n - Always make definite assignments when the given information allows it.\n - Never make unsupported assumptions; only determine what can be known for certain.\n - If the question cannot be fully answered, determine what can be partially answered.\n - Always double-check your reasoning before selecting your final answer.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This satisfies the constraint that Robertson must be assigned space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n2. Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa. And Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. \n   So the order from lowest to highest must be: Togowa, Young, Robertson\n   Since Robertson is in space #3, Young must be in #1 or #2, and Togowa must be in #1 (if Young is in #2) or #2 (if Young is in #1).\n3. Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza.\n   The remaining higher-numbered spaces are #4, #5 and #6. \n   So Souza must be in #4 or #5, and Xu must be in #5 (if Souza is in #4) or #6 (if Souza is in #5).\n4. For the answers given:\n   A: Souza could be assigned #4, but doesn't have to be. It depends on where Xu is.\n   B: Togowa could be #2, but could also be #1. It depends on where Young is. \n   C: Vaughn will get whatever high-numbered space is left after Xu. Could be #5 or #6.\n   D: Xu could be assigned #6, but doesn't have to be. Xu could also be #5 if Souza is #4.\n   E: Young could be assigned #2, but could also be #1. It depends on where Togowa is.\n5. None of the answer choices MUST be true. Each one COULD be true depending on how the unassigned spaces are allocated, but none are definite.\nTherefore, there is not enough information to say with certainty that any of the given answer choices must be true.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
