        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists the compositions in an order in which they could be performed during the concert, from first through eighth?\nChoices:\n  A: L, P, S, R, O, T, F, H\n  B: O, T, P, F, S, H, R, L\n  C: P, T, F, S, L, R, O, H\n  D: P, T, F, S, O, R, L, H\n  E: T, F, P, R, O, L, S, H\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand all the constraints and conditions.\n - Consider each condition independently and its implications before trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n - Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.\n - Systematically evaluate each answer choice against the conditions, eliminating those that violate any condition.\n - Don't overconstraint the problem by assuming additional restrictions that are not stated in the question.\n - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which one fits all the conditions.\n"

This means there must be at least two compositions between F and R in either order.\n3. O is performed either first or fifth. \n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n5.
