Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully read and re-read the question and constraints.\n - Always consider each answer choice methodically.\n - Always try to construct concrete scenarios to test each answer choice.\n - Never assume an answer is impossible until you have thoroughly tried to find a valid scenario.\n - Always double-check that your chosen scenario satisfies all the given constraints.\n - Remember that for \"could be true\" questions, you only need to find one possible valid scenario.\n"

C cannot be true.\nD) Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n   Scenario: Olivia (Mon morning), Nina (Mon afternoon), George (Tue), Robert (Wed morning)\n   This works, so D could be true.\nE) Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n   Scenario: Nina (Mon), George (Tue), Robert (Wed morning), Helen (Wed afternoon)\n   This satisfies all constraints, so E could be true.\nIn summary, A, B, D, and E could all be true.
