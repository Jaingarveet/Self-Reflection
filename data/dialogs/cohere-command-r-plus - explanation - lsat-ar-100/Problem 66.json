The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fourth.\n  B: H is sixth.\n  C: R is fourth.\n  D: R is seventh.\n  E: Y is fifth.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted some of the conditions and made assumptions that led me to choose the wrong answer.
