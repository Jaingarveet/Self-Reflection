This means that K must be shown before L, which narrows down the options for when K and L can be shown.\n\nThought: \nGiven that J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning, there are only a few possible combinations for the order in which the houses can be shown. Taking into account the condition that L must be shown after K and before M, the possible combinations are as follows:\n\n1. Morning: K, L | Afternoon: M | Evening: J, 0, P\n2. Morning: L | Afternoon: K, M | Evening: J, 0, P\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that K and L must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and M must be shown in the afternoon.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
