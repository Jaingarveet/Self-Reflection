The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

This leaves Jiang and O'Neill, who each review one play that neither Kramer nor Lopez reviewed. As Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, Megregian must have also reviewed Tamerlane, along with Sunset and Undulation. This leaves Jiang having reviewed Sunset and Lopez having reviewed Undulation.\n\nThought: \nGiven that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Lopez does not review any plays that Kramer does, it can be deduced that Lopez reviews Undulation, and that Megregian reviews all three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation. This leaves Jiang with Sunset, and so the correct answer is Choice B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
