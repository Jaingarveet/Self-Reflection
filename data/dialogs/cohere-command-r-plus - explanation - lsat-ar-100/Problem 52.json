Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the condition \"At least one witness testifies on Monday\" as implying that exactly two witnesses would testify on Monday, given the other conditions.

Given that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and Hong does not testify on Monday, this means that Hong and one other witness (either Franco or Garcia) testify on Tuesday. This leaves the remaining witness (either Franco or Garcia) to testify on Monday. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Franco or Garcia testifies on Monday as either scenario satisfies the given conditions. As such, the correct answer is that exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday (Choice C).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
