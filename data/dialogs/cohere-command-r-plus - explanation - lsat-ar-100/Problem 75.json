The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

This means that Megregian reviews either Sunset and Tamerlane or Sunset and Undulation. If Megregian reviews Sunset and Tamerlane, then Lopez must review Undulation, and Jiang must review Sunset. But this scenario doesn't work because Lopez and Jiang can't both review Sunset, and Megregian can't review the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill. So, Megregian must review Sunset and Undulation. This means that Lopez must review Sunset, and Jiang must review Undulation. Thus, the correct answer is \"C: Jiang, Lopez.\""
