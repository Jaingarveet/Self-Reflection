Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

I made an error in my logic by not considering that Xu and Souza could be assigned numbers 1 and 2 (in either order) while still fulfilling the condition that Xu be assigned a higher number than Souza. This results in five possible combinations, making the correct answer \"D: four.\"\n\nThought: \nTogowa and Young can be assigned to any spaces except #1 and #2, as this would violate the rule that Young must be assigned a higher number than Togowa. This leaves four possible combinations for these two employees.\n\nSouza and Xu can be assigned to any spaces as long as Xu is assigned a higher number. This results in four possible combinations for these two employees.\n\nRobertson must be assigned space #1, #2, #3, or #4, leaving only two possible options.\n\nVaughn has no restrictions and can be assigned to any of the six spaces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is four employees (Togowa, Young, Souza, Xu) have limited choices, and their assignments can be arranged in a total of 4 x 4 = 16 different ways.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
