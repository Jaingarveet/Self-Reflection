Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order in which the breeds of kitten are featured in the pet shop, from day 1 though day 7?\nChoices:\n  A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese\n  B: Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx Himalayan, Manx\n  C: Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese\n  D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Siamese, Himalayan\n  E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"
