The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

Bay 6: grain\n2. Bay 5 or 6: livestock\n3. Bay 3 or 5: textiles\n4. Bay 4: produce\nThat's a total of four bays with completely determined cargo types.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
