This means that Franco and Hong cannot testify on Monday or Wednesday, so they must testify on Tuesday. We also know that two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so one more witness remains to be placed on Tuesday to fulfill that condition.

We are not given any information about whether Jackson can testify on Monday, so \"B\" is not a definitive answer. Therefore, the correct answer is \"D\".\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
