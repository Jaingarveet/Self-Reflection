Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\n  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\n  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\n  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my interpretation of the logic behind the cookie-baking schedule. \nI correctly identified the baking days for each type of cookie but failed to correctly identify which days would have two different kinds of cookies being baked.\n"
