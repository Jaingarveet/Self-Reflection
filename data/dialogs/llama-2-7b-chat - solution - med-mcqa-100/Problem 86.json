The elevated AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) and hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels are consistent with a malignant tumor in the kidney.\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is (D) Metastatic germ cell tumor. This type of tumor is a malignant germ cell tumor that originates in the testes and can metastasize to the kidney. The presence of elevated AFP and hCG levels supports this diagnosis.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
