This type of sampling is known as:\nChoices:\n  A: Simple random sampling\n  B: Statified random sampling\n  C: Systemic random sampling\n  D: Cluster random sampling\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. I selected option A, simple random sampling, which is not the correct answer. Upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is option C, systemic random sampling.\n\nSystemic random sampling involves selecting every 10th person from the population, ensuring that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This method is suitable for studying the prevalence of a disease or condition in a population.\n\nIn contrast, simple random sampling involves selecting a fixed number of individuals from the population, without any regard for their location or any other characteristic. This method may not provide an accurate representation of the population, especially if the population is not evenly distributed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, systemic random sampling.\n\nAnswer: C"
