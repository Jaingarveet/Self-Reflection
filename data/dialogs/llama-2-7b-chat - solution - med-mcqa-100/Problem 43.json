Upon further reflection, I realized that antisera is actually obtained from the blood of horses. This is because antisera is a serum that is used to treat diseases in animals, and it is typically produced by injecting a small amount of a specific disease-causing agent into a horse's bloodstream. The horse's immune system will then produce antibodies against the disease agent, which are collected and used to create the antisera.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], \"[REDACTED].\""
