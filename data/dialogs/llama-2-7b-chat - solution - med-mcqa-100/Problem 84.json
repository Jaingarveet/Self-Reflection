[REDACTED] increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by increasing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, allowing aqueous humor to flow more easily. [REDACTED], brimonidine, and brinzolamide decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by reducing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, thereby decreasing the flow of aqueous humor.\n"

The options are Timolol, Pilocarpine, Brimonidine, and Brinzolamide. I previously selected Brimonidine as the correct answer, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is actually Brinzolamide that increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Brimonidine, on the other hand, decreases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.\n\nAction: I will answer the question correctly by selecting Brinzolamide as the drug that increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.\n\nAnswer: Brinzolamide"
