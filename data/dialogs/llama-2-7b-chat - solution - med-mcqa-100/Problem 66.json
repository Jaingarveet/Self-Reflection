According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hepatitis A virus can be shed in faeces for several weeks before and after the onset of symptoms. The exact duration of shedding depends on various factors, including the individual's immune response and the severity of the infection.\n\nBased on my reflection, the correct answer is (C) One week before the symptoms and one week thereafter. This is because hepatitis A virus can be shed in faeces for up to two weeks before the onset of symptoms and for an additional two weeks after the symptoms appear.\n\nAction: I will answer the question with the correct choice, (C) One week before the symptoms and one week thereafter.\n\nAnswer: (C) One week before the symptoms and one week thereafter."
