Identify the given information: concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) = 1 x 10-6 moles/litre\n2. Calculate the pH of the solution using the pH formula: pH = -log[H+]\n3. Consider the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and calculate the pH of the solution using the updated formula: pH = -log[H+] - log[OH-]\n"

The correct answer is (B) Six.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the given information: the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) is 1 x 10-6 moles/litre. Using the pH formula, we can calculate the pH of the solution:\n\npH = -log[H+]\n\nSubstituting the given value of H+ concentration, we get:\n\npH = -log(1 x 10-6) = 6\n\nTherefore, the pH of the solution is 6.\n\nI hope this answer is correct, and I will make sure to double-check my calculations in the future."
