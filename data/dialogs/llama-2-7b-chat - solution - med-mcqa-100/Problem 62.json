        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nInitial Answer: I previously answered this question as \"C: Isthmus\". However, upon further reflection, I realize that the narrowest part of the uterine tube is actually the \"Ampulla\".\n\nReasoning:\nThe uterine tube, also known as the fallopian tube, has a narrow part called the ampulla. This is the area where the tube narrows to its smallest diameter, approximately 1-2 millimeters in diameter. The infundibulum, which is the wider part of the tube near the uterus, is not the narrowest part. The isthmus, which is the narrow part of the tube between the infundibulum and the ampulla, is even wider than the infundibulum. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Ampulla.\n\nConclusion:\nI apologize for my initial mistake and hope this reflection helps me to accurately answer this question in the future. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect on my previous answer and improve my knowledge."
