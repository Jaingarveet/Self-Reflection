The question asks for the biochemical test that is not raised in liver disorder, and I need to use my knowledge of biochemistry to identify the correct answer.\n\nFrom my understanding, ALP (Alanine Transaminase) and AST (Aspartate Transaminase) are both liver enzymes that are elevated in liver disorders. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.\n\nOn the other hand, lipase is an enzyme that is produced in the pancreas and is involved in digestion. It is not related to liver disorders, so option A is also incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is option D: ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase), which is also a liver enzyme but is not elevated in liver disorders.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
