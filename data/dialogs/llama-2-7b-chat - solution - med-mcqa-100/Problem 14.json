However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer.\n\nAnaerobic glycolysis does not involve an electron transport chain or ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, so the end product of anaerobic glycolysis is not ATP. Instead, the end product of anaerobic glycolysis is [REDACTED].\n\nTo calculate the end product of anaerobic glycolysis, we need to consider the chemical equation for glycolysis in the absence of oxygen:\n\nGlucose + 2NAD+ + 2ATP â†’ 2Pyruvate + 2NADH + 2ATP\n\nAs shown in the equation, 2 ATP are produced during glycolysis, but they are not the end product. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is pyruvate, which can be converted to lactate in muscle cells or to acetyl-CoA in the liver, leading to the production of ATP through the citric acid cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 2 ATP + 2 NADH.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
