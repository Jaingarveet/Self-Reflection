However, upon further reflection, I realized that the correct answer is that the facial artery terminates in the anastomosis with the branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n\nThe facial artery is a branch of the carotid artery that supplies blood to the face. It originates from the carotid bifurcation and runs along the carotid sheath, passing through the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The facial artery then divides into several branches, including the ophthalmic artery, which supplies blood to the eye. The facial artery terminates in the anastomosis with the branch of the ophthalmic artery, not the opposite side of the facial artery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n\n[REDACTED]"
