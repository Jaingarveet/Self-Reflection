The curator explicitly states that all prints sold in the store are of twentieth-century works.\n* **C:** This statement is not necessarily true. The curator only states that prints of works in the permanent collection are available. It doesn't guarantee that every such work has a print available.\n* **D:** This statement is not necessarily true. We only know that Nighthawks is not part of the permanent collection. We don't know if it's on loan or not.\n* **E:** This statement is not necessarily true. We only know that Nighthawks is not part of the permanent collection.
