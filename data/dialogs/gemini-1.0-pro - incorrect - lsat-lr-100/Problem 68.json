Therefore, the most useful information to evaluate the argument would be:\n**B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog**\nThis information directly addresses the claim about the likelihood of a stray cocker spaniel belonging to someone in Flynn Heights. Knowing the relative number of registered cocker spaniels compared to other breeds would provide a stronger basis for evaluating the argument's validity.\n## Action:\nAnswer(\"B\") \n"
