The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

If the groups had different sizes, it would be difficult to determine whether the difference in performance was due to age or simply to the difference in sample size. \n* **B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.** This information is not directly relevant to the conclusion about memory. The researchers answering the calls would not affect the participants' ability to remember to make the calls.\n* **C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.** This information is not helpful because the study is comparing people aged 65-75 to college students, who are likely to be younger than 40. \n* **D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.** This information is helpful because it ensures that the difference in performance was not due to one group having better access to telephones than the other.\n* **E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.** This information is helpful because it ensures that the difference in performance was not due to one group having more time to prepare than the other.\nTherefore, the least helpful information in establishing the conclusion is **B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.**\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
