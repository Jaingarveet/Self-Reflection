Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?\nChoices:\n  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.\n  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.\n  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.\n  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.\n  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

The high cost of film production means they need a large audience to recoup their investment, making maximizing viewers crucial. \n* **D**: While sponsors are important, their concern with purchasing power doesn't explain the difference in goals. \n* **E**: The popularity of free shows doesn't explain why maximizing viewership wouldn't be the primary goal for other shows. \nTherefore, the answer must be the option that highlights the difference in production costs and revenue generation between film and television.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
