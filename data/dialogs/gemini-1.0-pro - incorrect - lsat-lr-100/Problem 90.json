They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but it does not say that all objects without lithium are stars with less mass than the Sun.\n* **B**: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage states that stars with incompletely mixed elements have lithium in their atmospheres.\n* **C**: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage states that brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres, but it does not say that all objects with no lithium are brown dwarfs.\n* **D**: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium, but it does not say that all objects with lithium have more mass than the Sun.\n* **E**: This statement is not supported by the passage. The passage states that brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres, but it does not say that all objects less massive than a brown dwarf have no lithium.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the statement most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
