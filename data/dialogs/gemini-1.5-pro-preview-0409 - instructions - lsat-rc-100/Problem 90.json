        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as \"literature\" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nQuestion: Each of the following excerpts from the passage exhibits the author's attitude toward the novel Jazz EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: \"...whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest con1nbutions to North American art\" (lines 8-10)\n  B: \"In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told\" (lines 17-19)\n  C: \"The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice .....\" (lines 19-21)\n  D: \"... Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope .....\" (lines 49-51)\n  E: \"By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity ...\" (lines 52-54)\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

This description, while not necessarily negative, lacked the clear positive sentiment present in the other choices.\n**Lessons Learned:**\n* Pay closer attention to subtle differences in tone and wording. \n* Avoid assuming that neutral descriptions imply a positive attitude.\n* Focus on identifying the author's overall perspective on the subject matter.\n## Answering the Current Question:\nUsing the lessons learned, I will carefully analyze each excerpt to determine which one does NOT convey a positive attitude towards Jazz.\n**Analysis:**\n* **Choice A:** This excerpt praises African American music, highlighting its significance and contribution to art.  **Positive attitude.**\n* **Choice B:** This excerpt emphasizes the unique connection between music and storytelling in Jazz. **Positive attitude.**\n* **Choice C:** This excerpt describes the narrator's voice as \"disembodied,\" which is a neutral observation rather than a positive evaluation. **Potential answer.**\n* **Choice D:** This excerpt praises Morrison's ability to create a sense of improvisation within a structured narrative. **Positive attitude.**\n* **Choice E:** This excerpt commends Morrison's skill in simulating a musical style and showcasing her linguistic talent. **Positive attitude.**\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the excerpt that does NOT exhibit the author's positive attitude towards Jazz is:\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
