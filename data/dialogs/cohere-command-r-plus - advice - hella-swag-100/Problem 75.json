The correct completion to the text should provide practical advice that aligns with the theme of dealing with work-related pressure and criticism.\n\nChoice A: This option provides a quote from Richard Templar, suggesting that by acting as if you don't need the money, you can take back power in a difficult work situation. This advice aligns with the theme of the text and offers a practical strategy for dealing with pressure.\n\nChoice B: While this option continues the discussion about not caring what others say, it lacks the depth and practical advice offered in choice A. It also doesn't provide a clear completion to the text.\n\nChoice C: This option introduces a confusing phrase (\"jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl\") that detracts from the main message. It also doesn't provide a clear strategy or completion to the text.\n\nChoice D: While giving notice to someone could be a result of feeling extreme pressure, this option lacks the depth and practical advice offered in choice A. It also doesn't directly complete the text or align with the theme of dealing with criticism.\n\nTherefore, choice A is the most suitable completion to the text.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
