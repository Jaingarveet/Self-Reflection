Understand the given equivalences: 6 pita breads = 2 rolls, and 3 rolls = 5 baguettes.\n2. Find the equivalence for 2 baguettes in terms of rolls.\n3. Use the given equivalence to find the equivalence of that number of rolls in pita breads.\n4. Express the final answer in the simplest form.\n\nAdvice:\n- Carefully read and understand the relationships given in the question.\n- Identify the relevant information and equivalences that will help you solve the problem.\n- Systematically work through the problem, step-by-step, using the given information.\n- Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are making the correct comparisons and equivalences.\n- Simplify your final answer if possible."
