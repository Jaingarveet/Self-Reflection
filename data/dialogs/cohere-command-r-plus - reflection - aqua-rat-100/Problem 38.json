It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\nChoices:\n  A: 438\n  B: 550\n  C: 500\n  D: 450\n  E: 498\n\nThought: \nThe hollow cube consists of 3 smaller cubes in each direction, resulting in a total of $3^3 = 27$ smaller cubes.\nEach smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are a total of $27 \\times 6 = 162$ faces.\nOut of these, only the inner faces are not painted, which amounts to $5^3 = 125$ inner cube faces.\nThus, the number of unpainted faces is $162 - 125 = 37$.\nNow, each smaller cube has one face that is part of the outer surface and thus painted, so the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces is the same as the number of unpainted faces, i.e., 37.\nSince each smaller cube has 5 unpainted faces (as one is painted), the total number of unpainted faces is $37 \\times 5 = \\boxed{185}$.\n\nThis question requires a calculation that doesn't align precisely with the provided choices. The closest answer would be to select the choice closest to 185, which is 180, half-way between 175 and 190.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation: I made a calculation error in determining the number of smaller cubes and their unpainted faces. I correctly identified the number of smaller cubes in each direction as 3, but I incorrectly calculated the total number of smaller cubes and their unpainted faces. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Counting error\n- Underestimation\n\nSolution: The hollow cube consists of $5^3 = 125$ smaller cubes. Out of these, the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which are $3^3 = 27$ in total, will have some faces painted. Each of these outer smaller cubes has 5 unpainted faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is $27 \\times 5 = 135$. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Calculate the total number of smaller cubes within the hollow cube. \n2. Determine the number of smaller cubes on each face of the hollow cube that will have one face painted. \n3. Calculate the number of unpainted faces for each smaller cube on the outer surface. \n4. Find the total number of unpainted faces by multiplying the number of outer smaller cubes by the number of their unpainted faces. \n\nAdvice: \n - Pay close attention to the dimensions and sizes provided in the question. \n - Carefully count the number of elements involved, especially when dealing with three-dimensional shapes. \n - Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem. \n - Consider all relevant faces or elements that may contribute to the final count."
