(96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 112 / (n-4)\n\nWe know that the new contribution is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution:\nRs. 112 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4\n\nMultiplying both sides by (n-4) * n:\n112n - 448 = 96n - 384\n\nSimplifying:\n16n = 640\nn = 40\n\nSince n represents the original number of friends, the final answer must be n+4 = 44.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation: I incorrectly set up and solved the equation. I made a mistake in balancing the equation and incorrectly isolated the variable. I also overlooked the fact that the question asks for the number of friends who attended, which is a smaller number than the total number of friends.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Equation setup error\n- Isolation error\n- Oversight\n\nSolution: \nOriginal contribution = Rs. 96 / n \n\nAfter 4 friends did not show up: \nNew contribution = Rs. (96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 144 / (n-4) \n\nWe set up the equation: \nRs. 144 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4 \n\nMultiplying both sides by (n-4) yields: \n144 = 96 + 4n \n\nSubtracting 96 from both sides: \n48 = 4n \n\nDividing by 4: \nn = 12 \n\nThe number of friends who attended the picnic is n = 12. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the problem: friends planned to spend a certain amount, but some didn't show up, increasing the cost for those who attended. \n2. Set up two equations: one for the original plan and one for the updated plan. \n3. Isolate for 'n' in both equations. \n4. Set the two equations equal to each other, representing the relationship between the original and updated plans. \n5. Simplify the equation and solve for 'n'. \n6. Interpret the result: 'n' is the total number of friends, so subtract 4 to find the number who attended. \n\nAdvice: \n - Read the question carefully and identify the relevant information. \n - Clearly define variables and their meanings. \n - Set up equations based on the relationships between variables. \n - Always double-check your equation setup and variable isolation steps. \n - Pay attention to the specific details of the question, such as whether it asks for the total or a subset."
