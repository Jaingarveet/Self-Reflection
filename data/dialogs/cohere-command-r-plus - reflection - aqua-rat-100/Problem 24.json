Understand the variables: x = average of highest and lowest scores, y = average of the entire class, z = number of students.\n2. Recognize that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.\n3. Calculate the sum of the remaining scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers: zy - 2x.\n4. Determine the number of remaining students: z - 2.\n5. Find the average score for the remaining students by dividing the sum of their scores by the number of students: ((zy - 2x) / (z - 2)).\n6. Ensure your algebraic manipulations are correct and that you are properly applying the order of operations.\nAdvice: \n - Always define your variables clearly and understand what they represent.\n - Break down complex problems into simpler steps.\n - Double-check your assumptions and algebraic manipulations.\n - Pay attention to the specific values or variables mentioned in the question, and ensure you are considering all relevant information. \n - Practice similar problems to improve your familiarity and comfort with these types of algebraic manipulations."
