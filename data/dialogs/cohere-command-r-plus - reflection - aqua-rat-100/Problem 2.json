The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?\nChoices:\n  A: 40.8\n  B: 41.6\n  C: 42.2\n  D: 43.5\n  E: 44.8\n\nThought: \nThe total weight of the 10 vehicles is 10 x 12.2 = 122 tons.\nAfter adding the new truck, the total weight increased to (10 + 2.6) x 12.2 = 153.44 tons.\nSo, the weight of the heavy-duty truck = 153.44 - 122 = 31.44 tons.\n\nAnswer: D\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

I subtracted incorrectly and did not notice the mismatch between my calculated answer and the available choices.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Subtraction error\n- Mismatch error\n\nSolution: \nThe average of the 10 vehicles' weights is $12.2$ tons, so their total weight is $10 \\times 12.2 = 122$ tons. After adding the new truck, the average weight increased to $12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8$ tons, and the total weight increased to $14.8 \\times 11 = 162.8$ tons. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is $162.8 - 122 = \\mathbf{40.8}$ tons. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles by multiplying the average weight by the number of vehicles.\n2. Calculate the new average weight by adding the given increase.\n3. Calculate the total weight of the new group by multiplying the new average weight by the new number of vehicles (original + 1).\n4. Find the weight of the new truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight.\n5. Check your calculations and ensure the answer choice matches your calculated result. \n\nAdvice: \n- Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.\n- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid errors.\n- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the problem context. \n- Ensure your final answer is in the requested format and matches the available choices."
