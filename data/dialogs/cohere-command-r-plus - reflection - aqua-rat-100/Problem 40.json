Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I should have considered the transactions from each person's perspective and used consistent variables for each step of the calculation. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Equation setup error\n- Interpretation error\n- Inconsistent variable usage\n\nSolution: \n\nLet's assume John has x amount of money. \n\nAccording to Mark, if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, from Mark's perspective: \nJohn's contribution = 1/2 * x\nMark already had: 75 - (1/2)x\n\nAccording to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs. 75. So, from John's perspective: \nJohn's original amount + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75\nThis can be written as: x + (1/3)(2x - 75) = 75\n\nNow, we can solve for x: \n75 = x + (2/3)x - 25\n75 = (5/3)x - 25\n100 = (5/3)x\nx = 60\n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the variables: let John's money = x\n2. Interpret Mark's statement: from Mark's perspective, after receiving half of John's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's contribution + Mark's original money = Rs. 75\n3. Interpret John's statement: from John's perspective, after receiving one-third of Mark's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's original money + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75\n4. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation\n5. Plug the value of x back into the equations to find Mark's original money\n6. Calculate the answer choices to check which one matches our calculated amount\n\nAdvice: \n - Always read and interpret the information given in the question carefully. \n - Use consistent and clear variables for each person or object involved in the problem. \n - Set up equations based on the perspective of each person or object involved. \n - Double-check your equations and calculations to ensure they align with the information given in the question. \n - Solve one step at a time and regularly check your work to catch errors early on."
