Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

Read the question carefully to understand the given information.\n2. Identify the number of matches won and interpret \"30% of their matches\" as \"30% of the total matches played.\"\n3. Calculate the total number of matches played by the team.\n4. Calculate the number of matches lost by multiplying the total number of matches by 0.30.\n5. Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and clarify the meaning of each statement.\n- Understand the difference between \"30% of X\" and \"30% of the total,\" and be mindful of such nuances in the questions.\n- Calculate percentages accurately and practice common percentage calculations to improve your speed and accuracy."
