Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I made a simple arithmetic error in adding the equations and determining the value of \"x.\" This led to an incorrect final answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Equation error\n\nSolution: \nLet the man's rate along the current be \"x\" kmph and the current's rate be \"y\" kmph.\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the given information:\nx - y = 2 (the man's rate against the current)\nx + y = 4 (the man's rate in still water)\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSubstituting x into the equation x + y = 4:\n3 + y = 4\ny = 1\n\nNow, we can find the man's rate along the current:\nx = 3 kmph\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **E: 3 kmph**.\n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the given information: the man's rates in still water and against the current.\n2. Define variables: let 'x' be the man's rate along the current and 'y' be the current's rate.\n3. Set up a system of equations: use the given rates to create two equations.\n4. Solve the system: add the equations to find the value of 'x'.\n5. Substitute and solve: use the value of 'x' to find 'y' by substituting into the second equation.\n6. Interpret the result: the man's rate along the current is 'x' kmph.\n\nAdvice: \n - Clearly define variables and their meanings.\n - Set up equations precisely and double-check them.\n - Solve the system of equations accurately, checking each step.\n - Interpret the solution correctly, ensuring it makes sense in the context of the problem."
