        "content": "Explanation: \nI incorrectly assumed that the total number of black marbles was 21, but the question states that only 20 were put back in after the second draw. \nError Keywords:\n- Data misinterpretation\n- Inattention to detail\n- Arithmetic error\nSolution: \nThere are 20 black marbles in the bag after the second round. \nThe probability of pulling out a black marble the second time is still 1/20. \nThis probability represents the ratio of black marbles to all marbles in the bag. \nSo, we set up the equation: 1/20 = 20/Q. \nSolving for Q, we get Q = 400.\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the problem: There are two rounds of drawing marbles, and the key information is the number of black marbles after each round and the probability it yields for the second round. \n2. Identify the given data: 20 initial black marbles, 20 pulled and 1 black in the second round, probability of 1/20 for the second round. \n3. Calculate the total number of black marbles after the second round: 20 initial + 1 new = 21 black marbles. \n4. Recognize the misinterpretation: The question states that only 20 marbles were put back, so the total number of black marbles is 20, not 21. \n5. Set up the equation: The probability 1/20 represents the ratio of black marbles to the total, so 1/20 = 20/Q. \n6. Solve for Q: Multiply both sides by 20Q to get 20 = 20Q/20, which simplifies to Q = 400. \nAdvice: \n - Read the question and data carefully to avoid misinterpretations. \n - Pay attention to detail, especially when multiple similar numbers are involved. \n - Double-check your understanding of the problem and data before solving. \n - Take a step back if you get a conflicting result; review the question and your solution for errors."
