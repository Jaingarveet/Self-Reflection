The warning here is to choose a confidant wisely, so the information doesn't reach the frenemy, which could make the situation worse.\n\nChoice A is incorrect as it doesn't address the issue of confiding in someone safely. Choice B is incorrect as it suggests writing things down, which is not relevant to the question of who to talk to. Choice C is incorrect as it advises openness with the frenemy, which could be risky. \n\nChoice D is correct as it emphasizes the need for caution when choosing who to talk to, ensuring the person will not pass on concerns to the frenemy. This reflects the text's advice to be discerning when confiding in someone about a potentially tricky relationship dynamic.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
