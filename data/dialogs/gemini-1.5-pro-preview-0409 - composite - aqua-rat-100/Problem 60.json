        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?\nChoices:\n  A: 80°\n  B: 130°\n  C: 140°\n  D: 160°\n  E: 220°\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the meaning of \"[REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED].\" I incorrectly assumed it meant [REDACTED] was the midpoint of arc A[REDACTED], dividing it into two equal arcs. However, it actually means that line segment A[REDACTED] bisects the angle formed by arc A[REDACTED], not necessarily dividing the arc length equally.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Geometry terminology\n - Angle bisector vs. midpoint\nSolution:\n1. Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], angle AB[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/2 = [REDACTED].\n2. Angle AB[REDACTED] is an inscribed angle, so it intercepts an arc twice its measure. Therefore, minor arc A[REDACTED] = 2 * [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] (which we already knew).\n3.  Minor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/2 = [REDACTED] (since [REDACTED] bisects arc AC).\n4.  Minor arc C[REDACTED] = minor arc B[REDACTED] - minor arc B[REDACTED] = 150° - [REDACTED] = 70°.\n5.  Minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + 70° = 150°.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the concept of an angle bisector in the context of circles and arcs. Remember that it bisects the angle, not necessarily the arc length.\n2. Recall the relationship between inscribed angles and the arcs they intercept: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n3. Break down the problem into smaller parts: find the measures of individual arcs (A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], CD) based on the given information and relationships.\n4. Combine the measures of relevant arcs to find the measure of the desired arc (AD).\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the specific wording of geometry problems, especially terms like \"bisect\" which can have different meanings depending on the context.\n- Review key geometric concepts and relationships, such as those between angles and arcs in circles.\n- Draw a clear diagram to visualize the problem and relationships between different parts of the circle.\n- Double-check your calculations and ensure your answer is consistent with the given information and geometric principles.\n"
