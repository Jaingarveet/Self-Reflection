Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Read and understand all the constraints carefully. \n - Identify the fixed positions and their implications for the remaining spaces. \n - Consider all possibilities and test them against the constraints. \n - Ensure your interpretation of the constraints is consistent and logical. \n - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions; always validate your reasoning. \n - Practice similar spatial reasoning and logic problems to improve your analytical skills.\n"

So, A is false.\n- Choice B: If the pharmacy is in space 4, then the restaurant at the opposite end would be in space 1, and vice versa. Therefore, the pharmacy could be in space 7, but it's not a must. So, B is false.\n- Choice C: As explained above, with the veterinarian in space 5, a restaurant can be in space 4, satisfying the separation rule. So, C is true.\n- Choice D: The shoe store could be in space 6, but it's not a must as other businesses could occupy that space. So, D is false.\n- Choice E: The toy store cannot be in space 3 because it would violate the separation rule between the restaurants. So, E is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
