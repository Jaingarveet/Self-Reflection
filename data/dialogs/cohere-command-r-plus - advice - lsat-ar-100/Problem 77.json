Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Understand the rules and conditions thoroughly. Ensure you interpret \"must be higher/lower\" as providing flexibility rather than strict limitations. \n- Consider the most flexible scenarios first, as these will provide the lower bound for the number of possible options. \n- Systematically work through each employee's options, considering the impact of each possible assignment on the remaining employees.\n"

I now understand that the question asks for how many employees there are for whom there are only two possible parking space options. \n\nFirst, we can assign Robertson to parking space #4, which satisfies all conditions and leaves the most flexibility for the remaining employees. \n\nNow, we can assign Young to either #5 or #6, as long as Togowa isn't assigned #6. So, Young has 2 options. \n\nTogowa can be assigned any space from #1 to #5, so they have 5 options. \n\nSouza and Xu must be on adjacent spots due to the rule regarding their assignments. They can be assigned to spots #1 and #2 or spots #2 and #3, so they each have 2 options. \n\nVaughn has the remaining spot, so they have only 1 option. \n\nIn total, 2 + 1 = 3 employees have only 2 possible space options.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
