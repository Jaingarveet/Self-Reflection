Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: In the order in which the articles are edited, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: first\n  B: third\n  C: fourth\n  D: fifth\n  E: sixth\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n- Create a systematic approach by placing S in each position and evaluating the consequences for other variables. \n- Break down complex conditions into simpler ones. For example, \"S can be earlier than Q only if Q is [REDACTED]\" can be simplified to \"if S is [REDACTED] or second, then Q cannot be [REDACTED] or second.\" \n- Consider the implications of each condition individually and in combination. \n- Look for contradictions or conflicts with the conditions when evaluating each arrangement. \n- Always consider all options and don't stop at the [REDACTED] valid arrangement. Ensure that no other valid arrangements contradict your conclusion.\n"
