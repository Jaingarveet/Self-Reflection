        "content": "Thought: To answer this question, we need to determine which statement describes a schedule that cannot be arranged while meeting all the given conditions.\n\nLet's start by scheduling Iturbe on Wednesday and Hong not on Monday, per the conditions. We also know that two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, so we can schedule Franco and Garcia together on Tuesday, as they cannot testify on the same day. This leaves Hong, Jackson, and one more (either Franco or Garcia) to fill the Monday and Wednesday slots. \n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\nA: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. FALSE. This can be true if we schedule Franco with Garcia on Tuesday, Hong on Monday, and Jackson on Wednesday.\n\nB: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. FALSE. This can be true if we reschedule Franco to Wednesday with Iturbe.\n\nC: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. TRUE. This meets the condition of two witnesses testifying on Tuesday, and there are no conflicting conditions for this arrangement.\n\nD: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday... TRUE. Scheduling Garcia on Monday is possible per condition D, and Hong can then be scheduled on Wednesday with Jackson or Franco.\n\nE: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday... TRUE. Jackson can testify on Tuesday with either Hong or Garcia, leaving Wednesday and Monday free for the remaining two witnesses.\n\nAnswer: So, the statement that cannot be true is choice 'C', where both Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday, as Franco must also be scheduled on Tuesday, according to the conditions."
