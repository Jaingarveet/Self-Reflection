The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Landon\n  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Novetzke\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Interpret the constraints carefully and systematically. \n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated or implied by the constraints. \n- Consider all possibilities and apply the constraints consistently. \n- Double-check your interpretation and reasoning by verifying that your chosen answer satisfies all the given conditions.\n"
