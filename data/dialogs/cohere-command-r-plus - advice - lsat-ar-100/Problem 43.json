The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: J is second.\n  B: J is third\n  C: Q is first.\n  D: Q is third\n  E: R is seventh.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Create a logical framework that accounts for all conditions.\n - Be systematic in your approach to ordering or sequencing problems.\n - Consider all provided conditions and how they interact.\n - Avoid making assumptions beyond what is stated in the conditions.\n - Double-check your interpretation of the conditions and their implications.\n"
