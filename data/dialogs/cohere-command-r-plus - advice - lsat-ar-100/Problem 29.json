At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always start by identifying the given conditions and direct implications. \n - Work through each step logically, considering all options and their implications. \n - Avoid overthinking and focus on the given information and explicit conditions. \n - Ensure you consider all possibilities and don't make assumptions beyond what is given. \n - Double-check your reasoning and the final answer.\n"

This leaves the middle and top shelves for O, K, and F/M.\n\nI is placed on the middle shelf and K is on a higher shelf than F, so K and O cannot be on the middle shelf as this would mean the top shelf only has one book. Therefore, K and O must be on the top shelf together. This means that F and M are also on the top shelf together.\n\nAs a result, statement A must be true: F and G are placed on the same shelf.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
