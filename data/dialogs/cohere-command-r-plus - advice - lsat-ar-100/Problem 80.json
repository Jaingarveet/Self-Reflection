Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand the conditions carefully, ensuring a clear interpretation. \n- Do not make assumptions or jump to conclusions; work through each step logically. \n- Consider all conditions together, rather than in isolation, to avoid missing interactions between them. \n- Remember that the conditions must all be met simultaneously, so each option should be scrutinized thoroughly. \n- Double-check your interpretation and solution to prevent errors arising from misunderstandings.\n"

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n1. Togowa and Young: Togowa is #2 and Young is #3, so Young is assigned a higher number.\n2. Xu and Souza: Xu is #6 and Souza is #4, so Xu is assigned a higher number.\n3. Robertson and Young: Robertson is #4 and Young is #3, so Robertson is assigned a higher number.\n4. Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is one of the specified options (#1, #2, #3, or #4).\n\nAll other arrangements violate at least one condition.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
