K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read and re-read the conditions and choices carefully. \n- Break down complex conditions into simpler components. \n- Systematically apply each condition to the choices. \n- Avoid making rushed assumptions or interpretations. \n- Maintain a clear and organized thought process. \n- Regularly review and reflect on your reasoning to identify any potential oversights or misinterpretations.\n"

This eliminates choices C and D. \n\nNext, O is on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the bottom shelf. This eliminates choices A and B, as they do not include L on the bottom shelf. \n\nNow, we are left with choices E and G, H, L, M. We know that F and M are on the same shelf, and there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. This condition rules out choice E, as it places F and M on different shelves and does not adhere to the requirement of at least two books on each shelf. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be choice G, H, L, and M for the bottom shelf.\n\nAction: Answer(\"G\")"
