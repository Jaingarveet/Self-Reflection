Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the conditions carefully and identify any absolute requirements and flexible options. \n - Look for explicit pairings or groupings that must be kept together. \n - Identify any conditional statements that provide flexibility in arrangements. \n - Consider multiple valid arrangements that satisfy all conditions. \n - Avoid focusing too narrowly on one possible arrangement; explore alternatives. \n - Double-check your interpretation of the conditions to ensure it allows for all valid possibilities.\n"
