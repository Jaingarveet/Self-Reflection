        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand all the conditions and rules governing the parking space assignments.\n- Carefully interpret the conditions, avoiding assumptions or oversimplifications.\n- Systematically work through each possible assignment, considering all conditions and constraints.\n- Remember that the question asks for a definite consequence, so focus on identifying the options that must be true based on the given information.\n"

Therefore, Young must be assigned #5 or #6.\n\nNow, considering the condition that Young must have a higher number than Togowa, we can deduce that Togowa must have #2, #3, or #4. Togowa cannot have #4, as this would force Young into #6, leaving no suitable options for Robertson. So, Togowa could be assigned #2 or #3.\n\nWith these assignments, the conditions for Xu and Souza are met, as they can be assigned any of the remaining spaces, which are higher-numbered.\n\nSo, the only definite consequence of assigning Robertson parking space #3 is that Togowa will be assigned #2.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
