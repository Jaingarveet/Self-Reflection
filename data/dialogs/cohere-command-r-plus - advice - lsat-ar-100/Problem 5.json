There are eight books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, and O.\n2. There are three shelves: top, middle, and bottom.\n3. At least two books on each shelf.\n4. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n5. Specific book placements:\n    - I is on the middle shelf.\n    - K is on a higher shelf than F.\n    - O is on a higher shelf than L.\n    - F is on the same shelf as M.\n\nNow, let's analyze the choices:\n\nChoice A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\nThis cannot be determined as true based on the given conditions. While O is on a higher shelf than L, we don't have specific information about its placement relative to M.\n\nChoice B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\nThis is not necessarily true. K is on a higher shelf than F, but we don't have information about its placement relative to G.\n\nChoice C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\nThis must be true based on the given conditions. We know that I is on the middle shelf, and K, which is on a higher shelf than F, cannot be on the middle shelf (as that would violate the condition that at least two books are on each shelf). Therefore, F must be on the top shelf, and I is on a higher shelf (the middle shelf) than F.\n\nChoice D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\nThis cannot be determined as there is no information about the placement of G relative to O.\n\nChoice E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nWhile we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, we can't conclude that F is also higher than L based on the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n\nThis question required careful analysis of the given conditions and systematic elimination of choices through logical reasoning.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
