The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand the context and question carefully.\n- Break down the conditions and constraints into manageable components.\n- Avoid making assumptions or overgeneralizing.\n- Consider all possibilities and apply logical deduction systematically.\n- Double-check your interpretations and deductions to ensure they align with the given conditions.\n"

I incorrectly assumed that Kramer and Lopez reviewed the same plays, and as a result, my interpretation of the conditions was inaccurate. \n\nThe correct answer is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so Megregian reviews 3 plays, leaving 2 plays for the other 4 students.\n- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This means that Sunset and Undulation need to be distributed among Jiang, Lopez, and O'Neill.\n- Exactly two students review the same plays, so one of Jiang, Lopez, and O'Neill must review the same two plays as each other.\n- Exactly three students review Undulation, so O'Neill must review Sunset, and either Jiang or Lopez must review Undulation (along with Megregian and one other student).\n\nTherefore, the only definitive statement is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset."
