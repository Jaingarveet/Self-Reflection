The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Read and understand all the conditions before analyzing the choices. \n- Pay close attention to the wording of each condition, especially terms like \"at least,\" \"at most,\" \"cannot,\" and \"must.\" \n- Be systematic in your analysis by checking each condition for each choice. \n- Ensure that your interpretation of the conditions is consistent throughout your analysis. \n- Double-check your reasoning for each option to avoid overlooking any relevant conditions or restrictions.\n"

Choice B also violates the condition that \"at least one scientist of each of the three types must be on the panel\" as it includes two chemists (K and M) and no zoologist. Choice E can be eliminated because it includes only one botanist and one chemist, violating the requirement to have at least one scientist of each type. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice D, which satisfies all the conditions.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
