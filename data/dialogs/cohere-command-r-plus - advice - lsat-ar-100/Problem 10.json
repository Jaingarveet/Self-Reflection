The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the organizer's selection of works?\nChoices:\n  A: one French novel, two Russian novels, one French play, one Russian play\n  B: two French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays, one Russian play\n  C: two French novels, two Russian novels, two French plays\n  D: three French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays\n  E: three French novels, two Russian novels, one Russian play\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n- Read and understand all constraints carefully, paying attention to minimum and maximum requirements, relationships, and dependencies. \n- Systematically evaluate each option against all constraints, checking off each requirement as you go. \n- Don't stop at the first valid option; continue evaluating all options to ensure you don't miss a better solution. \n- Double-check your interpretation of constraints and your evaluation logic to catch any misunderstandings or errors.\n"
