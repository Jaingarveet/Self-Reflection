However, the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery are not direct branches of the internal carotid artery, but rather connect the anterior and posterior circulations of the brain.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe anterior communicating artery is not a direct branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery. It connects the left and right anterior cerebral arteries and is part of the circle of Willis. The anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and posterior communicating artery are all direct branches of the internal carotid artery. Therefore, the correct answer is \"A: Anterior communicating.\""
