The presenting symptom is an unstable lie.\nPossible causes of an unstable lie at this gestational age include oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, and uterine anomalies.\nOligohydramnios is a condition characterized by a decrease in amniotic fluid volume, which can cause an unstable lie. However, it is not typically associated with a history of normal deliveries.\nPlacenta previa is a condition where the placenta implants in the lower uterine segment, covering the cervix. It can cause vaginal bleeding and is a risk factor for preterm delivery, but it is not typically associated with an unstable lie.\nPelvic tumors can cause an unstable lie by displacing the uterus, but they are rare and not typically associated with a history of normal deliveries.\nUterine anomalies, such as a bicornuate or septate uterus, can cause an unstable lie by altering the shape of the uterus. They are also associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery and malpresentation.\nBased on the patient's history of normal deliveries and the presenting symptom of an unstable lie, uterine anomalies are the most likely cause.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
