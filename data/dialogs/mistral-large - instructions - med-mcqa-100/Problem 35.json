The patient's age and presentation are also consistent with a congenital heart defect.\nThe most probable diagnosis is Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection (TAPVC), which is a congenital heart defect where the pulmonary veins do not connect normally to the left atrium. Instead, they connect to the right atrium or one of its systemic veins. This results in increased blood flow to the lungs and heart failure.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
