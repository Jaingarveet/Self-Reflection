It is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene, which encodes a protein involved in phosphate regulation. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting \"AR\" as the mode of inheritance. However, upon further reflection, I realized that Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, not autosomal recessive. I also reviewed the characteristics of the disorder and confirmed that it is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene. Therefore, the correct answer is \"XR\". I will double-check my answer to ensure accuracy before submitting it."
