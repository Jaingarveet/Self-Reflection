However, upon further reflection, I realized that while MRI is useful in identifying soft tissue damage or nerve compression, it is not necessary for identifying the bony abnormalities associated with spondylolisthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is \"MRI\" as it is not useful in investigating the condition specifically. I will make sure to double-check my answer in the future to ensure accuracy."
