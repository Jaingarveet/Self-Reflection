Similar strategies can be used to break other habits.

        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I thought the answer was referring to the best strategy to help someone quit smoking, rather than identifying the assumption on which the argument depends.\n\nThe correct answer is C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n\nThe argument assumes that exaggerating the dangers of smoking will motivate the smoker to quit. The argument also assumes that this strategy can be applied to break other habits. Therefore, option C is the best answer.\n\nOption A is not the assumption on which the argument depends. While it may be true that people tend to believe what doctors tell them, the argument does not rely on this assumption.\n\nOption B is also not the assumption on which the argument depends. Although some techniques that help people quit smoking may also help people break other habits, this is not the main point of the argument.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the argument relies on the idea that people can be deceived into breaking their habits. If people generally did not find it easy to deceive themselves, the argument would not work.\n\nOption E is not relevant to the argument. While a doctor may be justified in deceiving a patient in certain circumstances, this is not the main point of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit."
