Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is: \"We must market our programs more aggressively.\"\n2. Identify the premises and assumptions made in the argument.\nThe premises are:\n* \"We will be forced to reduce spending next year if we do not increase our enrollment.\"\n* \"The quality of the education we provide will be maintained.\"\nThe assumptions are:\n* The university's current spending level is not sustainable without an increase in enrollment.\n* Increasing enrollment is necessary to maintain the quality of education.\n3. Evaluate each choice and determine which one supports the conclusion.\n\nA: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it increases its enrollment.\nThis choice is not related to the conclusion and is, in fact, the opposite of the assumption made in the argument.\n\nB: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it increases its enrollment.\nThis choice is related to the first premise but does not address the need to market programs more aggressively.\n\nC: The university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively.\nThis choice supports the conclusion by suggesting that marketing programs more aggressively will lead to increased enrollment, which is necessary to avoid reducing spending.\n\nD: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.\nThis choice is related to the second premise but does not address the need to market programs more aggressively.\n\nE: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it markets its programs more aggressively.\nThis choice is similar to option B, but it addresses the marketing of programs rather than enrollment. It does not support the conclusion.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
