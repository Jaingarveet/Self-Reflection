I thought the question was asking about the consistency of a legislator's actions, but it's actually asking about the consistency of a political party's policy.\n\nThe correct answer is A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n\nThe argument in the editorial depends on assuming that if a political party expresses a goal as worthy, then it should be consistent in its policy and not claim that the government should not increase spending on education. The party's policy is inconsistent because it claims that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but then says that the government should not increase spending on education.\n\nTherefore, option A is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
