It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.\n  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.\n  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.\n  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

After reevaluating the question and the given choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n\nThe curator's argument relies on the assumption that the hippopotamus' broken legs were intentionally broken by the ancient Egyptians as part of their religious beliefs. If the legs were broken through natural occurrence, such as erosion or damage during transportation, then the curator's conclusion that the hippopotamus was a religious object would be invalid. Therefore, choice (D) is the required assumption for the curator's argument.\n\nMy previous answer, (C) The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it, is not a required assumption for the curator's argument. While it is possible that the tomb was not reentered, this fact is not necessary to support the curator's conclusion. The curator's argument focuses on the intention behind the breaking of the hippopotamus' legs, not the condition of the tomb.\n\nI hope this corrected answer and explanation provide a better understanding of the question and the required assumption for the curator's argument."
