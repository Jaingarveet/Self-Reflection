This assumption is flawed because it ignores the possibility that technological advances can be both commercially viable and beneficial to society. In fact, many technological innovations have been driven by a desire to solve societal problems and improve people's lives, and have also been commercially successful. Therefore, this assumption is vulnerable to criticism.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
