The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action\n  B: presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems\n  C: infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change\n  D: undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians\n  E: presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Identify the claim made by the political scientist's argument.\n2. Identify the assumption made by the political scientist's argument.\n3. Evaluate the assumption to determine if it is supported by evidence or justification.\n4. Consider alternative explanations for the phenomenon being observed.\n5. Determine if the argument's conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n6. Consider if the argument addresses all relevant factors that may contribute to the phenomenon.\n"
