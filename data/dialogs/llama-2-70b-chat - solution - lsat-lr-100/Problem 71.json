        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the information given:\n\n* The museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.\n* Prints of all the latter works (i.e., permanent collection) are available in the museum store.\n* The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n\nThis choice is too broad. It includes prints of works that are on loan from private collectors, which are not necessarily part of the permanent collection. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nB: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.\n\nThis choice is correct. The museum only displays twentieth-century works, and the prints sold in the museum store are of works that are either part of the permanent collection or on loan from private collectors. Therefore, all prints sold in the museum store are copies of twentieth-century works.\n\nC: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n\nThis choice is incorrect. The museum may not have prints of all the works that are displayed, especially if they are on loan from private collectors.\n\nD: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.\n\nThis choice is incorrect. Hopper's Nighthawks is a twentieth-century work, but it is not on loan to the museum from a private collector. It is only available as a print in the museum store.\n\nE: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\n\nThis choice is correct. Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum, as it is only available as a print in the museum store.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work."
