After re-reading the question and choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) it treats a change that is required for virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills as a change that will guarantee the virtual elimination of those ills.\n\nThe argument made by Arnot assumes that by making certain fundamental changes in government, we can virtually eliminate our most vexing social ills. However, this conclusion relies on the dubious assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public. The argument fails to consider the possibility that even if the changes are made, the government may still act in its own interest rather than the public's. Therefore, choice (B) accurately expresses a flaw in the argument's reasoning.\n\nI mistakenly chose (C) it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true. While this choice may be true in some cases, it does not accurately describe the flaw in Arnot's argument. Arnot's argument relies on a faulty assumption, rather than failing to consider the possibility that some assumptions may be true.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to correctly answer the question this time.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
