However, I can provide general information on the topic.\n\nPeter and Yoko have different opinions on whether today's children's stories should have clearly immoral characters. Peter believes that these characters are necessary to teach children the consequences of being bad, while Yoko thinks that the characters in children's stories still have immoral traits, but they are not as frightening as they used to be, which is an improvement.\n\nThe question asks which statement best describes Peter and Yoko's disagreement. The correct answer is [REDACTED], as Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories [REDACTED].\n\nIt's important to note that children's stories have evolved over time, and the portrayal of immoral characters has changed. Some stories may still have clearly immoral characters, while others may have more nuanced and complex characters that are not necessarily good or bad. The purpose of children's stories can also vary, with some aiming to teach moral lessons, while others aim to entertain or promote imagination. Ultimately, the type of characters and themes in children's stories depends on the author's intentions and the audience's preferences."
