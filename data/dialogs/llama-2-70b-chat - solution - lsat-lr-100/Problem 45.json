The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After alL cars are utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the reasoning in the art critic's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The Woemer Journalism Award for criticism should not be given to a writer who portrays utilitarian objects as works of art.\n  B: Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.\n  C: Unless a review is written for the purpose of revealing important truths about the writer's culture, that review should not be considered to be criticism.\n  D: The Woerner JournalismAward for criticism should not be given to writers who do not consider themselves to be critics.\n  E: All writing that reveals important truths about a culture should be considered to be criticism.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\n1.

I thought the issue was that Nan Paulsen's reviews were not critical enough, but the actual issue is that she was reviewing utilitarian objects, which do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.\n\nThis time, I carefully read the question and identified the principle that supports the art critic's argument. The principle is that reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This principle is stated in choice B. Therefore, I chose answer B.\n\nIt's important to note that choice A is incorrect because it focuses on the writer's intention, whereas the art critic's argument focuses on the nature of the objects being reviewed. Choice C is also incorrect because it goes beyond the scope of the art critic's argument, which only concerns the appropriateness of giving the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism to a writer who reviews utilitarian objects. Choice D is not relevant to the art critic's argument. Choice E is incorrect because it is too broad and includes all types of writing, not just criticism."
