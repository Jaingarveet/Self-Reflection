Larew and Mendota disagree about whether the change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Larew argues that the percentage increase in average income for the lowest quintile is higher than that of the highest quintile, indicating a relative increase in economic prosperity. Mendota, on the other hand, argues that the absolute amount of the increase in average income was greater for the highest quintile.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: The average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile. This answer choice aligns with Larew's argument that the percentage change in average income is a meaningful way to measure changes in economic prosperity."
