But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.\nQuestion: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that\nChoices:\n  A: the press can publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives\n  B: one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it\n  C: the publishing of information about the personal lives of private individuals cannot be libelous\n  D: if one has an obligation to do something then one has a right to do it\n  E: the press's right to publish always outweighs the individual's right not to be libeled\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Identify the argument's assumption that [REDACTED].\n2. Recognize that this assumption is not necessarily true, as the press may choose not to exercise their right to publish a story.\n3.

The press may consider factors such as privacy, ethics, or the potential harm that the story may cause to individuals or communities.\n\nStep 3: Identify the correct answer choice, \"[REDACTED],\" which states that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that [REDACTED].\nThe correct answer choice is B: one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it. The argument assumes that the press's right to publish implies an obligation to publish, without considering the possibility that the press may choose not to exercise that right.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it."
