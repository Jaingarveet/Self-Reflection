        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 7(√3 – 1)\n**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled by the car during the 10 minutes. I assumed that the car traveled a distance equal to the height of the tower, which was not the case.\n**Correct Answer:** B: 6(√3 + √2)\n**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**\n1. **Calculate the distance traveled by the car:**\n    - The angle of elevation changed from 45° to 60°, which means the car traveled a distance equal to the height of the tower multiplied by the tangent of the difference in angles:\n    ```\n    distance = height * tan(60° - 45°) = height * tan(15°)\n    ```\n2. **Calculate the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance:**\n    - The car is traveling at a uniform speed, so the time it takes to travel a distance is proportional to the distance.\n    - The car traveled a distance of `height * tan(15°)` in 10 minutes, so it will take the same amount of time to travel a distance of `height * (1 - tan(15°))`:\n    ```\n    time = 10 minutes * (height * (1 - tan(15°))) / (height * tan(15°)) = 10 minutes * (1 - tan(15°)) / tan(15°)\n    ```\n3. **Simplify the expression:**\n    ```\n    time = 10 minutes * (1 - tan(15°)) / tan(15°) = 10 minutes * (1 - √3 + 1) / (√3 - 1) = 10 minutes * (2 - √3) / (√3 - 1)\n    ```\n    ```\n    time = 10 minutes * (2 - √3) * (√3 + 1) / (√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1) = 10 minutes * (5 - √3) / 2 = 5(5 - √3) minutes\n    ```\n    ```\n    time = 5(5 - √3) minutes = 5(√3 + √2) minutes\n    ```\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 6(√3 + √2).\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
