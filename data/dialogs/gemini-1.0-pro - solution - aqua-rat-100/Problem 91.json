Identify the starting point of [REDACTED].\n2. Identify the direction and distance of each movement.\n3. Calculate the net movement in each direction (north-south and east-west).\n4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the total distance from the starting point.\n```\nNet movement north: [REDACTED] north - [REDACTED] south = 0km\nNet movement east: [REDACTED] east - [REDACTED] west = [REDACTED]\nTotal distance: sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = [REDACTED]\n```\n"
