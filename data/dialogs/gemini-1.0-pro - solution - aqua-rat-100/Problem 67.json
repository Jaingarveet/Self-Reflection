Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nChoices:\n  A: 12/25\n  B: 3/2\n  C: 3\n  D: 2\n  E: 25/3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nSix pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nLet x be the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.\n6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls\n[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes\n[REDACTED] baguettes = x pita breads\nCombining these proportions, we get:\n(6 pita breads) / ([REDACTED] rolls) = ([REDACTED] rolls) / (5 baguettes) = ([REDACTED] baguettes) / (x pita breads)\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n(6 pita breads) * (5 baguettes) * (x pita breads) = ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] baguettes)\nSimplifying, we get:\n[REDACTED]0x = 1[REDACTED]\nx = 1[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]0 = [REDACTED]/5\nTherefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED]/5 pita breads.\n"
