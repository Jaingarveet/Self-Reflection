        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 500\n**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**\nMy previous approach involved calculating the total number of small cubes (125) and subtracting the number of cubes on the outer surface (26). However, this method failed to account for the hollow interior of the larger cube, which contains unpainted faces on the smaller cubes.\n**Correct Approach:**\n1. **Calculate the total number of small cubes:** 5^3 = 125\n2. **Calculate the number of small cubes on the outer surface:** 6 * (5^2) = 150 (6 faces, each with 5^2 small cubes)\n3. **Calculate the number of small cubes with unpainted faces:** 125 - 150 = -25\n**Error in Previous Approach:**\nThe negative result (-25) in step 3 indicates an error in the calculation. This is because the method did not consider the hollow interior, which contributes unpainted faces.\n**Corrected Approach:**\nTo account for the hollow interior, we need to subtract the number of small cubes inside the hollow space. This can be calculated as the volume of the hollow space divided by the volume of a small cube: (4^3) / (1^3) = 64.\nTherefore, the corrected calculation for unpainted faces is:\n125 (total small cubes) - 150 (outer surface cubes) - 64 (hollow interior cubes) = 11\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 11.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\") \n"
