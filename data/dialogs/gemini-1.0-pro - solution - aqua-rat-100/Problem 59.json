I have reflected on my mistake and realized that I did not consider the percentage of black marbles in the bag after the first 20 were painted black and returned.\nHere's the correct solution:\n1. After the first 20 marbles were painted black, the bag contained 20 black marbles and 20 white marbles.\n2. The percentage of black marbles in the bag after the first 20 were painted black is 20 / 40 = 50%.\n3. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, then 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time represents 50% of the total marbles in the bag.\n4. Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is Q = 20 * 2 = 40.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
