Let x be the number of matches played by Sachin in this season.\n2. The total number of runs scored by Sachin in this season is 51x.\n3. In the finals, Sachin scores 78 runs.\n4. The total number of runs scored by Sachin in this season, including the finals, is 51x + 78.\n5. The batting average of Sachin after the finals is 54.\n6. Using the formula above, we can set up the following equation:\n```\n54 = (51x + 78) / x\n```\n7. Solving for x, we get:\n```\nx = 11\n```\nTherefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 11.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
