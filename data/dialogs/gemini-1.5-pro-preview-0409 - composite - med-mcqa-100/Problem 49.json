While bicarbonate is an important buffer system in the blood, its pKa (6.1) is not equal to the physiological pH of blood (7.4). \nTherefore, option A is incorrect. \nThe effectiveness of a buffer also depends on the concentrations of the buffering components. Bicarbonate is present in high concentrations in the blood, making it an effective buffer. \nSo, option B seems like a plausible answer.\nOption C is also relevant as the bicarbonate buffer system involves a weak acid (carbonic acid) and its conjugate base (bicarbonate), which is a characteristic of effective buffers.\nOption D, while true to some extent, doesn't directly address why the bicarbonate buffer system is ideal.\nConsidering the factors, the high concentration of bicarbonate in the blood plays a significant role in its effectiveness as a buffer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
