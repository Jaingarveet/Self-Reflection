Drugs that affect this outflow can help lower intraocular pressure in conditions like glaucoma. \nTimolol is a beta-blocker, which reduces aqueous humor production.\nPilocarpine is a miotic agent, which constricts the pupil and opens the trabecular meshwork, increasing outflow.\nBrimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, which reduces aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow.\nBrinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which reduces aqueous humor production. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
