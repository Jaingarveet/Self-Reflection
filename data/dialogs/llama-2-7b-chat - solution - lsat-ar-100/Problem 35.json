Here is my reflection on the problem and my previous solution:\n\nProblem:\nThe bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies - oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday), and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The conditions are:\n\n* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nMy previous answer:\nI selected option (A) - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n\nReasoning:\nI thought that since the bakery makes exactly three batches of each kind of cookie each week, and there are five days in a week, at least one batch of cookies must be made on each of the five days.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The bakery only makes three batches of cookies each week, and each batch is made on a single day. Therefore, the correct answer is option (B) - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n\nExplanation:\nThe bakery makes exactly three batches of cookies each week, and each batch is made on a single day. Since there are five days in a week, at least one batch of cookies must be made on each of the five days. However, since the bakery only makes three batches of cookies each week, at least two batches of cookies must be made on Wednesday. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer."
