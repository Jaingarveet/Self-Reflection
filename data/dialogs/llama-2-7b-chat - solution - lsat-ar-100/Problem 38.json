At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's re-analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf, so there can be at most one book on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf or the bottom shelf.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf or the middle shelf.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be on the bottom shelf.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of books on the middle shelf:\n\n[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the top shelf.\n[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]: This combination is possible only if G is placed on the bottom shelf.\n[REDACTED].
