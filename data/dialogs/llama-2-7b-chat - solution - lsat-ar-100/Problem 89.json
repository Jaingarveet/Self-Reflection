Here's my reflection:\n\nI incorrectly assumed that the bakery makes three batches of each cookie every week, which is not the case. According to the problem statement, exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday), which means that the bakery only makes a total of 3 x 3 = 9 batches of cookies per week.\n\nI also misunderstood the condition that states \"At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\" I thought this meant that at least one batch of each kind of cookie must be made on Monday, but in reality, it only means that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, regardless of the kind.\n\nNow, let's apply the correct reasoning to the question:\n\nIf the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can conclude that the bakery made exactly one batch of each kind of cookie (oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar) on Friday.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n\nExplanation:\nSince the bakery makes exactly three batches of each kind of cookie every week, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, it means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, and the third batch is made on Friday. Therefore, the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one."
