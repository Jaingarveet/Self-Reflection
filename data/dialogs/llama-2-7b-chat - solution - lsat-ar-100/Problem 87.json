To solve this problem, I need to follow the given requirements and constraints.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that the organizer must select at least five and at most six works from the group of nine works. We also know that the group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play.\n\nTo satisfy the requirements, we need to select at least three but no more than four novels. Since there are three French novels and three Russian novels, we can select at most two Russian novels. Therefore, the organizer must select at least one Russian novel and at most one French play.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) one Russian novel and one French play.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
