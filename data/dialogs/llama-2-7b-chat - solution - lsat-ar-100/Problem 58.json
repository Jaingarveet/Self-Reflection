Additionally, the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n\nBased on this information, I can eliminate options B and D as they do not meet the conditions given in the problem. Option B states that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, which is incorrect since the bay holding livestock has a lower number than the bay holding textiles. Option D states that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, which is also incorrect since the bay holding produce has a lower number than the bay holding fuel.\n\nTherefore, the only option that cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4 is option E, textiles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
