The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

I made an incorrect assumption that the order of the bays was important, but it is not specified in the problem.\n\nAction: I will re-evaluate the problem and use the information provided to determine the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: The answer is (C) four.\n\nExplanation: The information provided in the problem indicates that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, the bay holding produce is bay 4. Since the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding produce, the bay holding textiles is bay 5. Therefore, the type of cargo is completely determined for bays 4 and 5."
