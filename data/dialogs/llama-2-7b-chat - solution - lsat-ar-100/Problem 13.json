Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\nEither (A) Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday or (B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\n(A) Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday: This is impossible because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n\n(B) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday: This is also impossible because Hong does not testify on Monday, and Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Hong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
