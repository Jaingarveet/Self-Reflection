Here is my self-reflection:\n\n* I incorrectly assumed that K and G were placed on different shelves, when in fact they are placed on the same shelf.\n* I also mistakenly believed that L and F were placed on different shelves, when in fact they are placed on the same shelf.\n* I overlooked the fact that I is placed on the middle shelf, which affects the placement of other books on the shelves.\n\nTo correctly answer the question, I will use the information provided in the problem statement:\n\n* More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n* I is placed on the middle shelf.\n* K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n* O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n* F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n\nUsing this information, I can determine the correct placement of each book on the shelves:\n\n* Book F is placed on the bottom shelf.\n* Book G is placed on the middle shelf.\n* Book H is placed on the top shelf.\n* Book I is placed on the middle shelf.\n* Book K is placed on the bottom shelf.\n* Book L is placed on the top shelf.\n* Book M is placed on the middle shelf.\n* Book O is placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other."
