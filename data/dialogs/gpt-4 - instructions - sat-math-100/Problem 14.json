        "content": "Thought:\n1. The slope of the line can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. For example, between the points (3a, -a) and (5a, -2a), the slope is (-2a - (-a)) / (5a - 3a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.\n2. The y-intercept is the y-value when x = a, which is 0.\n3. The equation of the line in the form y = mx + b is y = -1/2x + 0.\n4. Rearranging the equation to the form of the answer choices gives 2x + y = 0.\n5. Expressing the equation in terms of 'a' by multiplying the entire equation by 'a' gives 2ax + ay = 0.\n6. None of the answer choices exactly match this equation, but if we substitute x = a, 3a, 5a and y = 0, -a, -2a respectively into each of the answer choices, we find that choice C: 2x - y = 5a is the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
