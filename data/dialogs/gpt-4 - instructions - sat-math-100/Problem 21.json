Here, a = 3, b = 12, and c = 6.\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a.\nSubstituting the values, we get x = [-12 ± sqrt((12)² - 4*3*6)] / 2*3.\nThis simplifies to x = [-12 ± sqrt(144 - 72)] / 6.\nFurther simplifying, we get x = [-12 ± sqrt(72)] / 6.\nSimplifying the square root, we get x = [-12 ± 6sqrt(2)] / 6.\nFinally, simplifying the entire expression, we get x = -2 ± sqrt(2).\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
