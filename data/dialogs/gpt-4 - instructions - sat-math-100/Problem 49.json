Since the denominators on both sides are the same, we can equate the numerators to solve for 'a'. \nThe equation becomes: 24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3 - 53\nSimplifying, we get: 24x^2 + 33x - 50 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The coefficient 'a' is 24, 'b' is 33, and 'c' is -50.\nThe value of 'a' in the quadratic equation is not the same as the 'a' we are asked to find in the question. The 'a' in the question is a constant that we are trying to solve for.\nThe quadratic equation does not help us find the value of 'a' in the question. Therefore, the question seems to be incorrect or missing some information.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
