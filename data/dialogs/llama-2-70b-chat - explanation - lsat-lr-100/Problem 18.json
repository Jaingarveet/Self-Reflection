        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.\n  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.\n  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.\n  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.\n  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED], \"[REDACTED]\"\n\nThis answer choice is similar to the reasoning in the original scenario, where Ed chooses between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], and chooses [REDACTED], which is more expensive. In choice [REDACTED], the rabbit is faced with two options, doubling back on the fox or fleeing for nearby cover, and chooses the former because the latter is not possible due to the lack of nearby cover.\n\nThe other answer choices do not use the same type of reasoning as the original scenario. Choice [REDACTED] states that Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties, which is the opposite of the reasoning in the original scenario. Choice [REDACTED] states that Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride, so she would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park, which is also different from the original scenario. Choice [REDACTED] states that Asteroid Y's orbit is more eccentric than asteroid X's because it's affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull, which has nothing to do with choosing between two equally desirable options. Choice [REDACTED] states that Miyoko will probably not enter this program because she has no desire to take a class in physics or art, which is not similar to the original scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], \"[REDACTED]\"\n"
