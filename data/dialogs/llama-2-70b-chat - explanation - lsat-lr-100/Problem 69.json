        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Some scientists have expressed reservations about quantum theory because of its counterintuitive consequences. But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. These results, which have not been equaled by quantum theory's competitors, warrant acceptance of quantum theory.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than do its competitors.\n  B: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.\n  C: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.\n  D: A theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it.\n  E: A theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.\n\nThe passage states that quantum theory has been rigorously tested and its predictions have been accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error, despite scientists' reservations about its counterintuitive consequences. This means that quantum theory has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it, and it has withstood all of them. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.\n"
