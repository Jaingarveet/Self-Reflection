        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.\n  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.\n  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.\n  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.\n  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the nature of Rossi's argument. I thought that Rossi's argument was based on the predictable consequences of a proposal, specifically the impact of governmental deficits on future generations. However, Rossi's argument actually appeals to a general principle of democracy, that people should have the right to vote and have their interests represented in government.\n"

Rossi's argument appeals to the principle of democracy, stating that children should have the right to vote since their interests are not always represented by their parents. This fits option A, \"It makes an appeal to a general principle.\" Therefore, the correct answer is A."
