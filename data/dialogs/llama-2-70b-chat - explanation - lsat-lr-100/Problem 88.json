In the 16 months since the enactment of legislation authorizing the campaign, vaccinations in our city have increased by 30 percent. Susan: But the major part of that increase occurred in the first 6 months after that legislation was enacted, right after your city's free neighborhood health clinics opened, and before the vaccination campaign really got going.\nQuestion: In responding to Yuriko, Susan does which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: She denies Yuriko's assumption that Susan's city wants to increase the vaccination rate for children.\n  B: She cites facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation.\n  C: She introduces evidence to show that the campaign Yuriko advocates is only effective for a short period to time.\n  D: She advances the claim that a campaign such as Yuriko recommends is not necessary because most parents already choose to have their children vaccinated.\n  E: She presents evidence to suggest that vaccination campaigns are usually ineffective.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nSusan is citing facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation by pointing out that the majority of the increase in vaccinations in Yuriko's city occurred before the vaccination campaign started. This is option [REDACTED], \"[REDACTED]\"\n"

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, \"She cites facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation.\""
