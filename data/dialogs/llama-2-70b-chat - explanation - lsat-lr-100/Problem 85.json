        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.\n  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.\n  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.\n  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.\n  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED], as it provides the most support for the president's prediction. The fact that the copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it, suggests that people who would otherwise copy the game will instead purchase it, leading to increased sales.\n\nOption [REDACTED] does not directly support the president's prediction, as the fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature and needs to recoup the cost does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.\n\nOption [REDACTED] does not provide support for the president's prediction, as the fact that Ditalgame's market share has shrunk does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.\n\nOption [REDACTED] does not provide support for the president's prediction, as even if Game Review Monthly gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, it does not mean that people who frequently copy games will purchase Ditalgame games instead of copying them.\n\nOption [REDACTED] does not provide support for the president's prediction, as the fact that Ditalgame games are copied more frequently than other games does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.\n"

The correct answer would be the option that provides the most direct and relevant support for this prediction.\n\nIt's important to note that the question is a logical reasoning question, and it's testing the ability to analyze information and draw logical conclusions.
