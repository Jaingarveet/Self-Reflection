So, if we are to maintain the quality of the education we provide, we must market our programs more aggressively. Without such marketing we will be unable to increase our enrollment.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the university president's argument can be properly drawn ifwhich one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides ifit increases its enrollment.\n  B: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it increases its enrollment.\n  C: The university will increase its enrollmentifit markets its programs more aggressively.\n  D: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.\n  E: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it markets its programs more aggressively.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nThe university president's argument concludes that the university must market its programs more aggressively to increase enrollment and maintain the quality of education. The correct assumption is that reducing spending next year would negatively impact the quality of education (choice D).\n\nThe other choices do not support the conclusion:\n\n* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would negatively impact the quality of education, which contradicts the president's argument.\n* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but the argument only establishes a link between marketing and enrollment, not between enrollment and spending reductions.\n* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that the university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively, but it does not address the impact of spending reductions on the quality of education.\n* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that marketing would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but, like choice [REDACTED], it does not follow from the argument's premises.\n"
