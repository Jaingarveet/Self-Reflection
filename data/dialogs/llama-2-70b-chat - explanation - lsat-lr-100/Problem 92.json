        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.\n  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.\n  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.\n  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe assumption required by the curator's argument is that the hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb. This assumption is necessary to support the curator's conclusion that the hippopotamus was a religious object, as the breaking of the legs is believed to have been done intentionally as part of a religious ritual. If the legs were broken off naturally, then the curator's conclusion would not be supported.\n\nThe other choices do not relate to the question or are not necessarily true. Choice [REDACTED], that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child, is not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument. Choice [REDACTED], that earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt, is also not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument. Choice [REDACTED], that the tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it, is not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument. Choice [REDACTED], that the hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb, is not necessarily true and does not affect the curator's argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], that the hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n"
