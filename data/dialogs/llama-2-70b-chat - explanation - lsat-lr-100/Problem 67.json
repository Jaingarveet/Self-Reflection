We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I.\nQuestion: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways?\nChoices:\n  A: It sets out a problem the argument as a whole is designed to resolve.\n  B: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.\n  C: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false.\n  D: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.\n  E: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nThe argument suggests that it is difficult or impossible to learn the lessons of history, and that even if we could discover what the lessons are, it is not clear that we could apply them to future situations. The argument is directed toward discrediting the idea that we can learn useful lessons from history, and therefore, the assumption that we should learn the lessons of history is not required to establish the argument's conclusion.\n"
