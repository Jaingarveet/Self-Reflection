Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nThe argument assumes that individuals cannot easily adopt the strategy of exaggerating the dangers of smoking unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning. This implies that people are not likely to deceive themselves into believing the exaggerated danger, and therefore, they need someone else to provide the warning.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not rely on the belief that people tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument focuses on the effectiveness of exaggerating the dangers of smoking, not the effectiveness of techniques that help people quit smoking in general.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the relationship between the extent of exaggeration and the likelihood of breaking a habit.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address whether a doctor is justified in deceiving a patient.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n"
