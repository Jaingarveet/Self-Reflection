        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In his book, published in 1892, Grey used the same metaphor that Jordan used in her book, which was published in 1885. The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.\n  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.\n  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n\nThis answer choice weakens the argument that Grey read Jordan's book because it suggests that the metaphor was not unique to Jordan's book and that both authors may have obtained it from the same source. This shared source could be the text published in 1860, which both Jordan and Grey may have read. Therefore, the fact that Grey uses the same metaphor as Jordan does not necessarily mean that he read her book.\n"
