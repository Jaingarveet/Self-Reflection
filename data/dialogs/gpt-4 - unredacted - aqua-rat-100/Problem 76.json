The correct simplification of the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) is x = n + 4, not x = n - 4. This led to an incorrect range for x.\nError Keywords:\n- Simplification error\n- Algebraic error\n- Range calculation error\nSolution:\nThe correct simplification of the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) is x = n + 4. \nSo, if 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then 40 ≤ x ≤ 76. \nHowever, none of the given options A, B, C, or D fully cover this range. \nThe closest option is D: 28 < x < 60, which partially covers the range of x.\nInstructions:\n1. Simplify the given expression correctly.\n2. Substitute the given range of n into the simplified expression to find the range of x.\n3. Compare the calculated range of x with the options given.\n4. Choose the option that best fits the calculated range of x.\nAdvice:\n- Always double-check your simplifications in algebraic expressions.\n- Be careful when calculating ranges based on inequalities.\n- Always verify your answer by substitifying the boundary values of the range into the simplified expression.\n- If none of the options fully cover the calculated range, choose the option that best fits the range.\n"
