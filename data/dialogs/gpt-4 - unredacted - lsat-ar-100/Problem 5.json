        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly interpreted the conditions of the problem. I focused on the placement of K, F, and M, but overlooked the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This led me to the wrong conclusion.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overlooking information\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nFrom the conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, and O is higher than L. F and M are on the same shelf. Since K is higher than F, and F is with M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the middle or top shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf can have at most 3 books. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf because if they were on the top shelf, K would have to be on the middle shelf, and there would be 4 books on the top shelf, which is not allowed. Since F and M are on the bottom shelf, and O is higher than L, O must be on a shelf higher than M.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions of the problem.\n2. Identify the relationships between the books.\n3. Determine the possible placements of each book based on the conditions.\n4. Consider all conditions when making conclusions.\n5. Double-check your reasoning and answer.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and conditions carefully.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Consider all conditions and information given in the problem.\n- Double-check your reasoning and answer.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n"
