        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy and the restaurant must be in spaces 7 and 1, respectively, which led me to conclude that the optometrist must be in space 6. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, not specifically which end. This led me to the incorrect conclusion that the optometrist is next to a restaurant.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Constraint misunderstanding\nSolution:\nGiven the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. If the shoe store is in space 4, the pharmacy cannot be in space 3 because it would not be at the end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 5 or 6. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the constraints of the problem.\n2. Identify the possible locations for each business based on the constraints.\n3. Determine the possible locations for the pharmacy and the restaurants.\n4. Determine the possible locations for the other businesses based on the constraints and the locations of the pharmacy and the restaurants.\n5. Identify the business that must be next to the pharmacy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your conclusion.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and the constraints carefully.\n- Understand the constraints and how they affect the possible locations of the businesses.\n- Use logical reasoning to determine the possible locations for each business.\n- Double-check your reasoning and your answer.\n- Remember that the constraints may not specify the exact locations of the businesses, but they limit the possible locations.\n"
