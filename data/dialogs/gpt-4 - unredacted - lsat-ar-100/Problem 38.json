        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the condition that O must be placed on a higher shelf than L. I placed O on the top shelf, but I should have placed it on the middle shelf, with L on the bottom shelf.\nError Keywords:\n- Overlooking conditions\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Arrangement error\nSolution:\nGiven that G is on the top shelf, and K must be on a higher shelf than F, K must also be on the top shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf and cannot be on the top shelf (because K is higher), they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and we already have two books (G and K) on the top shelf, F and M must be on the bottom shelf to allow for at least three books there. This leaves H, I, L, and O for the middle shelf. But since O must be on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the middle shelf with I, and L must be on the bottom shelf with F and M. This leaves H for the top shelf with G and K.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.\n2. Start by placing the books with the most restrictions.\n3. Remember that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n4. Remember that I is placed on the middle shelf.\n5. Remember that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n6. Remember that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n7. Remember that F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n8. Double-check your arrangement to ensure it meets all conditions.\n9. Choose the answer that matches your arrangement.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your arrangement and final answer.\n- Remember to consider all conditions when making your arrangement.\n"
