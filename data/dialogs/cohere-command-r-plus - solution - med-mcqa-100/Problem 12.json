This process ensures that the specific sequence of amino acids is assembled into a polypeptide chain based on the mRN[REDACTED] template. \n\n[REDACTED], lysine, and methionine are all standard amino acids that undergo this process and are, therefore, dependent on aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] for their incorporation into proteins. \n\nHowever, hydroxylysine is unique. It is not a canonical amino acid but a derivative of lysine formed through a post-translational modification. [REDACTED] is not directly incorporated into proteins during translation; instead, it is a product of enzymatic modification of specific lysine residues within the polypeptide chain after protein synthesis.\n"
