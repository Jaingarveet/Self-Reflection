        "content": "Thought: \nComedonal acne is a mild form of acne characterized by small, flesh-colored bumps called comedones, which are caused by clogged hair follicles and oil glands. The first-line treatment for comedonal acne typically includes topical retinoids, which are vitamin A derivatives that help unclog pores, normalize skin cell turnover, and reduce inflammation. While benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics can also be used in acne treatment, they are generally more effective for inflammatory types of acne lesions (like papules, pustules, or nodules) rather than comedonal acne. Estrogen can indeed improve acne in some cases, especially for those with hormonal imbalances, but it is not a first-line treatment and carries a different risk profile. Therefore, the best treatment option among these choices for comedonal acne is retinoids.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
