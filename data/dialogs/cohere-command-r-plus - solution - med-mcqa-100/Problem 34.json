When an individual is exposed to the allergen, IgE antibodies recognize it and bind to mast cells and basophils, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, which causes the typical symptoms of allergies, such as a runny nose, itchy eyes, and sneezing.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
