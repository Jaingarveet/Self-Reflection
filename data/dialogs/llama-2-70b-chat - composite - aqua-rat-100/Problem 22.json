During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the number of toys Jacob makes incorrectly.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Misunderstanding the question\n- Toy-making rate\nSolution:\nLet's assume the number of hours Alex works be x.\nSince both Alex and Jacob work for almost a similar number of hours, the number of hours Jacob works is also x.\n\nWe know that Alex makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.\nSimilarly, Jacob makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.\n\nSince both Alex and Jacob work for the same number of hours, the total number of toys they make is the sum of their individual toy-making rates:\n35/x + 35/x = 70/x\n\nNow, we want to find out how many toys Jacob makes. We can set up the following equation:\n70/x = 9(35)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 70/9\nx = 7.78\n\nSince Jacob works for 9 hours, the number of toys he makes is:\n35/x = 35/7.78 = 4.55\n\nSo, Jacob makes 4 toys less than Alex. Therefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Let the number of hours Alex works be x.\n3. Assume Jacob works for x hours as well.\n4. Calculate the toy-making rate for both Alex and Jacob.\n5. Calculate the total number of toys they make.\n6. Solve for x to find out how many toys Jacob makes.\n7. Calculate the number of toys Jacob makes.\n8. Compare the number of toys Jacob makes to Alex's number of toys.\n9. Choose the answer that matches your calculation.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.\n- In a problem involving rates, make sure to use the correct units for the rates.\n"
