What amount will he pay to clear the debt after 4 years\nChoices:\n  A: 750\n  B: 700\n  C: 620\n  D: 600\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula for simple interest and calculated the total amount instead of the simple interest.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Formula error\n* Calculation error\n* Simple interest error\n\nSolution:\nLet's recalculate the simple interest using the correct formula:\nSI = P x R x T\nSI = 500 x 6% x 4\nSI = [REDACTED]\n\nNow, the total amount that Rahul will pay is the sum of the principal amount and the simple interest.\nTotal = P + SI\nTotal = 500 + [REDACTED]\nTotal = 1100\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the formula for simple interest.\n2. Plug in the values for principal amount, interest rate, and time.\n3. Calculate the simple interest.\n4. Add the principal amount to the simple interest to get the total amount.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated total amount.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with formulas.\n* Make sure you understand the formula and how to apply it correctly.\n* Take your time and work step-by-step through the problem.\n* Don't let mistakes in previous questions affect your confidence in solving future questions.\n"
