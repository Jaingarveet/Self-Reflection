In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?\nChoices:\n  A: 21\n  B: 30\n  C: 31\n  D: 32\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I calculated the average of the monthly sales for the first 10 months of this year and last year, but I didn't consider the fact that the sales for last year were for 12 months, not 10. Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year should be calculated as follows:\n\nLet Y be the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year.\nThen, Y = 42/12 = 3.5\n\nThe average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period is:\n(X + Y)/2\n= (20 + 3.5)/2\n= [REDACTED]\n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Averages error\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the information given in the problem.\n2. Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the first 10 months of this year.\n3. Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year.\n4. Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the problem carefully and understand the information given.\n- Always calculate the averages correctly.\n- Always consider all the given information when making calculations.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that the average of two numbers is the result of adding them and dividing by 2.\n"
