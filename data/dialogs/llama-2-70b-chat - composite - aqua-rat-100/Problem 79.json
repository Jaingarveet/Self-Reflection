If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?\nChoices:\n  A: Rs 400\n  B: Rs 500\n  C: Rs 600\n  D: Rs 700\n  E: Rs 800\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the amount each daughter receives incorrectly. I apologize for my mistake.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the question\n* Calculation error\n* Incorrect answer\n\nSolution:\nLet's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.\nSince there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.\n\nEach daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.\n\nThere are 4 daughters, so the total amount they receive is 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 16x rupees.\n\nSince there are 5 sons, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.\n\nThe total amount the sons receive is 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x rupees.\n\nThe total amount available to divide is Rs 8600, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n16x + 25x = 8600\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n41x = 8600\n\nDividing both sides by 41, we get:\n\nx = 210\n\nSo, each daughter receives 4x = 4(210) = 840 rupees.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the answer is [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.\n3. Calculate the total amount the daughters receive.\n4. Calculate the total amount the sons receive.\n5. Set up an equation using the total amount available to divide.\n6. Simplify the equation and solve for x.\n7. Calculate the amount each daughter receives.\n8. Choose the correct answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.\n"
