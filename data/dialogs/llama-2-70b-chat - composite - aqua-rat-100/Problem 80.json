Let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners. The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees. The cost of W white sharpeners is W rupees, and the cost of B brown sharpeners is B rupees. Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:\nW + B = 100\n\nWe know that W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)\n\nSubstituting W + B = 18 into the first equation, we get:\nW + B = 100\nW = 100 - B\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for W into the first equation:\n100 - B + B = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n2B = 0\n\nSince B is a whole number, B = 0.\n\nNow, we can find W:\nW = 100 - B\nW = 100 - 0\nW = 100\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 0.\n\nInstructions:\n1.
