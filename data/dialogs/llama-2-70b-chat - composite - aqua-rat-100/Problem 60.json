I correctly identified that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], but I incorrectly concluded that the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Reasoning error\n* Misapplication of concept\n* Incorrect conclusion\n\nSolution:\nPoints [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150°. Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED]. Therefore, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the fact that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED].\n2. Recognize that the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED].\n3. Calculate the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by subtracting the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] from [REDACTED].\n4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully analyze the given information and identify the relevant facts.\n* Apply the concepts and formulas appropriately.\n* Double-check your calculations and conclusions.\n* Consider all the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options.\n* Practice similar problems to improve your problem-solving skills.\n"
