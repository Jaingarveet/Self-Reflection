If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\nChoices:\n  A: 8.75\n  B: 8.79\n  C: 8.75\n  D: 8.71\n  E: 8.72\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Radius error\n* Area error\n\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm.\n2. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters.\n3. The radius of each semi-circle is half the side length of the square, which is 10 cm.\n4. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius.\n5. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2(1/2)π(10cm)^2 = 20π cm^2.\n6. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the original square minus the total area of the two semi-circles.\n7. The area of the original square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.\n8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 20π = [REDACTED] cm^2.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the correct formula for the area of a semi-circle.\n2. Use the formula to calculate the area of each semi-circle.\n3. Calculate the total area of the two semi-circles.\n4. Calculate the area of the remaining paper by subtracting the total area of the semi-circles from the area of the original square.\n5. Simplify your answer to the nearest hundredth.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Make sure you are using the correct formulas and plugging in the correct values.\n* Take your time and work through each step carefully, especially when dealing with geometry and trigonometry problems.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help or seek additional resources if you're struggling with a concept or problem.\n"

I mistakenly subtracted 20π from 400 instead of adding 20π to 400. This resulted in an incorrect answer.\nI realized my mistake by double-checking my calculations and using the correct formula for the area of a semi-circle.\nI took my time to work through each step carefully, especially when dealing with geometry and trigonometry problems.\nI also sought additional resources to ensure my answer was correct.\nI learned the importance of accuracy and patience when solving math problems, especially when dealing with geometry and trigonometry.\nI will continue to practice and seek help when needed to improve my skills."
