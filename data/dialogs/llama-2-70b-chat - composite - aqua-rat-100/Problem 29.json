How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?\nChoices:\n  A: 25 days\n  B: 26 days\n  C: 27 days\n  D: 28 days\n  E: 29 days\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I divided 30 by 1, which is the net movement upward in one day, instead of dividing 30 by 3, which is the total movement upward in one day.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Division error\n* Misunderstanding of the problem\n\nSolution:\nThe frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down, so his total movement upward in one day is 3 + 2 = 5m.\nSince the frog is at the bottom of the well (30m), it will take 30 / 5 = 6 days to come out of the well.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Understand the problem and identify the relevant information.\n2. Calculate the total movement upward in one day.\n3. Divide the depth of the well by the total movement upward in one day to find the number of days it will take to come out of the well.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the problem carefully and understand the relevant information.\n* Be careful when performing calculations, especially when dividing.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Take your time and work step-by-step through the problem.\n* Consider drawing a diagram or creating a table to help you visualize the problem and keep track of the calculations.\n"
