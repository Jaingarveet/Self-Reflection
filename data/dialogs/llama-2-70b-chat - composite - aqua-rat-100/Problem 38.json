It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\nChoices:\n  A: 438\n  B: 550\n  C: 500\n  D: 450\n  E: 498\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation of the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted.\nI incorrectly calculated the number of faces as 6*5^2 - 1800, which equals [REDACTED].\nHowever, the correct calculation is 6*5^2 - 300*6 = [REDACTED].\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED], which is option [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Surface area error\n* Cubes error\n\nSolution:\n[REDACTED] hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm.\nThe surface area of the outer cube is 6*5^2 = 300 square centimeters.\nEach small cube has 6 faces, and each face has an area of 1^2 = 1 square centimeter.\nThe number of small cubes on the surface of the outer cube is 300/1 = 300.\nSince each small cube has 6 faces, the total number of faces on the surface of the outer cube is 300*6 = 1800.\nSince the outer surface of the cube is painted, all the faces of the small cubes on the surface are painted.\nThe number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted is 6*5^2 - 300*6 = [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Calculate the surface area of the outer cube.\n2. Calculate the number of small cubes on the surface of the outer cube.\n3. Calculate the total number of faces on the surface of the outer cube.\n4. Calculate the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the number of faces of a cube is 6, and the number of faces of a small cube is also 6.\n"
