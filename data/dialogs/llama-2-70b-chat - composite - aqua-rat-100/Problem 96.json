At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 months\n  B: 4 months\n  C: 23 months\n  D: 24 months\n  E: 84 months\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation of the time at which [REDACTED] joined the business.\nI incorrectly found the value of X to be [REDACTED].\nThe correct value of X is [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Algebraic error\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. [REDACTED] starts a business with Rs.40,000.\n2. After [REDACTED], [REDACTED] joins with Rs.60,000.\n3. [REDACTED] joins after some more time with Rs.120,000.\n4. The total investment now is Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.220,000.\n5. The total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.\n6. [REDACTED] gets Rs.150,000 as his share.\n\nNow, let's find the time at which [REDACTED] joined the business.\n\nProfit share of [REDACTED] = Total profit x (C's investment / Total investment)\n\nProfit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.375,000 x (Rs.120,000 / Rs.220,000)\n\nProfit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.375,000 x 0.545\n\nProfit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.199,750\n\nSince [REDACTED] gets Rs.150,000 as his share, the difference between the profit share of [REDACTED] and the actual amount he gets is:\n\nRs.199,750 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.49,750\n\nNow, we need to find the time at which [REDACTED] joined the business.\n\nLet X be the number of months after [REDACTED] joined that [REDACTED] joined.\n\nThe investment of [REDACTED] = Rs.120,000\n\nThe profit share of [REDACTED] = Rs.199,750\n\nThe difference between the profit share of [REDACTED] and the actual amount he gets = Rs.49,750\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\nRs.120,000 x (1 + (X/12))^X = Rs.199,750\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n1 + (X/12)^X = 1.66125\n\n(X/12)^X = 1.66125 - 1\n\n(X/12)^X = 0.66125\n\nX = 4\n\nTherefore, [REDACTED] joined the business [REDACTED] after [REDACTED] joined.\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\n---\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Be careful when simplifying algebraic expressions.\n"
