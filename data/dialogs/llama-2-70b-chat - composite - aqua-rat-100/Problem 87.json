Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket?\nChoices:\n  A: 45\n  B: 90\n  C: 120\n  D: 150\n  E: 180\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of permutation.\nI thought that the number of ways to choose 2 oranges was equal to the number of ways to choose the first orange multiplied by the number of ways to choose the second orange.\nHowever, this approach only works when the order of the oranges matters.\nIn this case, the order of the oranges does not matter, and we are counting the number of ways to choose 2 oranges without regard to order.\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which is the number of ways to choose 2 oranges without regard to order.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of permutation\n* Failure to recognize the concept of combinations\n* Incorrect application of the multiplication principle\n\nSolution:\nThere are 10 oranges in the basket, and we want to choose 2 oranges.\nWe can choose the first orange in 10 ways, and the second orange in 10 ways (since the order of the oranges does not matter).\nBy the combination formula, the total number of ways to choose 2 oranges is C(10, 2) = [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the total number of items (10 oranges).\n2. Identify the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges).\n3. Recognize that the order of the items does not matter.\n4. Apply the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! \\* (n-k)!)\n5. Plug in the values: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! \\* (10-2)!)\n6. Simplify the expression: C(10, 2) = [REDACTED]\n7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always understand the concept of permutation and combination.\n* Recognize when the order of items matters and when it does not.\n* Apply the correct formula to solve the problem.\n* Simplify the expression to obtain the final answer.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n"
