If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the pattern of the ages of the members in the club. I incorrectly assumed that the pattern was increasing by 3 months for each member, when in fact, the pattern was increasing by 3 years for each member.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the pattern\n* Incorrect assumption\n* Lack of attention to detail\n\nSolution:\nThe youngest member is 7 years old.\nThe common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 years, not 3 months.\nThe sum of the ages of all members is [REDACTED]0.\n\nNow, let's find the number of members in the club:\n\nThe first member's age is 7.\nThe second member's age is 10 (7 + 3).\nThe third member's age is 13 (10 + 3).\nThe fourth member's age is 16 (13 + 3).\nThe fifth member's age is 19 (16 + 3).\n\nWe can see a pattern here. Each member's age is 3 years older than the previous member's age.\n\nThe number of members in the club is the number of ages we have:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nTherefore, the number of members in the club is 5.\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the pattern of the ages of the members in the club.\n2. Pay attention to the details of the question, including the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression.\n3. Work step-by-step through the calculation of the ages of each member in the club.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Pay attention to the details of the question, including the common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression.\n* Work step-by-step through the calculation of the ages of each member in the club.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n* Be aware of potential pitfalls, such as misunderstanding the pattern of the ages of the members in the club.\n"
