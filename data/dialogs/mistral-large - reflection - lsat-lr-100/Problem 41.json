However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.\nQuestion: The argument is flawed in that it\nChoices:\n  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory\n  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences\n  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing\n  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true\n  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded\n\nThought:\nThe argument is flawed because it dismisses Riley's testimony solely based on her personal feud with the university president, without considering whether her claim has any merit.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
