We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I.\nQuestion: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways?\nChoices:\n  A: It sets out a problem the argument as a whole is designed to resolve.\n  B: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.\n  C: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false.\n  D: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.\n  E: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is about the difficulty of discovering the lessons of history and applying them to future situations. The statement \"that we should learn the lessons of history\" is presented as a common admonition, but the argument questions whether it is possible to do so.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
