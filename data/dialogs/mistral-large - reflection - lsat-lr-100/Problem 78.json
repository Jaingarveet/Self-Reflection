Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\n\nThought:\nThe argument assumes that most Acme employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes, as it states that once the company moves, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

Identify the main point of the argument.\n2. Determine what assumptions the argument is based on.\n3. Consider the information provided in the argument and what it implies.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not relevant to the argument or are not assumptions.\n5. Choose the answer that is a necessary assumption for the argument to be valid.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument being presented.\n - Always consider the implications of the information provided in the argument.\n - Always focus on the relevant information and ignore irrelevant details.\n - Always eliminate answer choices that are not assumptions or are not relevant to the argument.\n - Always choose the answer that is a necessary assumption for the argument to be valid."
