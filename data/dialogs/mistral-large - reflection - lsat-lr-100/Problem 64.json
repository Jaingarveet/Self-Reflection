Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears\n  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon\n  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon\n  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition\n\nThought:\nThe argument assumes that the reduction of emotional stress is caused by the shedding of tears, but it does not consider other possible factors that could contribute to the reduction of emotional stress.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
