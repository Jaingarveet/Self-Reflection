Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?\nChoices:\n  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.\n  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.\n\nThought:\nThe finding of the nicotine study is that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nThis suggests that smokers are adjusting their smoking behavior to maintain a certain level of nicotine in their blood.\nChoice B suggests that smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes, which could explain why the levels of nicotine in their blood are identical at the end of the day.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
