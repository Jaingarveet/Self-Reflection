Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\n\nThought:\nThe principle illustrated by the argument is that even if someone admits to engaging in illegal activities, it does not justify taking punitive measures against them if the evidence was obtained illegally.\nChoice A illustrates this principle, as Long is not justified in taking illegal action against Price despite his guilt.\nChoices B, C, and E are not relevant to the principle, as they involve different situations where the person taking action has also engaged in wrongdoing or where there is a history of pardoning similar behavior.\nChoice D is similar to the argument, but it involves trespassing rather than illegally obtaining evidence.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the principle illustrated by the argument. I thought that the principle was that illegal actions cannot be punished if the evidence was obtained illegally. However, the principle is actually that illegal actions cannot be punished if the evidence was obtained through illegal means by the person or entity seeking to punish the wrongdoer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstood principle\n* Misinterpreted argument\n* Misapplied principle\n\nSolution:\nThe principle illustrated by the argument is that illegal actions cannot be punished if the evidence was obtained through illegal means by the person or entity seeking to punish the wrongdoer.\n\nChoice A is not relevant to the principle because Long is taking illegal action against Price, not seeking to punish him.\n\nChoice B is not relevant to the principle because Shakila is not seeking to punish her secretary, and her past actions are not relevant to the current situation.\n\nChoice C is not relevant to the principle because Takashi's violation of the curfew is not related to the evidence against Sarah.\n\nChoice D illustrates the principle because the conservation officer obtained the evidence against Kuttner through illegal means (trespassing), and therefore cannot justifiably punish him.\n\nChoice E is not relevant to the principle because the board of directors is not seeking to punish Ramirez based on illegally obtained evidence.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Carefully read the argument and identify the principle illustrated by it.\n2. Compare each choice to the principle and eliminate any that are not relevant.\n3. Identify the choice that best illustrates the principle.\n4. Double-check that the choice is relevant to the principle and that it accurately reflects the situation described in the argument.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Carefully read and understand the argument before answering the question.\n* Identify the principle illustrated by the argument and apply it to each choice.\n* Eliminate choices that are not relevant to the principle.\n* Double-check that the chosen answer accurately reflects the principle and the situation described in the argument.\n* Be aware of subtle differences between choices and the principle illustrated by the argument."
