Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This principle is more general than the one I initially chose, which focused specifically on the use of property without permission.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the reasoning that needs to be justified.\n2. Consider the broader principles that could justify this reasoning, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.\n4. Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and identify the key issue.\n - Consider the broader principles that could apply to the situation, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.\n - Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.\n - Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.\n - Be aware of the potential for misinterpretation of the question and avoid making assumptions."
