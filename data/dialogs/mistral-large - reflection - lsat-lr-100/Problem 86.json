        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\n\nThought:\nThe information provided states that until 1985, the cabin air in planes was replenished once every 30 minutes, but since then, it has been replenished once every hour. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in planes has increased, making it easier for airborne illnesses to spread.\nThe answer that is most strongly supported by this information is that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

I focused on the increased risk of airborne illnesses due to higher levels of carbon dioxide, rather than the specific comparison between the levels of carbon dioxide in 1980 and today.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of information\n- Focusing on the wrong aspect of the information\n- Incorrect comparison\n\nSolution:\nThe information provided states that until 1985, the cabin air in planes was replenished once every 30 minutes, but since then, it has been replenished once every hour. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in planes has increased.\n\nThe question asks which statement is most strongly supported by this information. The correct answer is that in 1980, the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. This is because in 1980, the air was replenished more frequently, leading to lower levels of carbon dioxide.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to understand what it is asking.\n2. Identify the key information provided in the context.\n3. Consider how this information relates to each of the answer choices.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly supported by the information provided.\n5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information provided.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n- Focus on the specific information provided in the context.\n- Consider each answer choice in relation to the information provided.\n- Eliminate answer choices that are not directly supported by the information provided.\n- Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information provided, even if it is not the most obvious or intuitive choice."
