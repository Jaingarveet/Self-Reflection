Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\n\nThought:\nPatricia's argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.\nTo counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the squeaky floors were not necessarily for the purpose of detecting ninjas.\nChoice B is the strongest counter because it shows that even if the floors were squeaky, ninjas could still move around undetected, which weakens Tamara's argument that the floors were specifically designed to detect ninjas.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
