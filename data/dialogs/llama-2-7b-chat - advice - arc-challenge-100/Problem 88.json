When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations. Revising the hypothesis based on the results of the investigation is a crucial step in the scientific process.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, \"change the hypothesis to match the results.\" This involves carefully analyzing the data and considering alternative explanations to determine why the results do not match the hypothesis. By revising the hypothesis, Michelle can refine her investigation and obtain more accurate results.\n\n[REDACTED]"
