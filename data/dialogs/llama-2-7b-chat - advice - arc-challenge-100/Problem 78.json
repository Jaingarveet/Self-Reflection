However, upon further reflection, I realize that the skin is actually made up of tissues. The skin is composed of several layers of tissue, including the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Each layer has unique functions and structures that work together to provide protection, regulate temperature, and facilitate sensation. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) It is made of tissues.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
