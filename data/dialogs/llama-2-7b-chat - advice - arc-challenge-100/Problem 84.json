However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer. The addition of organic waste from fertilizers can actually lead to decreased oxygen levels in freshwater ecosystems.\n\nTo break down this problem, I will use the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the problem: The addition of organic waste from fertilizers can lead to increased nutrient levels in freshwater ecosystems, which can cause algae blooms and deplete oxygen levels.\n2. Understand the cause: The organic waste from fertilizers can lead to increased nutrient levels in the water, which can cause an overgrowth of algae. When the algae dies and decomposes, it consumes oxygen in the water, leading to decreased oxygen levels.\n3. Identify the correct answer: The addition of organic waste from fertilizers can lead to decreased oxygen levels in freshwater ecosystems.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Decreasing oxygen levels.\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of adding organic waste from fertilizers to freshwater ecosystems. While it may seem like a beneficial addition, it can have unintended negative effects on the ecosystem."
