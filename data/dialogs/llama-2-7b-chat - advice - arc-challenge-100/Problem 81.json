The Sun emits harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation and intense visible light, which can cause eye damage and other health problems if proper precautions are not taken.\n\nThe correct answer is option D, \"Look at the Sun only in the morning.\" This is because the Sun's rays are safer to observe during sunrise and sunset, when the sun's angle is lower in the sky and the UV radiation is less intense. Looking directly at the Sun during these times can still be dangerous, but it is safer than looking directly at the Sun during other times of the day.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nIn conclusion, when making observations of the Sun, it is essential to prioritize safety and take the necessary precautions to protect oneself from UV radiation and other potential hazards. Always use appropriate equipment and follow proper procedures to ensure a safe and successful observation."
