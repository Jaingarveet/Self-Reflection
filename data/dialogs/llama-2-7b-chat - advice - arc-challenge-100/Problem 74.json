I also realized that I did not use the correct terminology when classifying types of energy.\n\nFor this question, the correct answer is (C) thermal energy. Thermal energy is a type of potential energy that is associated with the motion of particles in a substance. It is the energy that is required to heat a substance, and it has the potential to do work when the substance expands or changes temperature.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
