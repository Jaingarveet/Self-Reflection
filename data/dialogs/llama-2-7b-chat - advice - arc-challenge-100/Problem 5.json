To solve this problem, I will break it down into simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n\nStep 1: Identify the given information:\nTen grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.\n\nStep 2: Determine the amount of sugar in the solution:\nThe amount of sugar in the solution is directly proportional to the amount of sugar dissolved in the water. Therefore, the amount of sugar in the solution is 10 grams.\n\nStep 3: Convert the amount of sugar from grams to a larger unit:\nTo convert the amount of sugar from grams to a larger unit, we can divide the amount of sugar in the solution by 100. Therefore, the amount of sugar in the solution is 100 grams.\n\nStep 4: Choose the correct answer:\nThe correct answer is (B) 100 g.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
