Upon reflection, I realized that a stopwatch is not necessary to determine the boiling point of a liquid. The correct tools for the job are a heat source (option B) and a thermometer (option D).\n\nTo determine the boiling point of a liquid, the student must use a heat source to heat the liquid and a thermometer to measure the temperature of the liquid as it reaches its boiling point. The stopwatch is not required as it is not a tool used to measure temperature or determine the boiling point of a liquid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D, a thermometer."
