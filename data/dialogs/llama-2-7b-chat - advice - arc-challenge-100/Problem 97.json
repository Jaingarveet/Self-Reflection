I misunderstood the question and overlooked the critical information that the formation of sedimentary rocks begins with the erosion of pre-existing rocks, which is the correct answer.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, I will break it down into smaller parts and use the keywords from the question to guide my answer. The first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is indeed erosion, which involves the removal of rocks and minerals from their original location through natural processes such as weathering, wind, water, or ice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) erosion.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
