While I correctly determined that \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter\", I failed to use that knowledge along with the sentence structures to infer the meaning of \"Doximayo\".\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Failure to synthesize information \n- Missed logical deduction\n- Incomplete problem solving\nSolution:\nGiven:\n1. \"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey\" means \"kidnapping student (host) hostage\"\n2. \"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs\" means \"hostage holding (see) reporter\" \n3. \"Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits\" means \"kidnapping reporters away\"\nFrom sentences 2 and 3, we can deduce that \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter(s)\".\nNow, looking at sentence 1, we see that \"Doximayo\" is in the same position as \"student\" in the translation. \nSince we know \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter(s)\", by process of elimination, \"Doximayo\" must mean \"student\".\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and analyze each piece of given information.\n2. Look for words that appear in multiple sentences and use their positions to deduce their meanings.\n3. Once you have determined the meaning of a word, use that knowledge to help deduce other word meanings.\n4. Use process of elimination based on sentence structure to determine the meanings of remaining words.\n5. Synthesize all of the information to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n6. Choose the answer choice that matches your deduction.\nAdvice:\n- Always fully utilize all of the given information when solving logic problems.\n- Look for patterns and similarities in the structure of the information provided.\n- If you can definitively determine the meaning of some elements, use that knowledge to deduce the meaning of other elements.\n- Employ process of elimination to systematically rule out incorrect possibilities.\n- Synthesize the information and patterns you have identified to reach a logical conclusion.\n- If you get stuck, methodically go through the problem-solving steps one-by-one.\n"

From sentences 2 and 3, we can deduce that \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter(s)\". \n\"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs\" means \"hostage holding (see) reporter\"\n\"Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits\" means \"kidnapping reporters away\"\nSince \"Mugbudengs\" appears in the same position as \"reporter(s)\" in both translations, it must mean \"reporter(s)\".\n2. Now let's look at sentence 1:\n\"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey\" means \"kidnapping student (host) hostage\"\nWe see that \"Doximayo\" is in the same position as \"student\" in the translation.\n3. Since we already know that \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter(s)\", by process of elimination, \"Doximayo\" must mean \"student\". There are no other nouns in that position in sentence 1 that it could be.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is B: \"Doximayo\" means \"student\".\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
