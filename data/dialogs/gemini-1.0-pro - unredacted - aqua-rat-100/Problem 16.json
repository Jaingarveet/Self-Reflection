What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?\nChoices:\n  A: 800\n  B: 720\n  C: 960\n  D: 1140\n  E: 1160\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Explanation:\nMy initial calculation was incorrect. I multiplied the map distance (20 inches) by the scale (10 miles/inch) but forgot to divide by 4, which represents the 1/4 inch increment on the map. This resulted in an overestimation of the actual distance.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Misinterpretation of scale\n* Multiplication error\n* Division error\n* Unit conversion error\n## Solution:\n1. Identify the map distance: 20 inches\n2. Identify the scale: 1/4 inch represents 10 miles\n3. Convert the map distance to miles: 20 inches * (10 miles / 1/4 inch) = 800 miles\n4. Simplify the expression: 800 miles\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully read the problem and identify the given information.\n2. Pay close attention to the units used in the problem.\n3. Convert all units to a consistent system before performing calculations.\n4. Accurately interpret the scale provided in the problem.\n5. Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring each step is correct.\n6. Double-check your calculations and final answer before submitting.\n## General Advice:\n* Be mindful of unit conversions and ensure consistency throughout the problem.\n* Visualize the problem and the scale to aid in understanding.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* Double-check your work and calculations to avoid errors.\n* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and problem-solving skills.\n"
