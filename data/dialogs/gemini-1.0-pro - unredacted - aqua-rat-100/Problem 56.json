This led to an underestimation of the actual interest rate.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the question and focused on the monthly payment instead of the total borrowed amount.\n* **Incorrect calculation:** I used the wrong base for calculating the interest, leading to an inaccurate result.\n* **Rounding error:** I might have rounded the interest rate prematurely, affecting the final answer.\n## Solution:\n1. **Calculate the total amount repaid:** 12 months * Rs.31.50/month = Rs.378\n2. **Calculate the total interest paid:** Rs.378 - Rs.360 = Rs.18\n3. **Calculate the interest rate:** (Rs.18 / Rs.360) * 100% = 5%\n## Instructions for future problems:\n1. **Read the question carefully:** Pay close attention to the details and identify the key information.\n2. **Identify the base for calculations:** Determine the correct base value for calculating percentages or ratios.\n3. **Perform calculations step-by-step:** Avoid mental math and write down each step to minimize errors.\n4. **Double-check calculations:** Verify your calculations before arriving at the final answer.\n5. **Consider alternative approaches:** Explore different methods to solve the problem and compare the results.\n## General advice for similar problems:\n* **Understand the underlying concepts:** Ensure a strong grasp of the mathematical concepts involved in the problem.\n* **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n* **Use estimation to check your answer:** Estimate the answer to get a sense of the magnitude and identify potential errors.\n* **Practice regularly:** Regularly solve problems to improve your problem-solving skills and accuracy.\n* **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze your errors and identify areas for improvement.\n"
