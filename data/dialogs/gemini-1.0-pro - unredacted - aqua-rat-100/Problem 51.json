If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?\nChoices:\n  A: 6\n  B: 7\n  C: 8\n  D: 9\n  E: 10\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that U is the midpoint of line segment RT instead of line segment ST. This led me to calculate the length of line segment RU incorrectly.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Misunderstanding\n- Midpoint error\nSolution:\nR, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST.\nThe lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively.\nSince U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST, which is 22/2 = 11.\nThe length of line segment RU is the difference between the lengths of line segments RT and SU, which is 17 - 11 = 6.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the points on the line and the midpoint of the line segment.\n2. Determine the lengths of the line segments.\n3. Calculate the length of the line segment that includes the midpoint.\n4. Determine the relationship between the midpoint and the desired line segment.\n5. Calculate the length of the desired line segment based on the relationship with the midpoint.\nAdvice:\n- Carefully read the problem and identify all given information.\n- Pay close attention to keywords like \"midpoint\" and \"difference.\"\n- Visualize the problem using a diagram or sketch.\n- Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n- Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.\n"
