        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices:\n  A: 10,8\n  B: 9,8\n  C: 7,8\n  D: 5,6\n  E: 11,12\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in interpreting the problem statement. I assumed that the cost of each white sharpener was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener, but the problem statement actually says that the cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. This led me to an incorrect equation and an impossible solution.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Logical error\nSolution:\nLet the cost of each brown sharpener be x rupees.\nThen the cost of each white sharpener is (x + 1) rupees.\nThe total cost of the white sharpeners is x * (x + 1).\nThe total cost of the brown sharpeners is (18 - x) * x.\nThe total cost of the sharpeners is rs. 100.\nSo, x * (x + 1) + (18 - x) * x = 100.\nSimplifying the equation, we get x^2 + 18x - 100 = 0.\nFactoring the equation, we get (x - 5)(x + 20) = 0.\nSolving for x, we get x = 5 or x = -20.\nSince the cost of a sharpener cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -20.\nTherefore, the cost of each brown sharpener is rs. 5.\nThe cost of each white sharpener is rs. 6.\nThe number of white sharpeners is 100 / 6 = 16.66, which we round down to 10.\nThe number of brown sharpeners is 18 - 10 = 8.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem statement carefully and identify the given information.\n2. Define variables to represent the unknowns.\n3. Write down the equations that relate the variables to the given information.\n4. Solve the equations to find the values of the variables.\n5. Check your solution to make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.\nAdvice:\n- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem statement.\n- Check your work carefully to avoid making careless mistakes.\n- If you get stuck, try to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n"
