What is the cost price of the article?\nChoices:\n  A: 270\n  B: 300\n  C: 280\n  D: 320\n  E: 315\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly calculated the cost price of the article. \nI knew the profit percentage and the selling price but made a calculation error.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Percentage error\n - Cost price error\nSolution:\nThe selling price of the article is Rs.360.\nThe profit percentage is 20%.\nThe cost price is the selling price divided by one plus the profit percentage.\nThe cost price is 360 / (1 + 20/100) = 360 / 1.2 = Rs.300.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the selling price of the article.\n2. Identify the profit percentage.\n3. Convert the profit percentage into a decimal.\n4. Calculate the cost price using the formula: cost price = selling price / (1 + profit percentage).\n5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the cost price is the selling price divided by one plus the profit percentage.\n"
