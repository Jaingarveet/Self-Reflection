However, I made a mistake in simplifying the final range of x. I incorrectly rounded the lower bound to 20 instead of 28.\nError Keywords:\n - Rounding error\n - Approximation error\n - Range calculation error\nSolution:\n1. Find the range of n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16.\n2. Find the range of n + 4√n + 4.\n3. Divide the range of the numerator by the range of the denominator.\n4. Simplify the resulting range.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated range.\nInstructions:\n1. When finding the range of an expression, consider all possible values of the variable within the given constraints.\n2. Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with inequalities.\n3. Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.\n4. Pay attention to rounding errors and ensure they do not significantly impact the final result.\nAdvice:\n - When solving problems involving inequalities, it's often helpful to visualize the ranges of the expressions involved.\n - Consider using graphical representations or tables to aid in understanding the relationships between variables.\n - Be mindful of the potential for rounding errors and their impact on the final answer.\n - Always strive for precision in your calculations and reasoning.\n"
