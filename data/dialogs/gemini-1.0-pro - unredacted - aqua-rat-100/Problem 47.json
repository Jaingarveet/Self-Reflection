Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?\nChoices:\n  A: M + N / 8\n  B: 2M + N / 8\n  C: M + N / 4\n  D: M + 3N / 8\n  E: M + N / 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly calculated the average speed by not considering the total distance traveled. \nI knew the correct formula for average speed but did not apply it correctly.\nError Keywords:\n - Miscalculation\n - Formula application error\n - Distance calculation error\nSolution:\nThe athlete runs M miles in 4 hours.\nThe athlete rides a bike N miles in 4 hours.\nThe total distance traveled is M + N miles.\nThe total time taken is 4 hours.\nThe average speed is (M + N) / 4 miles per hour.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the total distance traveled by adding the distances traveled in each activity.\n2. Identify the total time taken for both activities.\n3. Divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken to calculate the average speed.\n4. Express the average speed in miles per hour.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the correct formula or equation to solve the problem.\n - Always apply the formula or equation correctly to the given values.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.\n"
