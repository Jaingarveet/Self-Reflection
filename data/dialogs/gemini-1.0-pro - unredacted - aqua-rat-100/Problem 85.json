If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?\nChoices:\n  A: 1 step/minute\n  B: 2 step/minute\n  C: 3 step/minute\n  D: 4 step/minute\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial analysis was flawed. I focused on calculating the speed based on the individual scenarios (20 steps in 10 minutes and 10 steps in 20 minutes) without considering the overall context of the problem. This led me to conclude that there was a contradiction in the information provided.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation of problem context\n* Incomplete analysis\n* Failure to identify key information\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the key information:** The elevator takes 10 minutes to descend 20 steps and 20 minutes to descend 10 steps.\n2. **Calculate the consistent speed:** Since the speed should be constant regardless of the number of steps, we can focus on either scenario. \n    * Using the first scenario: Speed = Distance / Time = 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.\n3. **Choose the answer that matches the calculated speed:** The answer that matches the calculated speed of 2 steps/minute is A: 1 step/minute. \n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify all the key information provided.\n2. Analyze the problem holistically, considering all the scenarios and constraints.\n3. If there seems to be a contradiction, double-check your understanding of the problem and the information provided.\n4. Calculate the relevant values step-by-step, ensuring accuracy in each step.\n5. Choose the answer that aligns with your calculations and analysis.\n**General Advice:**\n* Pay close attention to the problem context and identify all the relevant information.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* Double-check your calculations and reasoning to avoid errors.\n* If unsure, consider alternative approaches or seek clarification.\n* Remember that consistency and accuracy are crucial in solving math problems.\n"
