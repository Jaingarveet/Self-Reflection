Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.\n2. Identify the researchers' views that need to be supported.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best supports the researchers' views.\n4. Choose the answer that provides the best support for the researchers' views.\n5.

However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will choose the one that seems most closely related to the researchers' view.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
