I realized that option A is not a logical inference because it implies a prerequisite that is not stated in the original statement. I also realized that option B is not a logical inference because it implies a different meaning than the original statement. I evaluated each option carefully and eliminated the ones that were not logical inferences. I chose option B as the answer that is not a logical inference."
