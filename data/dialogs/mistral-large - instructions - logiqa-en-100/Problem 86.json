Also, Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station and Haoyun Station, and is east of Haoyun Station.\n\nUsing this information, we can determine the order of the stations from west to east:\n\n* Haoyun Station is west of Fuyi Station, so it must be one of the first two stations.\n* Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, so it must be the third station.\n* Huyao Station is east of Fuyi Station, so it must be one of the last two stations.\n* Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and Yinling Station, and is east of Haoyun Station, so it must be the fourth station.\n* Yinling Station is adjacent to Jiushang Station, so it must be the fifth and final station.\n\nTherefore, the order of the stations from west to east is Haoyun, [REDACTED], Fuyi, Jiushang, Yinling.\n\nSince Fuyi is the third station and is east of Haoyun, it cannot be standing in the west. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B.\n\nSince Huyao is the fourth station and is east of Fuyi, it cannot be standing on the east side. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A.\n\nSince Yinling is the fifth and final station, it must be standing on the east side. Therefore, we can choose choice C.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
