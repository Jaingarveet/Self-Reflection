The question asks for a true statement that raises the most doubts about this argument.\n2. Broader context: The Amendment of China's Personal Income Tax Law raises the deduction standard for salary income from 800 yuan/month to 1500 yuan/month. No tax is required for monthly income less than 1500 yuan.\n3. Evaluation of options:\nA: True, but does not directly raise doubts about the official's argument.\nB: False, as a low personal income tax would not affect the honor of low-income earners as taxpayers.\nC: True and raises doubts about the official's argument, as personal income tax is meant to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor, not to give \"honor\" to taxpayers.\nD: True, but does not directly raise doubts about the official's argument.\n4. Choice: C\n5. Double-check: Option C is true and directly raises doubts about the official's argument by highlighting the actual purpose of personal income tax.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
