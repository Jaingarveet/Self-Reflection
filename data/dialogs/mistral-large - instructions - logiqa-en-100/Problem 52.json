Read the question and all available choices carefully.\n2. Identify the relationship between cost and profit.\n3. Consider how the employees' wages and the boss's profit are related to cost.\n4. Evaluate each choice in terms of how it relates to the relationship between cost and profit.\n5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the statement.\n"

The cost includes the wages of the employees, while the profit goes to the boss.\nThe statement does not provide any information about the ownership structure of the enterprise or the relative earnings of the boss and the employees.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nIf the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest. This conclusion is most strongly supported by the statement because it follows logically from the inverse relationship between cost and profit. If the employee does not have a stake in the enterprise's profit, they may be motivated to increase their wages, which would increase the cost and decrease the profit. This would create a conflict of interest with the boss, who wants to maximize profit. The other choices are not supported by the statement because they make assumptions about the ownership structure of the enterprise and the relative earnings of the boss and the employees, which are not mentioned in the statement."
