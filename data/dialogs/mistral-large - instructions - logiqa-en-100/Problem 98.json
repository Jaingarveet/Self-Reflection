Read the question stem carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the relationship between right and wrong and regulations in the argument.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine whether it supports or weakens the argument.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that contradict the argument or suggest that right and wrong are not separate from regulations.\n5. Choose the answer that supports the argument by suggesting that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.\n"

The argument suggests that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.\n\nI initially chose answer choice B because it suggests that failing to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven, which could be interpreted as supporting the argument that regulations are related to right and wrong. However, upon closer examination, this answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are always related to right and wrong, rather than acknowledging that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.\n\nAnswer choice A weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are necessary to judge right and wrong, rather than acknowledging that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.\n\nAnswer choice C weakens the argument by suggesting that regulations are always the basis for judging right and wrong, rather than acknowledging that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.\n\nAnswer choice D supports the argument by suggesting that the basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience, which is common and universal, but that the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place. This answer choice acknowledges that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
