Analyze the implications of the statement:\n    - Companies with dividends would not issue new stocks unless they need funds.\n3. Consider the question:\n    - Which of the following statements cannot be false?\n4. Evaluate each choice:\n    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends. This could be false if the company has dividends but needs financing.\n    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends. This cannot be false because the statement allows for companies without dividends to need financing.\n    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends. This could be false if the company has dividends and needs to issue new stocks.\n    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could be false if the company has other ways to finance, such as debt.\n"
