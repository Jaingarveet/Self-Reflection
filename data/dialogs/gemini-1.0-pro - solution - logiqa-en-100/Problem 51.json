F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is assigned to the sales department\n  B: H is assigned to the production department.\n  C: I was assigned to the sales department.\n  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. X and F are assigned to the same department (production).\n2. F must be allocated in the production department (already satisfied by step 1).\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department (not applicable in this case as X is not in sales).\n4. H and Y must be allocated in the same department. This condition is not affected by X and F being in production.\n5. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. This condition is also not affected by X and F being in production.\nBased on these conditions, let's re-analyze the choices:\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This could be true. G and F can be in different departments, and there is no restriction on G being in sales.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could also be true. H and Y can be in any department other than production (to satisfy condition 5), including the public relations department.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could be true as well. There is no restriction on I's department based on the given information.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could be true. Even though X and F are in production, condition 3 does not apply in this case, and W can be in any department, including public relations.\nTherefore, the statement that cannot be true is still:\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n"
