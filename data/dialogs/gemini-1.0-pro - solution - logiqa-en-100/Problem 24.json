        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:**\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I focused on the absolute numbers of deaths and life expectancy, rather than the **proportionality** of the data. I also failed to consider the specific context of the research institutes and universities in Zhongguancun.\n**Correct Answer:**\nThe correct answer is **C**. This option accurately points out the fallacy by drawing a parallel to a similar, absurd scenario. Just as surveying only college students would lead to a skewed and misleading conclusion about the average age of death for the entire population, focusing solely on the deaths of in-service personnel in a specific area (Zhongguancun) provides an inaccurate picture of the average life expectancy for intellectuals in general.\n**Key Insights:**\n* **Proportionality:** When analyzing data, it's crucial to consider the relative proportions rather than just absolute numbers.\n* **Context:** Understanding the specific context of the data is essential for drawing accurate conclusions.\n* **Avoiding misleading comparisons:** Drawing parallels to similar, absurd scenarios can effectively highlight the fallacy in reasoning.\n## Applying Insights to the Current Question\n**Analysis:**\nThe question asks about the fallacy in the statistical reasoning regarding the average age of death of intellectuals in Zhongguancun. Option C effectively exposes the flaw by comparing it to the illogical conclusion that college students have a significantly lower life expectancy than the general population. This analogy highlights the issue of drawing conclusions based on a limited and unrepresentative sample.\n**Action:**\nAnswer(\"C\")"
