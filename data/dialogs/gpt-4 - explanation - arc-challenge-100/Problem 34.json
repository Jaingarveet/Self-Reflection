After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?\nChoices:\n  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.\n  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.\n  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.\n  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the importance of independent verification in scientific research. While testing on human volunteers is a crucial step in drug development, it is not the most immediate way to strengthen the initial conclusions about the antibiotic's effectiveness. Independent verification through a separate lab can help eliminate bias and confirm the initial findings, thus strengthening the conclusions.\n"
