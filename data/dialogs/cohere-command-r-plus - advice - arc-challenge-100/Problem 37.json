While many bird species do have an instinct to build nests, it is not universal across all birds. Some birds, like the cuckoo, are brood parasites and do not build nests, instead laying their eggs in the nests of other bird species. Therefore, nest-building cannot be classified as an instinct present in all animals, and my answer should reflect this exception.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
