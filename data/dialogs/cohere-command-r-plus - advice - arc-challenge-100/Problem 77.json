        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Read the question and choices carefully to identify the specific changes predicted by each answer. \n - Understand the current ecological balance on the island and the factors influencing it. \n - Recognize that the introduction of a new predator will initially make all sheep more vulnerable, leading to a general decline in their population. \n - Avoid making assumptions about specific traits favored by the predator without explicit information. \n - Consider the law of small numbers: a decline in the majority population will be more noticeable at first.\n"

However, the recent introduction of a predator will impact both types of sheep. The population of both dark and light-wool sheep will decrease due to this new threat. As there are more sheep with light wool, a slight decline in their numbers will be more noticeable, and thus, a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool will likely be observed first.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
