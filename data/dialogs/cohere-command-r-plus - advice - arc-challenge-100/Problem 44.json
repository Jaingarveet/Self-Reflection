When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?\nChoices:\n  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.\n  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.\n  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.\n  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Understand the fundamental forces acting on an object: gravity, normal force, friction, etc.\n - Recognize how forces influence an object's motion: acceleration, deceleration, or constant speed.\n - Decompose complex forces into their components when necessary, especially with inclined planes.\n - Always consider all forces and their interactions, not just a single force in isolation.\n - Remember that speed changes occur when forces are imbalanced, and constant speed occurs when forces are balanced.\n"
