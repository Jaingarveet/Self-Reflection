Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.\n3. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not all tall.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\nA) Liu Dawei - Does not meet requirement 1, as he is not handsome.\nB) Li Qiang - Meets requirements 1 and 3, but does not meet requirement 2, as he is not a doctor.\nC) Wu Gang - Meets requirements 1 and 2, but does not meet requirement 3, as he is not tall.\nD) Wang Wei - Meets requirements 1, 2, and 4, but does not meet requirement 3, as he is not a doctor.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is (B) Li Qiang. He meets all the requirements specified by Li Na.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
