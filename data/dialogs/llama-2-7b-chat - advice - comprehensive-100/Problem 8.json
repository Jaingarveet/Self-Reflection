        "content": "  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. To solve this problem, I will use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two cars are moving relative to each other.\n\nSelf-reflection: I realized that I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it would take for the cars to meet based on the total distance of the highway instead of the relative distance between the cars. I also realized that I didn't take into account the fact that the cars are starting from opposite ends of the highway, which means they are moving in opposite directions.\n\nAction: To solve this problem, I will use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Relative Speed\n\nI know the distance of the highway is 50 miles, and I can find the relative speed of the cars by subtracting their speeds from each other:\n\nRelative Speed = 12 mph - 13 mph = -1 mph\n\nNow, I can plug in the values I know into the formula:\n\nTime = 50 miles / (-1 mph) = 50 miles / 1 = 50 hours\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 2 hours.\n\nAdvice: When solving problems, it's important to carefully read the question and understand the context. In this case, I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it would take for the cars to meet based on the total distance of the highway instead of the relative distance between the cars. Additionally, I didn't take into account the fact that the cars are starting from opposite ends of the highway, which is a crucial piece of information in solving the problem."
