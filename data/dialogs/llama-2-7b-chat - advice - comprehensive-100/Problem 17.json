Instead, the argument is actually trying to disprove the psychological theory that maintaining intimate relationships is necessary for happiness.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") - Loneliness is necessary for great painting artists.\n\nExplanation: The argument is using the example of great painters who spend most of their time in loneliness to disprove the psychological theory. If loneliness were necessary for great painting, then the argument would be valid. However, since great painters can be unhappy despite not having intimate relationships, the argument is untenable."
