I will follow the steps I should have taken to solve the problem correctly.\n\nStep 1: Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\nThe question states that the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches on a map, and that 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles.\n\nStep 2: Decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.\nI will break down the problem into two subproblems:\n\na. Convert the map distance (20 inches) to miles.\nb. Convert the actual distance (10 miles) to inches.\n\nStep 3: Think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n\na. Convert the map distance to miles:\nI will use the conversion ratio of 1/4 inch = 10 miles to convert the map distance of 20 inches to miles.\n\n20 inches / 1/4 inch = 80 miles\n\nb. Convert the actual distance to inches:\nI will use the conversion ratio of 10 miles = 80 inches to convert the actual distance of 10 miles to inches.\n\n10 miles x 80 inches/mile = 800 inches\n\nStep 4: Double-check my calculations and final answer.\nI have calculated the actual distance from Town F to Town G to be 800 inches.\n\nCorrect answer: E: 800 inches\n\nTherefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 800 inches."
