To solve this question, I will break it down into smaller parts and use the conditions provided to determine the possible days on which each student can give their report.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Additionally, we know that exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n\nOn Tuesday, the only day on which George can give a report, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that George must give his report in the morning.\n\nIf Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot give her report on Monday or Tuesday, as those are the only days on which Helen and Irving can give their reports. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible days on which each student can give their report:\n\n* George: Monday morning\n* Nina: Wednesday\n* Robert: Wednesday\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nAdvice: Always read the question carefully and understand the problem. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. Use the conditions provided to determine the possible days on which each student can give their report. Double-check your reasoning and calculations to ensure accuracy. Always choose the answer that corresponds to the correct day on which each student can give their report."
