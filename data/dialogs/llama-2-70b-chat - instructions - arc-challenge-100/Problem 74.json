Identify the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules: [REDACTED].\n4. Choose the answer that matches the correct type of energy: [REDACTED] - [REDACTED].\n\nAnswer: D\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, potential energy is energy stored in an object due to its position or state. Sound energy and radiant energy are types of kinetic energy. Thermal energy is the energy of motion of particles in a substance, it's also a type of kinetic energy. Chemical energy is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, it's a type of potential energy.\n2. The definition of potential energy is energy an object has due to its position or state. Chemical energy is the energy stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, it's a type of potential energy because it's energy that can be released when the bonds are broken or formed.\n3. The type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules is chemical energy.\n4. The answer that matches the correct type of energy is D: chemical energy.\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, I chose C: thermal energy. But thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy, not potential energy. Chemical energy is the type of energy that is stored in the bonds of atoms and molecules, and it's a type of potential energy. I realized my mistake and corrected it."
