Recognize that the mass of the astronaut is not affected by the location and remains constant.\n4. Calculate the weight of the astronaut on Earth by multiplying the weight on the Moon by 6.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated weight and mass of the astronaut.\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I answered this question incorrectly by mistake calculating the weight of the astronaut on Earth. I divided the mass of the astronaut by 6 instead of the weight.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\n1. Weight of the astronaut on the Moon = 31 pounds / 6 = 5.17 pounds\n2. Weight of the astronaut on the Moon in kilograms = 5.17 pounds x 0.453592 = 2.36 kilograms\n3. Mass of the astronaut on the Moon and Earth = 84 kilograms (since mass is constant and not affected by location)\n4. Weight of the astronaut on Earth = 2.36 kilograms x 6 = 14.16 pounds\n\nTherefore, the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on Earth are 14.16 pounds and 84 kilograms, respectively. The correct answer is option D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms."
