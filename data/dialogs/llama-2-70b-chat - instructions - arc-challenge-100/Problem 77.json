Evaluate the advantage of smaller size in escaping predators.\n4. Choose the answer that reflects the likely change in the sheep population.\n\nAnswer: B\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The relationship between the traits of the sheep and their ability to survive and breed is that larger, stronger sheep with dark wool have an advantage in terms of survival and breeding.\n2. The introduction of a new predator to the island will likely have a negative impact on the sheep population as a whole.\n3. Smaller sheep with light wool may have an advantage in escaping predators due to their smaller size and agility.\n4. Given the introduction of a new predator, the population of sheep with light wool is likely to increase as they are better able to escape predation. Therefore, the answer is B: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool.\n\nReflection:\n\nIn my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A, a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool. I realized that my mistake was due to not considering the effect of the new predator on the sheep population. I did not take into account that the introduction of a predator would likely lead to a decrease in the population of both dark and light wool sheep, with the smaller, lighter sheep having an advantage in escaping predation. Therefore, I have reevaluated my answer and chosen option B, a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool, as the correct answer."
