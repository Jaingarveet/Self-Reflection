A solid sample of aluminum has a definite shape, but a liquid sample of aluminum takes the shape of its container.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B, \"a definite volume.\" Both a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum have a definite volume, meaning they occupy a specific amount of space.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
