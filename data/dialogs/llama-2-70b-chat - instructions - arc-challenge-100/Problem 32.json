This is the most likely way for the students to generate a wave.\n\nOption C: Throwing a pebble into a pool of water can generate a wave by disturbing the equilibrium of the water molecules.\n\nOption D: Pulling on a coiled spring toy does not disturb the equilibrium of the spring or the surrounding air molecules, and therefore, it cannot generate a wave.\n\nI have re-evaluated each choice based on the criteria of disturbing the equilibrium of a medium, and I have selected option B as the best answer."
