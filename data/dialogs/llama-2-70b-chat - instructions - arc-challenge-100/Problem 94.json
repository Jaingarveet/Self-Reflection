Choose the answer that accurately reflects the concept of energy transformation during combustion.\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nPreviously, I selected answer choice A, \"The change in the wood is reversible,\" which is incorrect.\nThe change in the wood during combustion is not reversible because the chemical reaction involves the breakdown of the wood's cellular structure, which cannot be restored.\nThe correct answer is D, \"The energy in the wood is transformed.\"\nDuring combustion, the chemical energy stored in the wood is converted into heat and light energy, which cannot be reversed.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
