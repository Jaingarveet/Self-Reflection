Understand the concept of islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus.\nIslet cell transplantation is a procedure in which islet cells from a donor pancreas are transferred into a person with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The islet cells produce insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels.\n2. Identify the correct site of transplantation for islet cells.\nThe correct site of transplantation for islet cells is the liver. The liver provides a suitable environment for the islet cells to function properly, and it allows for easy access to the blood supply to deliver insulin to the body.\n3. Eliminate incorrect answer choices.\nA) Skin: Islet cells cannot be transplanted into the skin because it is not a suitable environment for their function.\nB) Injected into the portal vein: This is the correct answer. Islet cells are typically injected into the portal vein, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver.\nC) Liver: This is the correct site of transplantation for islet cells.\nD) Pelvis: Islet cells cannot be transplanted into the pelvis because it is not a suitable environment for their function.\n4. Choose the correct answer, \"[REDACTED]: Injected into the portal vein\".\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
