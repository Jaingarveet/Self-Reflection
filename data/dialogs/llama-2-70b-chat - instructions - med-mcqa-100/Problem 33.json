After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I needed to review the pathophysiology of cicatricial pemphigoid and understand the components of the basement membrane zone that are targeted by autoantibodies in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid. I recognized that collagen type XVII is the primary antigen targeted by autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid. In the salt split skin technique, IgG autoantibodies in the patient's serum will bind to collagen type XVII on the epidermal side of the split skin. Therefore, the correct answer is A: XVII collagen."
