After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of understanding of the condition being discussed. Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra in the spine slips out of place, either forward or backward. To diagnose this condition, imaging studies are essential.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is D: MRI. Although MRI is a valuable imaging tool for many musculoskeletal conditions, it is not the most useful investigation for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. The slippage of the vertebra can be best visualized on X-rays, either anteroposterior or lateral view. Therefore, options A and B are both useful investigations for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. CT scans can also be helpful in some cases, but they are not as sensitive as X-rays for detecting early slippage. MRI is not the most useful investigation for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis, as it may not visualize the slippage directly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: MRI."
