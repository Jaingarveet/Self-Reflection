However, upon further review, I realized that Levodopa actually works by increasing dopamine levels, not by decreasing cholinergic activity.\n\nThe correct answer is option C, Selegiline. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that selectively inhibits the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, leading to increased dopamine levels. Additionally, Selegiline has been shown to decrease brain cholinergic activity, which can help alleviate Parkinson's symptoms such as tremors and rigidity.\n\nI will make sure to carefully review the mechanism of action of each drug and pay close attention to the specific action of each drug to ensure that I select the correct answer this time.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
