Drug to treat such a case is:\nChoices:\n  A: Topical antibiotic\n  B: Benzoyl peroxide\n  C: Retinoids\n  D: Estrogen\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the type of acne the patient had. Comedonal acne is characterized by clogged pores and blackheads, and the best treatment is a topical retinoid. Retinoids are derived from vitamin A and help to unclog pores and prevent new comedones from forming.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is C: Retinoids. Retinoids are topical medications that are effective in treating comedonal acne by reducing comedone formation and helping to unclog pores. They are also useful in reducing fine lines and wrinkles, making them a popular choice for patients who want to improve the appearance of their skin.\n\nIt's important to note that topical antibiotics (choice A) are effective in treating acne by reducing the bacterial load on the skin, but they are not as effective in treating comedonal acne as retinoids. Benzoyl peroxide (choice B) is a common over-the-counter treatment for acne, but it can be drying and irritating to the skin, especially in patients with sensitive skin. Estrogen (choice D) is not a recommended treatment for acne, as it can worsen acne in some cases."
