Identify the facial artery and its origin.\n2. Identify the infraorbital artery and its origin.\n3. Understand the anastomosis between the facial artery and the infraorbital artery.\n4. Recall that the maxillary artery is a different branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the maxilla and other structures in the face.\n5. Double-check your answer by reviewing the anatomy of the blood vessels in the face.\n"

The facial artery originates from the external carotid artery.\n2. The infraorbital artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, which is also a branch of the external carotid artery.\n3. The facial artery and infraorbital artery anastomose (connect) with each other.\n4. The maxillary artery supplies blood to the maxilla and other structures in the face, but it is not involved in the anastomosis with the facial artery.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA. Opposite side of the facial artery: This choice is incorrect because the facial artery does not anastomose with itself.\n\nB. Transverse facial artery: This choice is incorrect because there is no such artery as the transverse facial artery.\n\nC. Anastomosis with Infraorbital artery: This choice is correct! The facial artery anastomoses with the infraorbital artery.\n\nD. Branch of the ophthalmic artery: This choice is incorrect because the ophthalmic artery is a different branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the eye and surrounding structures. It is not involved in the anastomosis with the facial artery.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
