Pr[REDACTED]tice identifying the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion given a description of a condition.\n\nAnswer: b) Type II hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nExplanation:\nSpring catarrh is an allergic condition that occurs in response to pollen exposure. It is a type II hypersensitivity reaction, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity. In this reaction, the immune system produces antibodies that bind to the surface of cells, leading to their destruction. In the case of spring catarrh, the antibodies target the pollen-sensitized cells in the nasal mucosa, leading to inflammation and the symptoms of the condition.\n\nType I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate reactions that occur within minutes to hours of exposure to an allergen. They are mediated by IgE antibodies and result in symptoms such as itching, hives, and difficulty breathing.\n\nType III hypersensitivity reactions are immune complex reactions that occur when antigens and antibodies combine to form immune complexes. These complexes deposit in tissues and activate the immune system, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.\n\nType IV hypersensitivity reactions are delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that occur within 24-48 hours of exposure to an allergen. They are mediated by T-cells and result in symptoms such as skin rashes and delayed reactions to drugs.\n\nType V hypersensitivity reactions are autoimmune reactions that occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. They are not associated with allergic reactions and do not play a role in spring catarrh.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is b) Type II hypersensitivity reaction."
