However, upon further review, I realized that the correct answer is option C: Fistula.\n\nCyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that aims to drain a pseudo pancreatic cyst by creating a connection between the cyst and the stomach. One of the major complications of this procedure is the formation of a fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin.\n\nA fistula can develop when the communication between the cyst and the stomach is not properly established or when there is a defect in the closure of the gastrostomy site. This can lead to a persistent leak of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis, sepsis, and other life-threatening complications.\n\nTherefore, option C: Fistula is the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
