After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I missed some key details in the chest X-ray image. I failed to recognize the reversed aortic arch, which is a characteristic of TGA.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe chest X-ray image shows a reversed aortic arch, which is a characteristic of TGA. The other choices, TOF, VSD, and TAPVC, do not match the image. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is TGA."
