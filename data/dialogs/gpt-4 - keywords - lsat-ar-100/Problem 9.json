Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of rules\n- Incorrect elimination of options\n"

Also, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be in a lower-numbered parking space. Given these rules, let's evaluate the options:\nA: Togowa is assigned parking space #1. This could be true as there is no rule that Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1.\nB: Young is assigned parking space #2. This cannot be true because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nC: Robertson is assigned parking space #3. This cannot be true because Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #4 (the only higher number than #3) because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\nD: Souza is assigned parking space #3. This cannot be true because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza and the only higher numbers than #3 are #4, #5, and #6. But Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza and Young cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6 because Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and Robertson can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nE: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4. This could be true as there is no rule that Vaughn cannot be assigned parking space #4.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
