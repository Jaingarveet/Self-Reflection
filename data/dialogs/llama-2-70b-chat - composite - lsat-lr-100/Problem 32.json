On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe editorial argues that the political party's policy is inconsistent because they have expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but have also claimed that the government should not increase spending on education.\n\nThe assumption behind this argument is that a consistent political policy should not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed. This is the best description of choice [REDACTED].\n\nThe other choices do not accurately describe the assumption made in the editorial:\n\n[REDACTED] is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the inconsistency of a legislator's actions.\n\n[REDACTED] is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the long-run effects of educational policy.\n\n[REDACTED] is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not suggest that the goal of increasing spending on education is not morally good.\n\n[REDACTED] is not relevant to the argument. The editorial does not discuss the views of members of other political parties.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
