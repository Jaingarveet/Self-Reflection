        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.\n  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nThe counselor argues that personal conflicts are not inevitable, and that people's irrationality is the primary cause of personal conflicts. They provide an example of how people tend to ascribe bad qualities to others more easily than good ones, even when there is more evidence of the latter.\n\nTherefore, option [REDACTED] accurately reflects the main conclusion of the argument, which is that personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect answer format\n* Did not state the answer in the form of \"Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")\"\n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the main conclusion of the argument.\n3. Choose the answer choice that accurately reflects the main conclusion.\n4. State your answer in the form of \"Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")\".\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument before answering.\n* Pay attention to the format of the answer and make sure to state it correctly.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it accurately reflects the main conclusion of the argument.\n"
