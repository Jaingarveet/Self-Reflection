We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.\n  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.\n  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.\n  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.\n  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe ethicist's argument concludes that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. The ethicist suggests that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. Therefore, choice [REDACTED], which states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn.\n\nThe other choices do not support the ethicist's argument. Choice [REDACTED] states that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed. Choice [REDACTED] states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This choice also does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.\n\nChoice [REDACTED] states that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. This choice suggests that our inclination to blame or praise someone for an action may depend on how much information we have, but it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.\n\nFinally, choice [REDACTED] states that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. While this may be true, it does not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

However, I can provide some guidance on how to approach the question.\nThe question asks which of the given choices enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn. The ethicist's argument concludes that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.\nTo answer the question, you need to identify the choice that supports the ethicist's argument. The ethicist suggests that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. Therefore, the correct choice should address this issue.\nAs mentioned in the explanation, choice [REDACTED] states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. This choice supports the ethicist's argument and is, therefore, the correct answer.\nThe other choices do not address the issue of whether we can be justified in praising or blaming someone for an action that we regard as freely performed. Choice [REDACTED] focuses on the responsibility of the person performing the action, while choice [REDACTED] addresses the issue of how much information we have about the action. Choice [REDACTED] states that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed, but this does not address the issue of justification for praising or blaming.\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED]."
