        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe professor's argument is based on the premise that thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas and make intellectual progress. The conclusion that freedom of thought is not a precondition for intellectual progress logically follows if we assume that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought. This is stated in choice [REDACTED], which is the correct answer.\n\nThe other choices do not support the professor's argument:\n\n* Choice [REDACTED] is not relevant to the professor's argument.\n* Choice [REDACTED] is not stated in the argument.\n* Choice [REDACTED] is the opposite of the professor's argument.\n* Choice [REDACTED] is not related to the professor's argument.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Assumption\n* Premise\n* Conclusion\n* Logical fallacy\n\nSolution:\n1. Identify the premise of the professor's argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion of the professor's argument.\n3. Identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.\n4. Choose the answer that states the assumption.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and understand the premise and conclusion.\n2. Identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.\n3. Choose the answer that states the assumption.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the argument carefully and understand the premise and conclusion.\n* Identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.\n* Choose the answer that states the assumption.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n* Remember that assumptions are not always explicitly stated in the argument.\n"
