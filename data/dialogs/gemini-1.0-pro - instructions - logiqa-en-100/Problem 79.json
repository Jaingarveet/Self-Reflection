Carefully read the argument and identify its main claim.\n2. Analyze each option to determine whether it supports, weakens, or is irrelevant to the argument.\n3. Be cautious of options that appear to support the argument but actually strengthen it.\n4. Consider the implications of each option in relation to the main claim of the argument.\n5.

I mistakenly chose option C, which actually supports the argument by claiming that mirages are real, thus strengthening the argument for the existence of an external world.\nThis time, I will carefully analyze each option and consider its implications in relation to the main claim of the argument.\nAnalysis:\nA: This option points out a circularity in the argument, as it uses sensory evidence to prove the existence of the external world, but sensory evidence itself relies on the existence of the external world. This weakens the argument.\nB: This option questions the reliability of the argument's claim that others have similar visual experiences. This weakens the argument.\nC: This option supports the argument by claiming that mirages are real, thus strengthening the argument for the existence of an external world.\nD: This option questions the validity of natural science knowledge if there is no external world. This weakens the argument.\nConclusion:\nOption A most clearly constitutes doubt or rebuttal to the argument by pointing out a circularity in its reasoning.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
