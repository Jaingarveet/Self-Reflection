At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the arguments presented by both Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang.\n2. Identify the specific claim that Xiao Wang is refuting.\n3. Analyze Xiao Wang's argument to determine the method used to refute Xiao Chen's claim.\n4. Consider the broader context of the argument and the overall purpose of Xiao Wang's response.\n5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the method used by Xiao Wang to refute Xiao Chen's views.\n"

I focused too much on the specific claim that Xiao Wang was refuting, rather than on the method used to refute it.\nIn order to answer this question correctly, I need to:\n1. Carefully read and understand the arguments presented by both Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang.\n2. Identify the specific claim that Xiao Wang is refuting.\n3. Analyze Xiao Wang's argument to determine the method used to refute Xiao Chen's claim.\n4. Consider the broader context of the argument and the overall purpose of Xiao Wang's response.\n5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the method used by Xiao Wang to refute Xiao Chen's views.\nFollowing these steps, I can now answer the question correctly.\nThought:\nXiao Chen argues that the flickering light emitted by Comet 1996D3 is an unusual phenomenon, as comets are not typically observed to emit light when they are far from the sun.\nXiao Wang refutes this claim by pointing out that people do not typically observe comets far from the sun. This suggests that the lack of previous observations of flickering light from comets far from the sun is not evidence that such a phenomenon is unusual.\nTherefore, Xiao Wang's method of refutation is to disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
