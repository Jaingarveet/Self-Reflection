        "content": "Action: Answer(\"A\")\n**Explanation:**\nThe argument in the context is:\n> All people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese.\n> Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China.\n> Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.\nThis is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The argument assumes that if the antecedent (\"being under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China\") is false, then the consequent (\"being Chinese\") must also be false. However, this is not necessarily the case. There could be other factors that determine whether someone is Chinese, even if they are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China.\nThe answer choice that most closely resembles this fallacy is:\n> All successful people have to eat in clothes.\n> I am not a successful person now, so I do n’t have to eat in clothes.\nThis argument also assumes that if the antecedent (\"being a successful person\") is false, then the consequent (\"eating in clothes\") must also be false. However, this is not necessarily the case. There could be other reasons why someone might choose to eat in clothes, even if they are not a successful person.\nThe other answer choices do not commit the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n* **Choice B:** This is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n* **Choice C:** This is an example of the fallacy of affirming the antecedent.\n* **Choice D:** This is a valid argument.\n"
