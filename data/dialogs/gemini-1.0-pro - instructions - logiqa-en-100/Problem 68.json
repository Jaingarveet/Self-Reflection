I focused too much on the explicit statements in the argument and did not think about what was not explicitly stated.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to identify the unstated assumption that is necessary for the argument to be valid.\nThe conclusion of the argument is that whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life.\nThe premises of the argument are:\n* If a person only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people's things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught.\n* Stealing things from others is not the best for someone who can still live for 20 years, because he will suffer the fear of being caught.\nThe premises do not support the conclusion because they only talk about the consequences of stealing for people with different lifespans. They do not say anything about whether people with different lifespans are more or less likely to steal.\nThe unstated assumption that is necessary for the argument to be valid is that people with shorter lifespans are more likely to steal than people with longer lifespans.\nThis assumption is not supported by any evidence, so the argument is not valid.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
