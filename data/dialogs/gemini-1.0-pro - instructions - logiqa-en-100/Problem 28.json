I focused on the first two conditions and did not realize that the third condition implied that G must participate if J participates. This led me to choose the wrong answer.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read and understand all conditions, including any negations or implications. I will also break down complex conditions into simpler components and analyze each choice systematically against all conditions. Finally, I will double-check my reasoning and interpretation of the conditions before choosing an answer.\nNow, let's analyze the choices:\nA: F and H: This choice violates the first condition because both F and H are selected.\nB: G and J: This choice satisfies all conditions. If J participates, then G must participate according to the third condition. Also, the first and second conditions are satisfied because only one of J or K participates and only one of E or F participates (in this case, J).\nC: G and M: This choice violates the fourth condition because F does not participate and M participates.\nD: H and M: This choice violates the first condition because both E and M are selected.\nTherefore, the only choice that satisfies all conditions is B: G and J.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
