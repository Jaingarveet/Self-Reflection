The question is asking which of the following can most question the view that online shopping allows people to satisfy their pursuit of material life without leaving home. I initially chose option B, which states that people could still buy their favorite products through physical stores even without the internet. However, this option does not directly question the view that online shopping allows people to satisfy their pursuit of material life without leaving home. It simply states that there was an alternative way to purchase goods before the internet.\nThe correct answer is option C, which states that the display of goods on the internet cannot fully reflect the real situation. This option directly questions the view that online shopping allows people to satisfy their pursuit of material life without leaving home because it suggests that people may not be able to get a complete picture of the product they are buying online. This could lead to dissatisfaction with the purchase, which would contradict the view that online shopping allows people to satisfy their pursuit of material life without leaving home.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
