The reason is that the bridge hinders the passage of giant ships. To raise doubts about this point of view, we need to find an option that contradicts or raises doubts about the given statement. \nOption A states that a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge. This option supports the expert's point of view and does not contradict it. \nOption B states that 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed. This option also supports the expert's point of view and does not contradict it. \nOption C states that it is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge. The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters. This option does not contradict the expert's point of view, but it raises doubts about the feasibility of demolishing and rebuilding only the Nanjing Bridge. \nOption D states that shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. This option contradicts the expert's point of view that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
