If she does not clarify, the public will believe the rumors, and if she clarifies, it will attract more attention and make the news spread faster. Therefore, the best strategy is not always to clarify. Option A is not necessarily true because the statement does not provide enough information to support it. Option B is false because gossip news can damage a celebrity's reputation. Option C is not necessarily true because the best strategy depends on the situation. Option D is not mentioned in the stem and is therefore not relevant.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
