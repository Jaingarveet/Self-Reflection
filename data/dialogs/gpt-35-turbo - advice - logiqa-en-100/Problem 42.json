To refute this argument, we need to find an answer choice that contradicts this claim. \nChoice A is irrelevant to the argument.\nChoice B is a possible alternative explanation for the findings, but it does not necessarily refute the argument.\nChoice C is also irrelevant to the argument.\nChoice D, if true, would contradict the argument by suggesting that the cave was inaccessible for human habitation for the past 5000 years.\nTherefore, the best answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
