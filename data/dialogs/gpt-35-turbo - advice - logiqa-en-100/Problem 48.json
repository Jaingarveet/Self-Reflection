To find the best argument against this, we need to look for an option that provides an alternative explanation or counterargument that directly addresses this claim.\nOption A is not a good argument because it does not provide an alternative explanation or counterargument to the claim.\nOption C is not a good argument because it talks about real estate speculators in Beijing and Shanghai, which is not directly related to the claim about Chinese buyers in the US real estate market.\nOption D is a good argument because it provides an alternative explanation for why Chinese buyers are investing in the US real estate market, which is that the US real estate market has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation. This argument suggests that Chinese buyers are not necessarily transferring their property abroad because they are rich, but because they see the US real estate market as a good investment opportunity.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
