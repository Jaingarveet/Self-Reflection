(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in front Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: Which of the following lists are acceptable arrangements for the second team's performance?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? H Middle? P After? K\n  B: Before? H Middle? L After? N\n  C: Before? G In? Q After? P\n  D: Before? G In? Q After?
