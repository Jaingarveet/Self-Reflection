However, the statement actually means that a company with a dividend does not need to issue new stocks for financing.\nI also ignored the information that \"For listed companies, only companies with dividends can issue new stocks.\" This information is crucial because it establishes a direct relationship between having a dividend and issuing new stocks.\nFinally, I made an incorrect assumption that a company with a dividend cannot need financing.
