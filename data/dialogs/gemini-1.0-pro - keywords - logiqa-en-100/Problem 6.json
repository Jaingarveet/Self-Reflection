This led me to choose the incorrect answer.\nTo avoid this mistake in the future, I will pay closer attention to the conditions and ensure that I consider all possible scenarios before making a decision.\nHere's my analysis of the question:\n1. Since the team didn't go to I Peak, they cannot visit Lake J according to condition (4).\n2. Condition (1) states that at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited. However, since Lake J is not an option, the team must have visited Lake G.\n3. Condition (2) states that if the team doesn't visit E city or F city, they cannot visit Lake G. Since the team visited Lake G, they must have visited either E city or F city.\n4. Condition (3) states that if the team doesn't visit E city, they cannot visit H mountain. This condition doesn't provide any information about F city.\nTherefore, the only conclusion we can draw is that the team must have visited Lake G and either E city or F city. We cannot determine whether they visited both E city and F city or just one of them.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
