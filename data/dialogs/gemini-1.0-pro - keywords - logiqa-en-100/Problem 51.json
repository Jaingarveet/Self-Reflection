X and F are assigned to the same department. Based on condition (4), this department must be the production department.\n2. Since F is in production, G cannot be in the same department due to condition (2). Therefore, G must be either in sales or public relations.\n3. If G is in sales, then W must be in production according to condition (3). However, we already established that F and X are in production, leaving no room for W. Therefore, G cannot be in sales.\n4. G must be in public relations. This leaves H and Y to be allocated to either production or sales.\n5. Option A: G is assigned to the sales department - This is not possible as we established G is in public relations.\n6. Option B: H is assigned to the production department - This is possible. H and Y can be allocated to either production or sales as long as they are together.\n7. Option C: I was assigned to the sales department - This is possible. I can be allocated to any department as long as H and Y are together and G is in public relations.\n8. Option D: W is assigned to the public relations department - This is not possible. W must be in production if X is in sales, but we already established that X and F are in production.\nTherefore, the statement that cannot be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
