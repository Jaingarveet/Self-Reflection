I thought the question was asking for the minimum number of common members between the two groups, but it is actually asking for the maximum number of common members.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider the conditions given in the context and the fact that the printing group has only three members.\nCondition (2) states that F and K cannot be in the same group. Since the printing group has only three members, and G, H, and L are already in the printing group, neither F nor K can be in the printing group.\nCondition (3) states that if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Since K is not in the printing group, J must also not be in the printing group.\nCondition (4) states that M is at least one of the members of these two groups. Since M is not in the printing group, M must be in the binding group.\nCondition (5) states that at least one of the same employees in both groups. Since M is in the binding group, and M is not in the printing group, there are no common members between the two groups.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the binding group and the printing group have no common members.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
