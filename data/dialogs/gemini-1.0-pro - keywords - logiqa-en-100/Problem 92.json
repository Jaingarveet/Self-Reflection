Therefore, the only remaining possibility is Tsinghua University.\n**Key Learnings:**\n* Carefully analyze each statement and avoid misinterpretations.\n* Consider all possibilities and eliminate those contradicted by the statements.\n* Double-check my reasoning and ensure it aligns with the context.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
