Then, I need to evaluate each answer choice to see if it constitutes a doubt or rebuttal to those claims.\n**Correct Answer:** A\n**Explanation:** Choice A points out that the argument relies on circular reasoning. It assumes the existence of the external world to explain the existence of the external world. This is a valid doubt or rebuttal to the argument.\n**Other Choices:**\n* B: This is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument. It simply raises a question about the nature of other people's experiences.\n* C: This is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument. It simply makes a claim about the nature of mirages.\n* D: This is not a doubt or rebuttal to the argument. It simply points out the success of natural science.\n## Applying Self-Reflection to Current Question\n**Analysis of Argument:**\nThe argument claims that the existence of the external world is supported by the following evidence:\n* Sensory experience (e.g., seeing buildings, crowds, and stars)\n* The existence of other people with similar visual experiences\n* Book knowledge\n**Evaluation of Answer Choices:**\n* A: This is a doubt or rebuttal because it points out a flaw in the argument's reasoning.\n* B: This is not a doubt or rebuttal because it simply raises a question about the nature of other people's experiences.\n* C: This is not a doubt or rebuttal because it simply makes a claim about the nature of mirages.\n* D: This is not a doubt or rebuttal because it simply points out the success of natural science.\n## Conclusion\nThe correct answer is A.\n## Action\nAnswer(\"A\")"
