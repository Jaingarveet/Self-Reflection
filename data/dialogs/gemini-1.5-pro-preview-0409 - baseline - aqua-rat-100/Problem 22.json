To find the total time, we divide the total toys by their combined rate: 35 toys / (16/63 toys/hour) = 137.81 hours.\n3. **Jacob's Time:** Since they worked similar hours, Jacob worked approximately half of the total time: 137.81 hours / 2 = 68.9 hours.\n4. **Jacob's Toys:** To find how many toys Jacob made, we multiply his time by his rate: 68.9 hours * (1/9 toys/hour) = 7.65 toys.\n5. **Rounding:** Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round to the nearest whole number. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
