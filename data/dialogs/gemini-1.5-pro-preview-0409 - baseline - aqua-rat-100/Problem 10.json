Speed is distance over time, so 700 meters / 40 seconds = 17.5 meters per second.\nNext, we know it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, which means the length of the space shuttle is the distance it travels in those 5 seconds.\nTherefore, the length is 17.5 meters/second * 5 seconds = 87.5 meters. \nSince 87.5 is not an option, we choose the closest value, which is 75 meters.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
