Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the end result (frost) and overlooked the intermediate phase change. While I correctly identified condensation as the process responsible for frost formation, I failed to recognize that the water vapor first needs to undergo sublimation before it can condense directly into ice crystals.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Incomplete understanding of phase transitions\n* Overlooking intermediate steps\n* Focusing solely on the end result\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the initial state of water:** Water vapor in the air.\n2. **Recognize the temperature condition:** Cold surface in winter.\n3. **Recall the phase transition sequence:**\n    * Sublimation: Water vapor directly transforms into ice crystals without passing through the liquid phase.\n    * Condensation: Water vapor transforms into liquid water.\n4. **Apply the appropriate phase transition:** Since the water vapor directly transforms into ice crystals, sublimation is the relevant process.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. Carefully analyze the initial and final states of the substance involved.\n2. Consider all possible phase transitions between the initial and final states.\n3. Identify the specific conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure) that favor a particular phase transition.\n4. Choose the answer that aligns with the identified phase transition and the given conditions.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* **Visualize the process:** Draw diagrams or use mental imagery to visualize the phase transitions involved.\n* **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n* **Consult reliable sources:** Refer to textbooks, scientific articles, or online resources to confirm your understanding of phase transitions.\n* **Practice with diverse examples:** Solve problems involving different substances and conditions to solidify your knowledge.\nBy following these steps and incorporating the general advice, I can improve my accuracy in answering questions related to phase transitions and other scientific phenomena. \n"
