However, she will be facing the opposite direction because she is running in a circle.\nError Keywords:\n- Directional reasoning error\n- Circular path error\n- Half-lap misconception\nSolution:\nMargaret is running a full lap around a circular track.\nShe is facing north when she starts.\nAfter completing half of a lap, she will have traveled 180 degrees around the circle.\nTherefore, she will be facing the opposite direction, which is south.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the starting direction of the runner.\n2. Determine the angle of rotation for half a lap (180 degrees).\n3. Apply the angle of rotation to the starting direction to find the final direction.\n4. Consider the circular nature of the path and the implications for direction changes.\n5. Choose the answer that corresponds to the calculated final direction.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the geometry of the problem, especially when dealing with circular paths.\n- Remember that angles and directions are relative concepts, and their values can change depending on the starting point and the direction of movement.\n- Visualize the runner's path and the corresponding changes in direction.\n- Be mindful of common misconceptions about circular motion and direction changes."
