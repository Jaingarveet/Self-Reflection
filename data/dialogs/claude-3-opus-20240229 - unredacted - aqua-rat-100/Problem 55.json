However, I selected the wrong multiple choice option. The correct answer was listed as both choice B and choice E, but I only selected B and failed to notice that E was also correct.\nError Keywords:\n - Inattention to detail\n - Incomplete answer checking\n - Duplicate correct answer\nSolution:\n1. Let the speed of the current be x kmph.\n2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.\n3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.\n4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed\n   2 = 4 - x\n   x = 4 - 2 = 2\n   So, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.\n5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed \n                             = 4 + 2 = 6\nTherefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.\nBoth choice B and choice E are 6 kmph, so either B or E is correct.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.\n2. Assign variables to unknown quantities.\n3. Set up equations based on the relationships described in the problem.\n4. Solve the equations step-by-step to find the unknown quantities.\n5. Use the solved quantities to calculate the final answer.\n6. Carefully review all the answer choices.\n7. Select all answer choices that match the calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question and answer choices thoroughly. \n - Be aware that there may be multiple correct answer choices.\n - Solve the problem first, then compare your answer to all choices.\n - Select an answer only after checking it matches your solution.\n - If multiple choices match your answer, select them all.\n - Don't assume there is only one right answer without checking.\n"
