        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown in the evening.\n  B: L is shown in the afternoon.\n  C: L is shown in the evening.\n  D: M is shown in the morning.\n  E: M is shown in the afternoon.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I misinterpreted the rule regarding the showing order of houses L and M. I focused on L being shown after K but overlooked the requirement that L must also be shown before M. This led me to consider only the relative order of K and L, neglecting the constraint imposed by M. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Neglect of constraints\n\nSolution: \nThe given rules and constraints are as follows: \n- J must be shown in the evening. \n- K cannot be shown in the morning. \n- L must be shown after K and before M. \n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the following: \n- J is shown in the evening, which is the only option for its showing time. \n- K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. \n- L must be shown after K, which narrows down its options to the afternoon or evening. \n- M must be shown after L. As L can only be shown in the afternoon or evening, this means that M can only be shown in the evening (after L) or afternoon (if L is shown in the evening). \n\nNow, let's consider the options: \n- A: K is shown in the evening. This is not a must; K can be shown in the afternoon, depending on the showing time of J. \n- B: L is shown in the afternoon. This must be true because L has to be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning. If K is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown afterward in the same time slot. \n- C: L is shown in the evening. This is not a must as L can also be shown in the afternoon, maintaining the relative order with K. \n- D: M is shown in the morning. This cannot be true because M can only be shown after L, and L cannot be shown in the morning due to the constraint on K. \n- E: M is shown in the afternoon. This is not a must as M can also be shown in the evening, depending on when L is shown. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: L is shown in the afternoon. \n\nInstructions: \n- Identify the given rules and constraints regarding the showing order of the houses. \n- Interpret the rules accurately, paying close attention to the specific requirements for each house. \n- Consider all the options for the showing times of J, K, and L, as they are interconnected. \n- Deduce the possible showing times for M based on the constraints imposed by L. \n- Evaluate each choice carefully, considering the must-be-true condition. \n\nAdvice: \n- Read and understand the rules and constraints carefully. \n- Break down complex rules into simpler components to facilitate understanding. \n- Consider the implications of each rule and how they interact with each other. \n- Create a logical framework that accounts for all the rules and their implications. \n- Avoid making rushed conclusions; thoroughly evaluate all options before selecting an answer. \n- Double-check your interpretation of the rules to ensure accuracy.\n"

As K cannot be shown in the morning, it will be shown in the afternoon or evening. This means that L, which must follow K, will be shown in the afternoon at the earliest, thus also satisfying the condition that M can only be shown after L. \n\nTherefore, L must be shown in the afternoon for all possible combinations of showing times for J, K, and M, making this statement a must-be-true conclusion.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
