        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I misinterpreted the conditions and made assumptions that led me to an incorrect conclusion. I overlooked the condition that Hong could not testify on Monday, which meant that Hong had to testify on Tuesday, leaving Wednesday as the only option for Franco. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Assumption\n\nSolution: Given that Jackson testifies on Monday and Hong cannot testify on Monday, Hong must testify on Tuesday. With two witnesses testifying on Tuesday, and Franco and Garcia not testifying on the same day, it must be the case that Franco and Garcia testify on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. This leaves Monday with Jackson and Wednesday with Iturbe and Franco. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions: Jackson testifies on Monday, exactly two witnesses on Tuesday, Franco and Garcia don't testify together, Iturbe on Wednesday, and Hong not on Monday.\n2. Start with the condition that has the least flexible options; Jackson testifies on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday. \n3. Build the schedule from there: Tuesday has two witnesses, so it could be Franco and Garcia, or Franco and Hong, or Garcia and Hong. \n4. Apply the remaining conditions: Franco and Garcia cannot testify together, so they must testify on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. \n5. Finalize the schedule: Monday - Jackson, Tuesday - Hong and Garcia, Wednesday - Iturbe and Franco. \n\nAdvice:\n- Carefully read and understand all the conditions provided in the question. \n- Identify the most restrictive conditions first, as they limit the options for the subsequent steps. \n- Build the schedule step-by-step, ensuring each condition is met. \n- Double-check the final schedule to ensure all conditions are satisfied. \n- Avoid making assumptions; always rely on the provided conditions and logical deductions.\n"
