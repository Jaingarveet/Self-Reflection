From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \\%$ and the population of City $\\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \\%$. If the population of City $\\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 60,000\n  B: 90,000\n  C: 160,000\n  D: 240,000\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and wrote equation (1) as X + Y = 120,000, which is not correct. The correct equation would be X = Y + 20,000, since the population of City X increased by 20% and the population of City Y decreased by 10%.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question\n* Incorrect equation\n* Calculation error\n\nSolution:\nLet's call the population of City X \"X\" and the population of City Y \"Y\".\nWe know that X = Y + 20,000 (since the population of City X increased by 20%)\nWe also know that X + Y = 120,000 (since the populations are equal)\nX = Y + 20,000 ... (1)\nX + Y = 120,000 ... (2)\nSubtracting (1) from (2), we get:\nY = 100,000\n\nNow we can find the population of City Y in 2010:\nY = 100,000 - 10% of 100,000\nY = 100,000 - 10,000\nY = [REDACTED]\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.

Therefore, the population of City X in 2015 is:\n\nX = 120,000 + (20% of 120,000)\nX = 120,000 + 24,000\nX = 144,000\n\nSince the populations of City X and City Y were equal in 2015, the population of City Y in 2015 is also 144,000.\n\nNow, we need to find the population of City Y in 2010. We know that the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015, so we can calculate the population of City Y in 2010 as follows:\n\nY = 144,000 - (10% of 144,000)\nY = 144,000 - 14,400\nY = 130,600\n\nTherefore, the population of City Y in 2010 was 130,600. The correct answer is B: 90,000.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous answer, I misunderstood the question and wrote the equation X + Y = 120,000, which is not correct. The correct equation would be X = Y + 20,000, since the population of City X increased by 20% and the population of City Y decreased by 10%.
