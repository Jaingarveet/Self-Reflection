This contradicts the psychological theory that maintaining intimate relationships is necessary for happiness. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Loneliness\n* Necessary condition\n* Artistic success\n* Intimate relationships\n* Happiness\n\nSolution:\n\n1.

Eliminate answer choices that are not related to the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.\n4. Choose the answer choice that best summarizes the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the main point.\n2. Identify the psychological theory mentioned in the argument.\n3. Recognize the contradiction between the psychological theory and the fact that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness.\n4.
