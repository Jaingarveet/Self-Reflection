The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?\nChoices:\n  A: Mean\n  B: Median\n  C: Range\n  D: They will all change by the same amount.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the concept of \"range\" in statistics and how it would be affected by removing the outlier. \nError Keywords:\n- Conceptual misunderstanding\n- [REDACTED] calculation\nSolution:\nThe table provides lengths of 21 brown bullhead fish, including an outlier of 24 inches. \nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. \nIf we remove the outlier of 24 inches, the range will change the most. \nThe maximum value will decrease from 24 to 16, resulting in a significant change in the range. \nInstructions:\n1. Understand the concept of range in statistics and how it is calculated. \n2. Identify the maximum and minimum values in the data set. \n3. Calculate the original range by subtracting the minimum from the maximum. \n4. Identify the outlier value to be removed. \n5. Calculate the new maximum value after removing the outlier. \n6. Calculate the new range using the updated maximum and the original minimum. \n7. Compare the changes in the mean, median, and range due to the removal of the outlier. \n8. Choose the answer that corresponds to the statistic with the greatest change. \nAdvice:\n - Ensure you understand the basic statistical concepts, such as mean, median, and range, before attempting the problem. \n - Carefully read and interpret the data provided in the table. \n - Identify outliers and understand their potential impact on the data. \n - Practice calculating the range correctly by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values. \n - Consider the potential effects of removing outliers on each statistic and compare these effects to determine the greatest change.\n"
