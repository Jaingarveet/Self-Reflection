        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 15\n  C: 20\n  D: 22\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly set up the equation to solve for the percentage change in the width. \nI should have compared the areas of the original and altered rectangles to account for the [REDACTED]% decrease in area. \nInstead, I incorrectly equated the altered area to 88% of the original area, leading to an incorrect value for $p$.\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Percentage error\n- Equation setup error\n\nSolution:\nLet $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the rectangle.\nThe original area of the rectangle is $LW$.\nAfter altering the rectangle, the new length is $1.1L$, and the new width is $(1-p/100)W$.\nThe new area of the rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.\nWe are given that this alteration results in a [REDACTED]% decrease in the area, so $A' = 0.88 \\times LW$.\n\nNow, we set up the equation:\n$$0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$$0.88 = 1.1(1-p/100)$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100:\n$$88 = 110 - 110p/100$$\n\nIsolating $p$:\n$$-110p/100 = -[REDACTED]$$\n$$p = [REDACTED]$$\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and the variable to be determined ($p$).\n2. Define variables: Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.\n3. Calculate the original area: The area of the rectangle is $LW$.\n4. Calculate the altered area: After changing the length and width, the new area is $(1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.\n5. Set up the equation: The altered area is [REDACTED]% less than the original area, so set up the equation $0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$.\n6. Simplify the equation: Simplify the equation to isolate $p$.\n7. Solve for $p$: Calculate the value of $p$ by isolating it in the equation.\n8. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches the calculated value of $p$.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the variable to be solved.\n- Define clear variables to represent the unknown values.\n- Use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the variables.\n- Simplify equations step-by-step to avoid errors.\n- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context.\n- Be cautious when dealing with percentages, and ensure you apply them correctly.\n"
