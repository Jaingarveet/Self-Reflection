If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?\nChoices:\n  A: $x+2 y=a$\n  B: $x+2 y=5 a$\n  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$\n  D: $2 x-y=7 a$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Data interpretation error\n- Algebra error\n- Assumption error\n\nSolution:\n\nThe table shows that as x increases by 3a, y decreases by a. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. \n\nThe equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: \n\n$2x - 3y = 0 \\times 5a$. \n\nMultiplying by 5a gives: \n\n$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \\times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \\times a$, or $x + 2y = a$. \n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Examine the table and identify the pattern: as x increases by 3a, y decreases by 1a. \n2. Recognize this as a linear relationship with a negative slope. \n3. Find the y-intercept by identifying the value of y when x=a. \n4. Express the relationship as an equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. \n5. Rearrange the equation to make x the subject, and then multiply by the appropriate value of a to match the options. \n\nAdvice:\n\n- Always examine the data carefully and identify patterns or relationships. \n- Avoid making assumptions; work with the data as it is presented. \n- When dealing with linear relationships, focus on the slope and y-intercept. \n- Practice rearranging equations and identifying equivalent expressions. \n- Double-check your work by substituting values from the table into your equation.\n"
