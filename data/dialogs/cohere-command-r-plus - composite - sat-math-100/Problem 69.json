        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\n  B: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\n  C: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\n  D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the relationship between the number of gallons, the number of miles, and the cost. \nI incorrectly assumed that the number of gallons reduced was directly related to the cost savings, without considering the impact on the total number of miles driven. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Algebraic error\n - Unit conversion error\nSolution:\n - Alan currently drives $100$ miles per week and wants to save $\\$5$ on gasoline. \n - Gasoline costs $\\$4$ per gallon, and his car's mileage is $25$ miles per gallon. \n - To determine how many fewer miles he should drive, we need to find the number of miles represented by $\\$5$ worth of gasoline at the given rate. \n - $\\$5$ worth of gasoline at $\\$4$ per gallon is $5/4 = 1.25$ gallons. \n - This amount of gasoline, at a rate of $25$ miles per gallon, will allow him to drive $1.25 * 25 = 31.25$ miles. \n - So, the equation representing this relationship is $\\frac{25}{4}m = 31.25$, where $m$ is the number of fewer miles driven. \n - Simplifying the equation, we get $\\frac{25}{4}m = \\frac{5}{4} * 12.5 = 5$, which is choice $D$.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the given information: Alan's average weekly mileage, car's mileage, desired savings, and gasoline cost.\n2. Identify the relationships: Number of gallons to the number of miles and cost to the number of gallons.\n3. Calculate the number of gallons represented by the desired savings: $\\$5$ savings at $\\$4$ per gallon.\n4. Determine the number of miles represented by the calculated gallons: Use the car's mileage rate.\n5. Set up the equation: Express the relationship between the number of fewer miles ($m$) and the desired savings.\n6. Simplify the equation: Ensure it matches the format of the choices and your calculations.\n7. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that aligns with your simplified equation.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the units and their conversions. \n - Clearly define the relationships between the variables and their units. \n - Double-check your calculations and unit conversions. \n - Ensure you understand the underlying relationships before forming equations. \n - Simplify equations step-by-step to avoid errors.\n"
