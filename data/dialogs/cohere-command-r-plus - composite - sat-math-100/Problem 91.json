Which of the following defines $f$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $f(n)=n-3$\n  B: $f(n)=2 n-4$\n  C: $f(n)=3 n-5$\n  D: $f(n)=4 n-6$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Insufficient data\n- Linear equation identification\n- Single-point evaluation\n\nSolution: To find the equation of a linear function, we typically use the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can calculate the slope using any two points from the table:\n\n$m=\\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\\frac{1+2}{-2}=3$\n\nNow, we can use the y-intercept, which is given as $f(0)$, to find $b$:\n\n$b=f(0)=3$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the linear function is $f(n)=3n+3$, which matches option [REDACTED]: $f(n)=3n-5$. \n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n1. Understand that a linear function forms a straight line when graphed.\n2. Recognize that a single point may not uniquely define a linear function.\n3. Calculate the slope of the line using any two distinct points from the table.\n4. Determine the y-intercept by evaluating $f(0)$.\n5. Use the calculated slope and y-intercept to write the equation in slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$.\n6. Compare the calculated equation with the provided options to find the correct match. \n\nAdvice:\n- Always consider the unique characteristics of linear functions when dealing with such problems.\n- Remember that a linear function is defined by its slope and y-intercept.\n- Understand that the slope of a line can be calculated using any two distinct points on the line.\n- Avoid relying on a single data point to make conclusions about linear functions.\n- Always double-check your calculations and the final equation.\n"
