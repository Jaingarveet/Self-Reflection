However, my mistake was in not recognizing that $[REDACTED]b$ should be simplified to $[REDACTED]a$ before proceeding with the calculation. This incorrect assumption led me to choose answer option [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic simplification error\n- Cancellation error\n- Assumption error\n\nSolution:\nGiven $\\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$, we can rewrite this as $a = [REDACTED]b$. Now, we substitute this expression into the fraction:\n$\\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \\frac{[REDACTED]a}{a} = \\frac{[REDACTED] \\cdot [REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \\frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]} = C$\n\nInstructions:\n[REDACTED]. Identify the given information: $\\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$.\n[REDACTED]. Rewrite $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = [REDACTED]b$.\n3. Substitute this expression into the fraction: $\\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b}$.\n[REDACTED]. Simplify the fraction: $\\frac{[REDACTED]a}{a}$.\n5. Further simplify by substituting $a = [REDACTED]b$: $\\frac{[REDACTED] \\cdot [REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b}$.\n6. Calculate the value: $\\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \\frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}$, which matches choice [REDACTED].\n\nAdvice:\n- Always simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.\n- Be cautious when canceling out factors; ensure you're not eliminating information that should be used in subsequent steps.\n- Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that fractions can be simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n"
