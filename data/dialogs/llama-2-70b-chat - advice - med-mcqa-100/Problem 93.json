Let's evaluate the options:\n\nA: Topical antibiotic - This would treat bacterial infections, not comedonal acne.\nB: Benzoyl peroxide - This is effective in treating comedonal acne by reducing P. acnes bacteria and inflammation.\nC: Retinoids - Derivatives of vitamin A, they prevent comedone formation by promoting cell turnover and unclogging pores.\nD: Estrogen - Hormonal imbalances can cause acne, but estrogen won't treat comedonal acne directly.\n\nReflecting on my previous mistake, I realize that I should have considered the root cause of comedonal acne and matched it with the appropriate treatment. Benzoyl peroxide and retinoids are both effective treatments for this type of acne.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - Benzoyl peroxide."
