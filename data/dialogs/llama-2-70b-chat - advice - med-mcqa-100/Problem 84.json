It does not affect the trabecular meshwork or aqueous outflow.\n\nB: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agent that increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. It works by increasing the activity of the ciliary muscles, which helps to open the trabecular meshwork and improve aqueous outflow.\n\nC: Brimonidine is an alpha-agonist that reduces aqueous humor production and increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork. It works by decreasing the production of aqueous humor and increasing the activity of the ciliary muscles, which helps to open the trabecular meshwork and improve aqueous outflow.\n\nD: Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces aqueous humor production. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork or aqueous outflow directly.\n\nBased on the specific mechanism of action of each medication and its effect on the aqueous outflow, the correct answer is (B) Pilocarpine. Pilocarpine increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by increasing the activity of the ciliary muscles, which helps to open the trabecular meshwork.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
