It is not caused by Ca+2 efflux in cells, fat deposition in cells, or water imbibition in cells.\n\nThe correct answer is D: Enzymatic digestion. Necrosis is a form of cell death that occurs when cells are damaged beyond repair, leading to the release of cellular contents, including enzymes that can digest the cell from within.\n\nI will make sure to review the basics of pathology, including the differences between necrosis and apoptosis, and pay closer attention to key words and phrases in the question to ensure accuracy in my answers. I will also seek out additional resources to clarify any misunderstandings.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
