        "content": "  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's review the key features of each disease:\n\nA. RPGN (Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis): RPGN is a type of glomerulonephritis that progresses rapidly, usually over weeks to months. It is characterized by the presence of crescent-shaped deposits in the glomeruli, which are formed by the accumulation of immune complexes or antibodies. The glomeruli are also enlarged and have an irregular shape.\n\nB. Acute GN (Acute Glomerulonephritis): Acute GN is a type of glomerulonephritis that develops suddenly, usually in response to an infection or injury. It is characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells in the glomeruli, which cause swelling and bleeding. The glomeruli may also have a \"coffin lid\" shape.\n\nC. Membranous GN (Membranous Glomerulonephritis): Membranous GN is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and the presence of immune complexes or lipid deposits in the glomeruli. The glomeruli are also enlarged and have a \"spiky\" appearance.\n\nD. Membranoproliferative GN (Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis): Membranoproliferative GN is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by the proliferation of the glomerular epithelial cells, leading to the formation of new membranes and the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. The glomeruli may also have a \"lobulated\" appearance.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is A. RPGN. RPGN is the only disease that shows crescent-shaped deposits under a light microscope.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
