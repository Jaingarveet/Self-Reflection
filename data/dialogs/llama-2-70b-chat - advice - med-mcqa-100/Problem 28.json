I misunderstood the question and answered it incorrectly.\nHere's my reflection on the question:\nThe site of transplantation in Islet cell transplant for Diabetes mellitus is not Skin, injected into the portal vein, or Pelvis.\nIslet cell transplantation involves transplanting healthy islet cells from a donor pancreas into a person with type 1 diabetes.\nThe transplantation site should be able to support the survival and function of the islet cells and allow for efficient glucose sensing and insulin secretion.\nThe liver is a suitable site for islet cell transplantation because it is a vascular organ with a large blood supply, which provides the necessary oxygen and nutrients for the islet cells to function properly.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Liver.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
