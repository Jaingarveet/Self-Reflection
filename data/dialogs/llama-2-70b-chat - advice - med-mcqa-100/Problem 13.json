His physical examination reveals a healthy-looking baby with a stable vital sign, except for a moderate dehydration. The patient's symptoms persist, and he is admitted to the hospital for further management.\nThe investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis is:\n\nA: USG\nB: UGI series\nC: CT\nD: MRI\n\nI previously chose option B, UGI series, as my answer. However, upon reflection, I realize that UGI series is not the best choice for investigating pyloric stenosis in an infant. UGI series is more commonly used to diagnose upper gastrointestinal tract problems, such as gastroesophageal reflux or swallowing disorders.\n\nThe best investigation for pyloric stenosis would be option A, USG (Ultrasound). Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can effectively diagnose pyloric stenosis by visualizing the pylorus and assessing its diameter. A hypertrophic pylorus with a diameter <12 mm is diagnostic of pyloric stenosis. USG is also useful in excluding other causes of vomiting in infants, such as gallstones, pancreatitis, or appendicitis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A, USG.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
