Let's reflect on the properties of the impression materials mentioned in the question:\n\n* Condensation silicone: It is a type of impression material that sets by a chemical reaction, but it is not elastic.\n* Polyether: It is an elastic impression material, but it does not set by a chemical reaction. Instead, it sets by evaporation.\n* Polysulfide: It is an elastic impression material that sets by a chemical reaction, but it is not catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.\n* Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS): It is an elastic impression material that sets by a chemical reaction, and it is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.\n\nBased on the properties mentioned in the question, the correct answer is (D) Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS).\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
