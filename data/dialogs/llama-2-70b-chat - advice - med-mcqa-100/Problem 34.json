After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I confused type II hypersensitivity reactions with other types. I made sure to research and understand the different types of hypersensitivity reactions, study their characteristics, and practice identifying the type of hypersensitivity reaction given a description of a condition. I also made sure to double-check my answer by matching the characteristics of the condition to the characteristics of the hypersensitivity reaction. This helped me to correctly answer the question."
