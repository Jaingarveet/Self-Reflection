        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the question. The correct answer is choice D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n\nThe argument assumes that most Acme employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes, and that the move to Ocean View will result in a longer commute for most employees. This is evident in the statement \"most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.\" If most employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes, then the move to Ocean View will indeed result in a longer commute for most of them.\n\nTherefore, Action: Answer(\"D\") is the correct answer."
