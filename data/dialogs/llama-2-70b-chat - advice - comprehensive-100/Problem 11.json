After reevaluating the question and choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said, \"The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand.\"\n\nThis statement is the most doubtful of the assertions given because it does not provide any objective evidence or data to support the claim. The statement is merely an opinion or belief and does not take into account other factors that may contribute to rising housing prices, such as land prices or development costs.\n\nIn contrast, choices (A) and (B) provide specific data and statistics that support the assertion that rising land prices are a significant factor in soaring housing prices. Choice (C) also mentions the relationship between land development costs and house prices, which aligns with the given context.\n\nTherefore, I should have chosen (D) as the most doubtful assertion. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and correct my mistake.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
