        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculations. I misunderstood the question and used the wrong conversion factor.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to convert 20 inches to miles. We know that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles, so we can set up a proportion to find the conversion factor:\n1/4 inch = 10 miles\n20 inches = x miles\n\nWe can cross-multiply and simplify:\n20 inches \\* 10 miles/1/4 inch = x miles\n200 miles = x miles\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 200 to find the conversion factor:\nx miles / 200 miles = 1/4 inch / 10 miles\n1/5 miles = 1/4 inch\n\nNow, we can convert 20 inches to miles:\n20 inches \\* 1/5 miles/inch = 20/5 miles\n4 miles = x miles\n\nTherefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 4 miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
