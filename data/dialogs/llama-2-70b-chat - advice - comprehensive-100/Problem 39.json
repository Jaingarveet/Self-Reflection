        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Therefore, it must be true that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. This eliminates options A, C, and E, as they do not necessarily imply this relationship between violations of nature and the intention to invoke dread.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, directly states that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. This is in line with the passage's assertion that both kinds of horror stories share the feature of describing violations of the laws of nature and being intended to produce dread in the reader. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with."
