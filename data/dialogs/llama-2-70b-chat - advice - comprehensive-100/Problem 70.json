I incorrectly solved for the population of City X in 2010 instead of City Y. This time, I carefully read the question and wrote down the correct equation based on the information given. I solved for the variable (Y) in the equation and calculated the population of City Y in 2010, which is 130,600. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 90,000. I learned that it is important to always read the question carefully, write down the correct equation, and solve for the variable (Y) in the equation to get the correct answer."
