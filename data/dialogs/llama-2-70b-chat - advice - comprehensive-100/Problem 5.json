Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages of all members is 250.\nThe ages of the members are in arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months.\nWe can let the age of the youngest member be x, then the age of the oldest member would be x + (n - 1) \\* 3, where n is the number of members in the club.\nWe know that x + (n - 1) \\* 3 = 250.\n\nNow, we can solve for n:\nn = (250 - x) / 3\n\nSince the youngest member is 7 years old, x = 7 \\* 12 = 84.\nSubstituting this value into the equation above, we get:\nn = (250 - 84) / 3\nn = 166 / 3\nn = 55\n\nTherefore, the number of members in the club is 55.\nThe correct answer is E: 27.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
