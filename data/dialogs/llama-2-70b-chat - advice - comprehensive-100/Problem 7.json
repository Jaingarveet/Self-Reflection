        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I added 2.6 tons to the old average instead of using the formula New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items).\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.\n2. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is x tons.\n3. The total weight of the 11 vehicles (10 old + 1 new) is 12.2 + x tons.\n4. The average weight of the 11 vehicles is (12.2 + x) / 11.\n5. We want to find the weight of the new truck, x.\n\nNow, let's substitute the given information:\n\n1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.\n2. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is x tons.\n3. The total weight of the 11 vehicles (10 old + 1 new) is 12.2 + x tons.\n4. The average weight of the 11 vehicles is (12.2 + x) / 11.\n5. We want to find the weight of the new truck, x.\n\nWe can set up an equation using the formula for finding the new average:\nNew average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items)\n\n(12.2 + x) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = 12.2 + 2.6 - 12.2\n\nx = 2.6\n\nSo, the weight of the new heavy-duty truck is 2.6 tons.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
