Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe equation is 2z + 1 = z.\nI need to isolate the variable z.\nI can do this by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation, which results in:\n2z = z - 1\nNow, I can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:\nz = (z - 1)/2\nSimplifying, I get:\nz = 1/2\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
