        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as \"literature\" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nQuestion: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?\nChoices:\n  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.\n  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.\n  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.\n  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.\n  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.\n\n  Answer: D\n\nThe passage states that Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind, and that his musicians performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame. This implies that Ellington composed music that was specifically intended to be performed by the musicians he conducted, which is answer choice D.\n\nThe passage does not explicitly credit Ellington with inspiring Morrison's style of narration, so answer choice A is not supported. There is no information in the passage about Ellington preventing his musicians from performing lengthy solos, so answer choice B is not supported. Ellington is not mentioned as a character in Morrison's Jazz, so answer choice C is incorrect. There is no information in the passage about Ellington composing music of other genres, so answer choice E is not supported.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
