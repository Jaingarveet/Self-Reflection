        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term \"proverb\" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, \"Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are.\" Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly implied by the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners, then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition.\n  B: The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.\n  C: The ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.\n  D: There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.\n  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.\n\n  Answer: B\n\nThe passage suggests that proverbs serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity within Mexican American communities, and that they are used to transmit Mexican culture and language to younger generations. The passage states that \"proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment.\" It also notes that proverbs provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.\n\nTherefore, option B is the best answer, as it states that the frequent use of proverbs within any community serves, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community. This is supported by the passage, which highlights the role of proverbs in transmitting Mexican culture and language to younger generations and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity within Mexican American communities.\n\nOption A is not supported by the passage, as it suggests that the primary purpose of using proverbs to inculcate table manners is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition. While the passage does mention that proverbs can serve a didactic purpose, it does not suggest that this is their primary purpose or that it is uniquely associated with maintaining ties to an ethnic tradition.\n\nOption C is incorrect, as the passage notes that many Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, and that they are part of a common proverb tradition of Europe. Therefore, the ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are not necessarily typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.\n\nOption D is also incorrect, as while the passage notes that the meaning of a proverb can vary depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which it is used, it does not suggest that some proverbs do not require a verbal context to be understood.\n\nFinally, option E is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about the emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishing those communities from other communities within the United States.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

However, the passage does not suggest that this emphasis on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes Mexican American communities from other communities within the United States. Therefore, option E is not supported by the passage.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, is supported by the passage, which states that \"each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.\" This suggests that the meaning of a proverb can vary depending on the context in which it is used, and that it is not necessarily fixed. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it states that there are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs."
