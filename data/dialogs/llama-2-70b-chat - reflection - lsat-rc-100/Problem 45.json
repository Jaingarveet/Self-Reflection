        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated \"out of print.\" Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.\nQuestion: It can most reasonably be inferred that the author would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?\nChoices:\n  A: The changing literary tastes of consumers will be the main cause of the eventual transition to the new digital model.\n  B: The ease of keeping books \"in print\" will be the primary factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model.\n  C: The demauds of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model.\n  D: The development of innovative marketing strategies will ensure acceptance of the new digital model.\n  E: Widespread familiarily with new ways of storing information will be the primary reason for the acceptance of the new digital model.\n\n  Answer: B\n\nThe author suggests that the ease of keeping books \"in print\" will be a significant factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model. The author states that digital publishing allows for the instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text, making it possible to print books on demand at point of sale, eliminating the costs associated with traditional publishing, and making it possible to keep a virtually limitless digital catalog of books in print. The author also notes that this will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing, which will likely lead to its eventual acceptance.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the text. There is no mention of changing literary tastes (A), the role of literary agents (C), innovative marketing strategies (D), or widespread familiarity with new ways of storing information (E) as factors in the acceptance of the new digital model.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
