Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed. While oligohydramnios can restrict fetal movement, it's not the only factor influencing fetal lie. I failed to consider that placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie by physically obstructing the fetus from settling into a head-down position.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Incorrect reasoning\n*   Incomplete knowledge \n*   Misinterpretation of clinical scenario\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Understand the problem:** The question asks for the cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries.\n2. **Analyze the options:**\n    *   **Oligohydramnios:** Can restrict fetal movement, but not the only cause of unstable lie.\n    *   **Placenta previa:** Can physically obstruct the fetus from assuming a head-down position, leading to an unstable lie.\n    *   **Pelvic tumor:**  Less likely at this gestation with previous normal deliveries.\n    *   **Uterine anomalies:** Less likely with previous normal deliveries.\n3. **Choose the most likely cause:** Based on the analysis, placenta previa (B) is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in this scenario. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Consider all possible causes:** Don't focus on just one factor, even if it seems likely. \n2. **Analyze each option carefully:** Evaluate how each option could contribute to the presented scenario.\n3. **Prioritize based on likelihood:** Consider the patient's history and the gestational age when assessing the likelihood of each option.\n4. **Review knowledge gaps:** If unsure, research the topic further to improve understanding.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Think comprehensively:** Consider all aspects of the patient's presentation and history.\n*   **Develop differential diagnoses:** List all possible causes and systematically evaluate each one.\n*   **Stay updated:** Continuously update medical knowledge to ensure accurate diagnoses.\n*   **Consult resources:** Utilize textbooks, medical journals, and colleagues for clarification and support. \n"
