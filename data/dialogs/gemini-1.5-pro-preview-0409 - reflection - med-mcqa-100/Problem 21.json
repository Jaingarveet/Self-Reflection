Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I incorrectly associated Falciparum malaria with a broader range of red blood cell targets than it actually has.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Knowledge Gap\n*   Microbiology\n*   Malaria Types\n*   Red Blood Cell Targeting\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Recall Malaria Types:** There are four main types of malaria: Vivax, Ovale, Falciparum, and Quartan (caused by different Plasmodium species).\n2.  **RBC Lifespan:** Red blood cells have a lifespan of about 120 days, after which they become senescent.\n3.  **Malaria Targeting:** Each malaria type has a preference for infecting RBCs of specific ages.\n4.  **Identify Correct Type:** Quartan malaria (Plasmodium malariae) specifically targets older, senescent red blood cells.\n**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**\n1.  **Review Malaria Types:** Clearly differentiate the four main types of malaria and their characteristics.\n2.  **Understand RBC Lifespan:** Learn about the different stages of red blood cell development and aging.\n3.  **Research Target Cells:**  Investigate the specific red blood cell preferences of each malaria type.\n4.  **Associate Type with Target:** Create a clear association between each malaria type and its preferred red blood cell age.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Address Knowledge Gaps:** Continuously identify and address gaps in medical knowledge.\n*   **Consult Reliable Sources:** Utilize textbooks, medical journals, and reputable online resources for accurate information.\n*   **Focus on Specific Details:** Pay close attention to the specific details of each disease and its causative agent.\n*   **Develop Differential Diagnosis Skills:** Practice differentiating between similar diseases based on their unique characteristics. \n*   **Stay Updated:** Keep up with the latest research and advancements in the field of medicine. \n"
