Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from a misconception about the drainage pathway of the right suprarenal vein. I incorrectly assumed it drained into the right renal vein, overlooking its direct connection to the inferior vena cava. This highlights a gap in my knowledge regarding specific venous drainage patterns.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Knowledge gap\n*   Anatomy misconception\n*   Venous drainage error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Inferior Vena Cava Tributaries:** Recall that the inferior vena cava receives blood from various veins in the lower body and abdomen.\n2.  **Eliminate Portal System Veins:** Recognize that the superior and inferior mesenteric veins belong to the hepatic portal system, draining into the liver via the hepatic portal vein, not the inferior vena cava.\n3.  **Renal Vein Drainage:** Remember that renal veins directly drain blood from the kidneys into the inferior vena cava.\n4.  **Suprarenal Vein Drainage:** Identify the right suprarenal vein as a direct tributary of the inferior vena cava, carrying blood from the right adrenal gland.\n## Future Instructions\n1.  **Review Venous Drainage Patterns:** Thoroughly study and understand the specific drainage pathways of major veins, including those associated with organs like the kidneys and adrenal glands.\n2.  **Focus on Direct Tributaries:** Pay close attention to veins that directly empty into the inferior vena cava, differentiating them from those that drain indirectly through other vessels.\n3.  **Visualize Anatomical Relationships:** Utilize anatomical diagrams and models to visualize the connections between veins and their target vessels.\n## General Advice\n*   **Address Knowledge Gaps:** Actively identify and address gaps in anatomical knowledge through focused study and review.\n*   **Consult Reliable Sources:** Utilize textbooks, anatomical atlases, and reputable online resources to verify information and clarify uncertainties.\n*   **Practice Recall and Application:** Regularly test your understanding of anatomical concepts through practice questions and case studies. \n"
