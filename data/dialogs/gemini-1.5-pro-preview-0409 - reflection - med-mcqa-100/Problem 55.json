Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy reasoning was flawed because I overemphasized the presence of multiple tumors as an indicator of advanced disease, overlooking the possibility of multiple primary tumors or oligometastatic disease, both potentially still amenable to surgical resection.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*  Misinterpretation of clinical data \n*  Incorrect application of treatment guidelines for lung cancer\n*  Overlooking surgical options for multifocal lung tumors \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Analyze the clinical scenario:** A 60-year-old male with two separate lung tumors (5x5 cm in the upper lobe and 2x2 cm in the middle lobe) diagnosed as carcinoma.\n2. **Consider treatment options for lung cancer:** Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and supportive care are all potential options depending on the stage and specific characteristics of the cancer.\n3. **Evaluate the role of surgery:** While multiple tumors might suggest advanced disease, it's crucial to consider the possibility of multiple primary tumors or oligometastatic disease, where surgery can still be curative.\n4. **Assess surgical resectability:**  The size and location of the tumors, the patient's overall health, and pulmonary function tests would determine if surgical resection is feasible.\n5. **Conclusion:**  Given the information provided, surgery appears to be the most likely primary treatment modality, with the final decision depending on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient and the specific characteristics of the tumors. \n## Instructions for Future Problem-Solving\n1. **Carefully analyze all clinical data:**  Consider the size, location, and number of tumors, as well as the patient's overall health status.\n2. **Review current guidelines for lung cancer treatment:** Stay updated on the latest recommendations for different stages and types of lung cancer.\n3. **Consider all treatment modalities:** Evaluate the potential role of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and supportive care based on the specific clinical scenario.\n4. **Consult additional resources if needed:** Seek expert opinions or refer to medical literature for complex cases.\n5. **Think critically and avoid jumping to conclusions:**  Don't rule out treatment options based on initial impressions; consider all possibilities.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Stay updated on current medical knowledge and guidelines.**\n* **Develop a systematic approach to clinical problem-solving.**\n* **Consider differential diagnoses and various treatment options.**\n* **Seek additional information and expert opinions when necessary.**\n* **Learn from mistakes and continuously improve your clinical reasoning skills.** \n"
