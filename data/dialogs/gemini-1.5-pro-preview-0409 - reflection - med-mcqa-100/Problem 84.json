Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from a misunderstanding of the mechanism of action for each medication and its impact on aqueous outflow. While Brinzolamide does reduce aqueous humor production, I failed to recall that Pilocarpine, a muscarinic agonist, directly affects the trabecular meshwork by causing ciliary muscle contraction and opening the drainage angle, thus increasing aqueous outflow.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Pharmacology knowledge gap\n* Mechanism of action confusion\n* Aqueous outflow misunderstanding\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Identify the target:** The question asks about medications affecting the trabecular meshwork and aqueous outflow.\n2. **Analyze each medication:**\n    * **Timolol:** Non-selective beta-blocker, reduces aqueous humor production but does not directly affect the trabecular meshwork.\n    * **Pilocarpine:** Muscarinic agonist, causes ciliary muscle contraction, opening the trabecular meshwork and increasing outflow.\n    * **Brimonidine:** Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reduces aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow, but does not directly target the trabecular meshwork.\n    * **Brinzolamide:** Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, reduces aqueous humor production but does not directly affect the trabecular meshwork.\n3. **Choose the correct medication:** Based on the analysis, **Pilocarpine (B)** directly affects the trabecular meshwork and increases aqueous outflow. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Review the anatomy and physiology of the eye**, focusing on aqueous humor production and outflow pathways, including the role of the trabecular meshwork.\n2. **Thoroughly understand the mechanism of action for each medication class** mentioned in the answer choices, specifically regarding their impact on aqueous humor dynamics.\n3. **Differentiate between medications that reduce aqueous humor production and those that directly affect outflow** through the trabecular meshwork.\n4. **Consider the specific wording of the question** to ensure you are addressing the targeted mechanism of action.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Strengthen your foundation in pharmacology:** Regularly review the mechanisms of action for commonly used medications, especially those within the same class.\n* **Create a table or chart summarizing the effects of different medication classes** on aqueous humor dynamics for quick reference.\n* **Practice applying your knowledge to clinical scenarios** to solidify your understanding and improve recall.\n* **Consult reliable resources** such as pharmacology textbooks or online databases to clarify any uncertainties. \n"
