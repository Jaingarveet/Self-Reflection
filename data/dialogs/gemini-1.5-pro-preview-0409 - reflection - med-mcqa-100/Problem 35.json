Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Therefore, I cannot determine the specific cardiac abnormality and choose the correct diagnosis. \nAction: I cannot answer this question without analyzing the chest X-ray. \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

However, a definitive diagnosis requires careful analysis of the chest X-ray and other clinical findings by a qualified medical professional.\nInstructions:\n1.  **Gather information:** Obtain the patient's history, physical examination findings, and any available imaging studies, including the chest X-ray.\n2.  **Analyze the chest X-ray:** Look for specific features associated with each potential diagnosis, such as heart size, shape, and pulmonary vascular markings.\n3.  **Correlate X-ray findings with clinical presentation:** Consider the patient's symptoms and signs, such as cyanosis, heart failure, and respiratory distress, in conjunction with the X-ray findings.\n4.  **Consider additional tests:** If necessary, recommend further investigations such as echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.\n5.  **Formulate a differential diagnosis:** List the possible diagnoses based on the available evidence, and prioritize them based on the likelihood.\n6.  **Reach a final diagnosis:** Based on all the gathered information, make the most probable diagnosis.\nAdvice:\n*   **Recognize limitations:** Understand that I cannot analyze images or replace the expertise of a medical professional.\n*   **Focus on providing information:** Offer relevant details about each condition and its typical presentation to aid in the diagnostic process.\n*   **Emphasize the importance of clinical correlation:** Highlight the need to consider the patient's history, physical examination, and other investigations in conjunction with imaging findings.\n*   **Promote collaboration:** Encourage healthcare professionals to work together and utilize all available resources to reach an accurate diagnosis. \n"
