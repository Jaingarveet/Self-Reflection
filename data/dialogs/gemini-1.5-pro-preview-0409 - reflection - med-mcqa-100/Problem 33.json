Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This demonstrates a gap in my knowledge regarding the specific target antigens in different autoimmune blistering diseases.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*  **Knowledge Gap:** Misidentification of target antigen\n*  **Confusion:**  Between similar autoimmune blistering diseases \n*  **Specificity:**  Lack of understanding of subtle differences in disease pathology\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1. **Recall:** Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease affecting the basement membrane zone.\n2. **Differentiate:**  Distinguish it from Bullous pemphigoid, which targets different antigens.\n3. **Identify:** The key target antigen in Cicatricial pemphigoid is Collagen XVII (also known as BP180).\n4. **Salt Split Skin Technique:** Remember that this technique separates the epidermis from the dermis at the level of the lamina lucida.\n5. **Location:** Collagen XVII is located in the lamina lucida, on the epidermal side of the split.\n6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, in Cicatricial pemphigoid, IgG autoantibodies bind to Collagen XVII on the epidermal side of the salt split skin.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. **Review:**  Autoimmune blistering diseases and their specific target antigens.\n2. **Differentiate:** Clearly distinguish between similar conditions like Bullous pemphigoid and Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n3. **Focus:** Pay close attention to the specific details of each disease, including the location and function of target antigens.\n4. **Salt Split Skin Technique:** Understand the principles and interpretation of this technique in the context of autoimmune blistering diseases.\n**General Advice:**\n* **Knowledge Base:** Continuously expand and update your medical knowledge base.\n* **Differential Diagnosis:**  Develop strong skills in differential diagnosis to distinguish between similar conditions.\n* **Attention to Detail:** Focus on the specific details and nuances of each disease and diagnostic test.\n* **Review and Update:** Regularly review and update your understanding of complex topics. \n"
