Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly associated the visual description of the etching pattern with the wrong term. I focused on the \"rounded, bubbly appearance\" and linked it to \"soap bubble\" without considering other possibilities.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misidentification \n*   Terminology confusion\n*   Visual descriptor misassociation\n## Solving the Problem\n1. **Recall Etching Patterns:** Review the different types of etching patterns and their characteristics.\n2. **Visualize Type 2 Pattern:**  Focus on the specific features of the Type 2 pattern beyond just \"rounded\" or \"bubbly.\" Consider terms like \"irregular,\" \"raised,\" and \"varied sizes.\"\n3. **Match Description to Term:** Connect the visual characteristics to the appropriate term. The irregular, raised appearance is more akin to a \"cobblestone\" than a uniform \"soap bubble.\"\n## Instructions for Future\n1. **Review Terminology:** Regularly refresh your memory on key terms and their associated visual descriptions.\n2. **Analyze Visuals Carefully:** Go beyond the initial impression and identify specific distinguishing features.\n3. **Consider Multiple Options:** Don't jump to conclusions based on a single characteristic; explore all possibilities before choosing an answer.\n4. **Create Associations:** Develop memory aids to link visual descriptions with the correct terms (e.g., flashcards, diagrams).\n## General Advice\n*   **Active Learning:** Engage in active learning strategies like self-testing and summarizing information to solidify understanding.\n*   **Visual Aids:** Utilize visual resources such as diagrams and images to enhance memory and comprehension.\n*   **Seek Clarification:** When unsure, consult reliable sources or experts to clarify concepts and terminology. \n*   **Practice Application:** Apply your knowledge to different scenarios and case studies to reinforce learning. \n"
