Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nWhile both Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch played significant roles in developing and proving the germ theory of disease, the question asks for the individual who *proposed* the theory. My error was in attributing the proposal solely to Koch, neglecting Pasteur's foundational contributions.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Attribution error\n*   Historical figure identification error\n*   Germ theory of disease knowledge gap\n## Solving the Problem\n1.  **Recall the key figures in the history of germ theory:** Leeuwenhoek, Koch, Pasteur, and Paré.\n2.  **Eliminate options based on their contributions:**\n    *   Leeuwenhoek: First to observe microorganisms, but did not link them to disease.\n    *   Koch: Developed postulates to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease.\n    *   Paré: Pioneer in surgery and battlefield medicine, predating germ theory.\n    *   **Pasteur:** Conducted experiments with fermentation and pasteurization, demonstrating the role of microbes in causing disease and spoilage.\n3.  **Identify the individual who proposed the theory:** Based on the analysis, Louis Pasteur is the most appropriate answer as he laid the groundwork for the germ theory with his experiments and observations.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Carefully analyze the question:** Pay attention to keywords like \"proposed\" to understand the specific requirement.\n2.  **Review relevant historical figures and their contributions:** Ensure a comprehensive understanding of each individual's role in the development of the theory.\n3.  **Differentiate between observation, experimentation, and proposal:** Recognize the distinct stages in the development of a scientific theory.\n4.  **Consider the timeline of events:** Understand the chronological order of discoveries and proposals to accurately attribute the theory.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Strengthen knowledge base:** Continuously expand your understanding of key scientific figures and their contributions.\n*   **Develop critical thinking skills:** Analyze information carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions.\n*   **Pay attention to detail:** Focus on specific keywords and requirements within the question.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on errors and adjust your approach for future problem-solving. \n"
