Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This was a misconception and a failure to recall the specific inheritance pattern of Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Medical knowledge gap\n*   Genetics/Inheritance pattern error\n## Solving the Problem\n1. **Recall the condition:** Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a phosphate-wasting disorder.\n2. **Inheritance Pattern:** This condition is known to be X-linked dominant (XD).\n3. **Matching with Choices:** The option that corresponds to X-linked dominant inheritance is \"C: XD\".\n## Instructions for Future\n1. **Focus on the full name:**  Pay attention to the complete name of the condition, not just parts of it.\n2. **Recall inheritance patterns:** Review and memorize the inheritance patterns of key genetic disorders.\n3. **Avoid assumptions:** Do not make assumptions based on partial information or perceived connections.\n4. **Cross-reference if unsure:** If unsure about the inheritance pattern, consult a reliable medical genetics resource.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Build a strong foundation:** Ensure a solid understanding of basic medical concepts, including genetics and inheritance patterns.\n*   **Use reliable resources:** Refer to textbooks, medical journals, or reputable online databases for accurate information.\n*   **Practice recall and application:** Regularly test your knowledge by answering practice questions and applying concepts to clinical scenarios.\n*   **Stay updated:** Keep up with advancements in medical knowledge and genetics through continuing education. \n"
