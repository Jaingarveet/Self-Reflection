Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

[step] You can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. Often, diviners use forked sticks from trees such as willow, peach, and witch hazel.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Some people also use exaggerated branches or canes because canes have been used so often in witchcraft. There may even be string hung from the branches before getting started on your project.\n  B: Look for a stick that has a fork with branches of equal length on either end of the fork. [substeps] If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod.\n  C: You will buy one in a hardware store or hunting store. [substeps] Dowsing or divining rods are no different than sticks, and will require signatures on the stick, such as a helix, that you'll use to figure out how to cast your spells.\n  D: These cast sparks, and are useful tools for lighting up a fire. [title] Bring a 9 \" x 5 \" square.\n\nThought: \nThe text describes the use of natural items as dowsing or divining rods, and the choices refer to the specific types of sticks that can be used and why.\nChoice A mentions using exaggerated branches or canes, which is a common practice in witchcraft, and the presence of strings hung from branches. This choice provides additional context and a specific example related to the topic.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
