Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Understand the context: the text describes a group of boys engaged in a sports drill.\n2. Identify the key elements: running, throwing, hitting a ball, and team formation.\n3. Recognize the social dynamics: the boys are working together as a team.\n4. Consider common rituals in team sports: drills often end with debriefs or strategy sessions.\n5. Interpret the choices:\n    - A describes a complex field game with multiple teams, which is unlikely to follow a simple drill.\n    - B mentions an unrelated game and has no connection to the described activity.\n    - C suggests the activity is over, but team sports drills often end with discussions, not just walking away.\n    - D aligns with the social dynamics and common rituals of team sports drills.\n6. Select the most sensible completion: choice D.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the context and interpret the text within that framework.\n - Identify key elements and dynamics of the described situation.\n - Recognize common patterns and rituals associated with the context.\n - Interpret choices based on their alignment with the expected patterns and rituals.\n - Avoid choosing answers that introduce unrelated or overly complex elements.\n - Trust your common sense and select the most logical and sensible completion."
