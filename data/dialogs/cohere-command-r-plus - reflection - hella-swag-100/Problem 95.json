Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the narrative and made assumptions about the drummer's actions and intentions that were not supported by the text. I expected the story to include a dramatic or emotional reaction (\"shakes his head and smiles\"), but the correct answer is more practical and relates directly to the context of drumming.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Interpretation error\n - Assumption error\n - Context error\n\nSolution:\nThe text describes a drummer holding sticks, playing, and then stopping to open his mouth. The most likely reason for the drummer to open his mouth is to take a breath or pause, suggesting a transition or preparation for the next action. The correct answer, \"places the sticks on the drum,\" is a logical and practical continuation of the narrative, indicating the drummer's natural action after stopping.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the text carefully and identify the subject and their actions.\n2. Understand the context and the sequence of events.\n3. Avoid making assumptions about the subject's intentions or emotions.\n4. Consider the most practical and logical continuation of the narrative.\n5. Choose the answer that aligns with the context and follows the sequence of events.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the text carefully and identify the key details.\n - Understand the context and the sequence of events to make logical inferences.\n - Avoid making assumptions or interpreting actions based on your expectations.\n - Consider the most practical and plausible continuation of the narrative.\n - Stay focused on the specific context provided and avoid introducing unrelated elements."
