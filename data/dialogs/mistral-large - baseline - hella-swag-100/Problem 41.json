[step] If this is your first time dancing, don't try out complicated moves you might have seen in a music video. No one is expecting you to do so, and many of your classmates are probably thinking too much about how they look themselves.\nChoices:\n  A: Avoid trying out other moves or movements that all of your peers are unfamiliar with. Don't use these movements as excuses as they may be too awkward.\n  B: Start building up your confidence and learn some of the moves before you try them out. Maybe you know what to do better than the person dancing to your right.\n  C: [substeps] Try to blend in by mimicking your classmates' movements. Most djs at your middle school dance will probably play simple, high energy songs with an identifiable rhythm.\n  D: Instead, try dancing with your hands or open arms as the band starts to play. [title] Use the opportunity to learn something new.\n"

The most likely completion to the text would be a suggestion that fits with this advice.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nOption C suggests mimicking classmates' movements, which aligns with the advice to keep things simple and not try complicated moves. It also acknowledges that the music played at a middle school dance is likely to be simple and high energy, making it easier to follow along. Option A is too negative and doesn't provide any constructive advice. Option B suggests building up confidence and learning moves beforehand, which goes against the advice to keep things simple. Option D suggests dancing with hands or open arms, which may not be appropriate for a middle school dance and doesn't necessarily align with the advice to keep things simple."
