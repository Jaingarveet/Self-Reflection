[step] You can try to manage your addiction to chocolate by having it in moderation as part of a daily snack. Incorporating chocolate in a limited and healthy way into your diet can make it easier to control your cravings.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] You may try having chocolate covered fruit, such as strawberries, blueberries, or melon, as a snack rather than a chocolate bar. Or you may have trail mix that contains dark chocolate pieces or try chocolate covered nuts as a snack.\n  B: Once you know how to manage your chocolate addiction, you can use it in moderation to accomplish the same goals. [substeps] You can experiment with chocolate-infused, variety-based snacks to help you get used to eating chocolate.\n  C: [substeps] Keep the chocolate on hand, so it remains in good good form. Mix it into an individual muffin at lunch every morning, or use it with other indulgent snacks like cookies, cakes, and hummus.\n  D: At the same time, there are many long-term effects on your mental health. For instance, blood sugar levels are lowering dramatically, and allowing chocolate to fully replace them can have a negative effect on your self-esteem.\n"
