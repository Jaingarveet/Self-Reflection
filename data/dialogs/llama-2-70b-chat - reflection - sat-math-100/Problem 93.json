Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the data in the table. I mistakenly thought that the number of male respondents enrolled in Algebra I (44) was the number of respondents enrolled in Geometry.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation of data\n* Careless mistake\n* Lack of attention to detail\n\nSolution:\nLet's examine the table again:\n\n| | | Course | | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender | Female | 35 | 53 | 62 |\n|  | Male | 44 | 59 | 57 |\n|  | Total | 79 | 112 | 119 | 310 |\n\nWe can see that the number of male respondents enrolled in Geometry is 59, not 44. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Males taking Geometry, which accounts for approximately 19% of all survey respondents.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Carefully examine the data in the table.\n2. Identify the correct category that accounts for approximately 19% of all survey respondents.\n3. Choose the corresponding answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always double-check your calculations and data interpretation.\n* Be careful when comparing values in different columns of a table.\n* Take your time to avoid careless mistakes.\n* Practice active reading and pay attention to details."
