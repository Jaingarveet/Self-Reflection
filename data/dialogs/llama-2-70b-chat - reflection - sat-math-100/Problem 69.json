I misunderstood the problem and calculated the wrong value for the number of miles Alan needs to reduce.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Misunderstanding the problem\n- Incorrect calculation\n\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline is $4$ per gallon.\n2. He wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\\$ 5$.\n3. Therefore, he needs to save $\\$ 5$ on gasoline per week.\n4. Since gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, he needs to save $\\$ 5$ / $\\$ 4$ = 1.25 gallons of gasoline per week.\n5. Since Alan's car can travel 25 miles per gallon, he needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 1.25 \\* 25 = 31.25 miles.\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n\nA: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\nB: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\nC: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\nD: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\n\nThe correct equation is D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$, which means that Alan needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 5 \\* 25 = 125 miles.\n\nInstructions:\n1.
