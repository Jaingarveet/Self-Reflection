Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the population of interest (all employees of the company).\n2. Determine the sampling method (random sampling).\n3. Select a random sample of employees from each store.\n4. Ensure that the sample is representative of the population.\n5. Administer the survey to the selected employees.\n6. Calculate the proportion of employees who are satisfied with their job.\n7. Generalize the results to the entire population.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always understand the concept of sampling and its relation to the population.\n* Always choose a sampling method that is appropriate for the population and the research question.\n* Always ensure that the sample is representative of the population.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Always consider potential sources of error and bias in your sampling method."
