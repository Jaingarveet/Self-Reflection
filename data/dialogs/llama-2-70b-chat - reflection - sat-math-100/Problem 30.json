Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.\n  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.\n  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\n\n  Let's analyze the supply function $S(P)$:\n\n$S(P) = \\frac{1}{2} P + 40$\n\nWe can see that the coefficient of $P$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so a $10$ dollar increase in the price ($P + 10$) will result in a $\\frac{10}{2} = 5$ unit increase in the quantity supplied.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
