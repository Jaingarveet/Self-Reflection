Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Based on the equation, which of the following must be true?I. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.II. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.III. A temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.\nChoices:\n  A: I only\n  B: II only\n  C: III only\n  D: I and II only\n\n  Let's analyze the given equation:\n\n$$C = \\frac{5}{9}(F - 32)$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation as follows:\n\n$$F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$$\n\nNow, let's consider the three options:\n\nI. A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.\n\nThis statement is false. If the temperature increases by 1 degree Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by $\\frac{9}{5}$ degrees.\n\nII. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThis statement is true. We can see this by rearranging the equation:\n\n$$F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$$\n\nIf the temperature in Celsius increases by 1 degree, the temperature in Fahrenheit will increase by $\\frac{9}{5}$ degrees, which is approximately 1.8 degrees.\n\nIII. A temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius.\n\nThis statement is false. If the temperature increases by $\\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature in Celsius will increase by less than 1 degree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: II only. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

Therefore, option I is true.\n\nAdditionally, a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, as we can see by rearranging the equation:\n\n$$F = \\frac{9}{5}C + 32$$\n\nTherefore, option II is also true.\n\nOption III is false, as a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of less than 1 degree Celsius.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: I and II only."
