There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)\nChoices:\n  A: 0.410\n  B: 0.357\n  C: 0.333\n  D: 0.250\n\n  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The total number of left-handed students is 18.\n2. The total number of right-handed students is 122.\n3. The number of right-handed female students is 5 times the number of left-handed female students.\n4. The number of right-handed male students is 9 times the number of left-handed male students.\n\nNow, let's use this information to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.\n\nLet LF be the number of left-handed female students.\nLet RF be the number of right-handed female students.\nLet LM be the number of left-handed male students.\nLet RM be the number of right-handed male students.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n\nRF = 5LF\nRM = 9LM\n\nWe also know that the total number of left-handed students is 18, so:\n\nLF + LM = 18\n\nSimilarly, the total number of right-handed students is 122, so:\n\nRF + RM = 122\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations. First, we can solve the second equation for LM:\n\nLM = (122 - RF) / 9\n\nNow, substitute this expression for LM into the first equation:\n\nLF + (122 - RF) / 9 = 18\n\nMultiply both sides by 9 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n9LF + 122 - RF = 162\n\nNow, solve for RF:\n\nRF = 122 - 9LF\n\nNow, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female:\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = RF / (RF + RM)\n\nSubstituting the expression for RF, we get:\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 9LF) / (122 - 9LF + RM)\n\nNow, we can simplify this expression. The denominator is equal to the total number of right-handed students (122), so:\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 9LF) / 122\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 9LF / 122\n\nNow, we can substitute the values we know:\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 9(18) / 122\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 162 / 122\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = 1 - 1.33\n\nProb(right-handed student is female) = 0.357\n\nTherefore, the closest answer choice is B: 0.357.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
