However, the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows that as $t$ decreases, $a$ also decreases. Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the formula\n* Incorrect reasoning\n\nSolution:\nWe need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.\nWe can start by noticing that the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ implies that as $t$ increases, $a$ also increases.\nTherefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.\nWe can now look at the given choices:\n\n$-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n\nThe largest value of $t$ is $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$, so we can choose option B.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
