Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?\nChoices:\n  A: 3\n  B: $\\quad 5.7$\n  C: 9.5\n  D: 14.3\n\n  Thought: \nWe are given the equation h = 3a + 28.6, which represents a linear function.\nTo find the estimated increase in height each year, we need to find the slope of the line.\nThe slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.\nIn this case, we can choose any two values for a, such as a = 2 and a = 3.\nSubstituting a = 2 into the equation, we get h = 3(2) + 28.6 = 3(3) + 28.6 = 100.8.\nSubstituting a = 3 into the equation, we get h = 3(3) + 28.6 = 108.6.\nNow we can calculate the slope:\nSlope = (108.6 - 100.8) / (3 - 2) = 7.8 / 1 = 7.8\nThe slope tells us that the boy's height increases by 7.8 inches each year.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Identify the equation that represents the relationship between the boy's height and age.\n2. Choose two values for the age, a, and substitute them into the equation to find the corresponding heights.\n3. Calculate the slope of the line by finding the difference in heights and dividing it by the difference in ages.\n4. Interpret the slope as the estimated increase in height each year.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always pay attention to units when calculating and interpreting slopes.\n* Make sure to choose appropriate values for the variables when finding the slope.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Use the equation to find the estimated increase in height for a specific age, rather than relying on the slope alone."
