Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I thought it was asking which materials can be recycled, not which can be reused many times. While steel cans can be recycled, they are not typically reused many times in the same form, unlike glass bottles.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Recycling\n- Reuse\nSolution:\nThe question asks which materials can be reused many times. The correct answer is glass bottles. Glass bottles can be cleaned and sterilized, then reused many times without losing their quality or integrity. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to understand what it's asking.\n2. Consider each answer choice individually.\n3. Remember that recycling and reusing are not the same. Recycling involves breaking down a product into raw materials and making new products, while reusing involves using the same item again in its original form.\n4. Choose the answer that best fits the question.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking.\n- Don't rush to answer; take your time to consider each choice.\n- Remember the difference between recycling and reusing.\n- Use your knowledge of materials and their properties to guide your answer."
