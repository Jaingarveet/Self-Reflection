I mistakenly took the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances between the two points instead of taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between the coordinates of the two points.\n\nThe correct formula for the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to find the length of $\\overline{AB}$:\n\n(x1, y1) = (11, 0)\n(x2, y2) = (11, 25)\n\ndistance = sqrt((11-11)^2 + (25-0)^2)\ndistance = sqrt(0 + 625)\ndistance = sqrt(625)\ndistance = 25\n\nSo, the length of $\\overline{AB}$ is 25.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
