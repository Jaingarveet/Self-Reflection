Write the system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n2.4 x - 1.5 y &= 0.3 \\\\\n1.6 x + 0.5 y &= -1.3\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n2. Solve the first equation for $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1.5 y}{2.4}$$\n\n3. Substitute the expression for $x$ into the second equation:\n\n$$1.6 \\left(\\frac{1.5 y}{2.4}\\right) + 0.5 y = -1.3$$\n\n4. Simplify and solve for $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{1.5 y}{2.4} + 0.5 y = -1.3$$\n\n$$\\frac{1.5 y}{2.4} = -1.8$$\n\n$$y = -2.4 \\cdot 2.4 = -5.76$$\n\n5. Now that we have $y$, we can find $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1.5 y}{2.4}$$\n\n$$x = \\frac{1.5 (-5.76)}{2.4} = -1.44$$\n\n6. The $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $-1.44$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
