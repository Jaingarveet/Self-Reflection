There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)\nChoices:\n  A: 0.410\n  B: 0.357\n  C: 0.333\n  D: 0.250\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.\n- Always identify the variables and their relationships.\n- Always write down the equations based on the given information.\n- Always solve the system of equations.\n- Always calculate the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.\n- Always simplify the expression, if possible.\n- Always check the answer to ensure it is reasonable.\n- Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with fractions.\n- Be careful when calculating probabilities, especially when dealing with negative numbers.\n"
