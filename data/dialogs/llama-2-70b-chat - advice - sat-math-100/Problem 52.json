I misunderstood the problem and used the wrong variables in my calculation.\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n1. Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees.\n2. Type A trees produced 144 pears.\n3. To find the number of pears produced by Type B trees, we need to subtract 20% of 144 from 144.\n4. 20% of 144 is 28.8 (rounded to the nearest whole number is 29).\n5. Subtracting 29 from 144 gives us 115.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 115.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
