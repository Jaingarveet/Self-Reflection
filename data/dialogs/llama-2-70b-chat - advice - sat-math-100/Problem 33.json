I must have gotten confused and used the formula for the equation of a sphere instead of a circle.\nThe correct formula for the equation of a circle with center $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ is:\n$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to the given circle:\nCenter: $(5, 7)$\nRadius: 2\n\nSo, the equation of the circle is:\n$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 2^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 4$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
