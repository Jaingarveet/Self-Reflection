I misunderstood the formula and plugged in the wrong values.\nLet's start by identifying the given information:\n- The weight of an object on Earth is 150 newtons.\n- The formula to find the weight of an object on a given planet is $W=mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\n- The acceleration due to gravity on each planet is given in the chart.\nNow, let's calculate the weight of the object on each planet:\n- Mercury: $W=m(3.6)=150\\times 3.6=540\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Venus: $W=m(8.9)=150\\times 8.9=1335\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Earth: $W=m(9.8)=150\\times 9.8=1470\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Mars: $W=m(3.8)=150\\times 3.8=570\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Jupiter: $W=m(26.0)=150\\times 26.0=4100\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Saturn: $W=m(11.1)=150\\times 11.1=1665\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Uranus: $W=m(10.7)=150\\times 10.7=1605\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\n- Neptune: $W=m(14.1)=150\\times 14.1=2115\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\nThe closest weight to the desired weight of 170 newtons is 1665 newtons, which is the weight of the object on Saturn.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Saturn.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
