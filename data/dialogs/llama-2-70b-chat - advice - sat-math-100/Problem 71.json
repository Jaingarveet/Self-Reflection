I misunderstood the information given in the question and calculated the probability incorrectly.\nHere's my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\nThe question asks for the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that the tablet user did not answer \"Never.\" We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem, which states:\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) \\* P(A) / P(B)\nIn this case, A represents the event that the tablet user answered \"Always,\" and B represents the event that the tablet user did not answer \"Never.\"\nWe want to find P(A|B), the probability of the tablet user answering \"Always,\" given that they did not answer \"Never.\"\nWe are given P(B), the probability of the tablet user not answering \"Never,\" which is 1 - 0.31 = 0.69.\nWe need to find P(A), the probability of the tablet user answering \"Always,\" which is 0.309 (30.9%).\nWe also need to find P(B|A), the probability of the tablet user not answering \"Never,\" given that they answered \"Always,\" which is 1 - 0.309 = 0.691.\nNow we can calculate P(A|B):\nP(A|B) = P(B|A) \\* P(A) / P(B)\n= 0.691 \\* 0.309 / 0.69\n= 0.313\nSo, the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that they did not answer \"Never,\" is approximately 0.313.\nThe closest answer is choice B: 0.38.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
