I misunderstood the question and didn't read it carefully.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We are given two equivalent ratios: $\\frac{5}{x} = \\frac{15}{x+20}$\n2. We can cross-multiply and simplify: $5x = 15(x+20)$\n3. We can expand and simplify: $5x = 15x + 300$\n4. We can subtract 15x from both sides: $5x - 15x = 300$\n5. We can simplify: $-10x = 300$\n6. We can divide both sides by -10: $\\frac{x}{5} = 30$\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: 5.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
