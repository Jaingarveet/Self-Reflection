The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.\n  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.\n  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully analyze the function and identify the relevant coefficients.\n* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always verify your answer by plugging it back into the original equation.\n"

        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the meaning of the coefficients in the supply function and demand function.\n\nThe supply function is given by $S(P) = \\frac{1}{2} P + 40$. To find the quantity supplied when the price is increased by $\\$ 10$, we need to substitute $P + 10$ into the function:\n\n$S(P + 10) = \\frac{1}{2} (P + 10) + 40$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$S(P + 10) = \\frac{1}{2} P + 10 + 40$\n\nComparing this with the original function $S(P)$, we can see that the coefficient of $P$ has changed from $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{1}{2} + 10$. This means that the quantity supplied will increase by 10 units for every unit increase in price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
