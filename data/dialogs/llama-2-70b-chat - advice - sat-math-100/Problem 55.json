I incorrectly identified the minimum value of the parabola.\n\nThe correct answer is B: Its minimum occurs at $(3, a)$.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The equation of the parabola is $y=-(x-3)^{2}+a$.\n2. To find the minimum value of the parabola, I need to find the vertex of the parabola.\n3. The vertex of the parabola occurs when the first derivative of the function is equal to zero.\n4. The first derivative of the function is $f'(x)=-2(x-3)$.\n5. Setting $f'(x)=0$ and solving for $x$ gives $x=3$.\n6. Therefore, the minimum value of the parabola occurs at $(3, a)$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
