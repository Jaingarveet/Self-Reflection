        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and solved for the wrong variable.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many fewer miles Alan should drive to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. We know that Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week and that his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. We also know that gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon.\n\nLet's break down the problem into smaller parts:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate how much Alan spends on gasoline per week:\n\nGasoline consumption per week = Total miles driven per week / Miles per gallon\nGasoline consumption per week = 100 / 25 = 4 gallons\n\nWeekly gasoline expenditure = Gasoline consumption per week x Gasoline price per gallon\nWeekly gasoline expenditure = 4 x $\\$ 4$ = $\\$ 16$\n\n2. Next, we need to calculate how much Alan wants to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure:\n\nDesired reduction in weekly gasoline expenditure = $\\$ 5$\n\n3. Now, we can calculate how many fewer miles Alan should drive per week to achieve his desired reduction in gasoline expenditure:\n\nFewer miles driven per week = (Desired reduction in weekly gasoline expenditure) / (Gasoline price per gallon x Miles per gallon)\nFewer miles driven per week = $\\$ 5$ / ($\\$ 4$ x 25) = $\\$ 5$ / 100 = 0.05\n\nTherefore, Alan should drive 5% fewer miles per week to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure by $\\$ 5$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
