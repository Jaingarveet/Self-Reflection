Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nWe are given two equations:\n\n$$3x + b = 5x - 7$$\n$$3y + c = 5y - 7$$\n\nWe know that $b$ and $c$ are constants. We can solve the first equation for $x$:\n\n$$x = \\frac{5x - 7 - 3b}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for $x$ into the second equation:\n\n$$3y + c = 5\\left(\\frac{5x - 7 - 3b}{3}\\right) - 7$$\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$3y + c = \\frac{25x - 21 - 3b}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{3} = \\frac{21 - 3b}{3}$$\n\nSolving for $b$, we get:\n\n$$b = \\frac{21 - 3c}{3}$$\n\nSince $b$ is $c$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$, we can substitute this expression for $b$ into the equation above:\n\n$$\\frac{21 - 3c}{3} = c - \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$21 - 3c = 3c - 1$$\n\nSolving for $c$, we get:\n\n$$c = \\frac{21 - 1}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can find $b$:\n\n$$b = c - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{21 - 1}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{21 - 3}{6} = \\frac{18}{6} = 3$$\n\nTherefore, $x$ is $y$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$, which corresponds to choice B.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
