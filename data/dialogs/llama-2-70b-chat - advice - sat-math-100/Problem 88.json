        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I mistakenly took the square root of a negative number, which is not possible.\nI have realized that the equation given in the question is a quadratic equation, and to find when the ball hits the ground, I need to find when the height is equal to zero.\nSo, I will set h = 0 and solve for t:\n0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t\n\nI will factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n(-4.9t + 12.5)(t - 2) = 0\n\nNow, I will solve for t:\n-4.9t + 12.5 = 0\nt - 2 = 0\n\nI will add 2 to both sides of the second equation:\nt = 2\n\nNow, I will check my answer by plugging t = 2 into the original equation:\nh = -4.9(2)^2 + 25(2)\nh = -19.8 + 50\nh = 30.2\n\nSince the height is positive, I know that the ball has not yet hit the ground. Therefore, I will round up to the nearest whole number, which is 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
