The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\$ 90$\n  B: $\\$ 120$\n  C: $\\$ 133$\n  D: $\\$ 155$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Make sure to carry out all calculations carefully and accurately, and avoid simple algebraic errors.\n"

I added $220$ and $P$ instead of subtracting $P$ from $220$.\n\nTo find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to set the supply function equal to the demand function and solve for $P$.\n\n$$S(P) = D(P)$$\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$$\n\n$$P + 40 = 220$$\n\n$$P = 180$$\n\nSo, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded is $\\$180$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
