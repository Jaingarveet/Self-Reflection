Let's carefully analyze the problem this time.\nGiven:\nTelevision price: $300\nInitial payment: $\\$ 60$\nWeekly payment: $\\$ 30$\n\nWe need to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase.\n\nEquation:\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\nTotal amount paid = Price of the television\nTotal amount paid = Initial payment + (Weekly payment x Number of weekly payments)\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\nTotal amount paid = \\$ 60 + (\\$ 30 x w)\n\nWe want to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, that will make the total amount paid equal to the price of the television, \\$ 300.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\\$ 60 + (\\$ 30 x w) = \\$ 300\n\nNow, we can solve for $w$:\n\\$ 300 = \\$ 60 + (\\$ 30 x w)\n\\$ 300 = \\$ 60 + \\$ 30w\n\\$ 300 = \\$ 90w\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by \\$ 90:\nw = \\$ 300/\\$ 90\nw = 3\n\nTherefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase of the television is 3.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
