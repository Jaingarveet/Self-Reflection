        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I added $0.25 x$ and $0.40 x$ instead of adding $b$ and $c$.\nThe correct way to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken is to set $b$ equal to $c$ and solve for $x$.\nSo, we have:\n$$2.35 + 0.25 x = 1.75 + 0.40 x$$\nSubtracting $0.25 x$ from both sides gives:\n$$2.10 = 1.35 + 0.40 x$$\nSubtracting $1.35$ from both sides gives:\n$$0.75 = 0.40 x$$\nDividing both sides by $0.40$ gives:\n$$1.875 = x$$\nNow, we need to find the price per pound of beef when $x = 1.875$.\nWe can do this by substituting $x = 1.875$ into the equation for $b$:\n$$b = 2.35 + 0.25(1.875) = 2.35 + 0.46875 = 2.81875$$\nSo, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\\$2.81875$.\nThe correct answer is (B) $\\$2.85$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
