I'll make sure to be more careful and thorough in my solution.\nThe equation given is:\nh=-16 t^2+v t+k\nWe are asked to find v in terms of h, t, and k.\nLet's first isolate v by subtracting k from both sides:\nh-k=-16 t^2+v t\nNow, divide both sides by t:\n(h-k)/t=-16 t+v\nNow, we can see that the only choice that matches our calculation is:\nC: v=(h+k)/t-16 t\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI reflected on my previous mistake and realized that I misread the equation and misunderstood the question.
