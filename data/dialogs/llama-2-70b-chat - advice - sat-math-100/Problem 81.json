I added 4z + 8y instead of using the distributive property to expand the expression.\n\nThe correct answer is choice D: $(4a + 8b)^2$.\n\nTo get this answer, we can start with the given equation $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.\n\nFirst, we can expand the right-hand side of the second equation: $ab = y$ as $a(b) = y$.\n\nNext, we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ to get $a^2 + (a(b))^2 = z$.\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can expand the expression $(a(b))^2$ as $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2$.\n\nTherefore, we have $a^2 + a^2b^2 = z$.\n\nSimplifying, we get $2a^2 + 2b^2 = z$.\n\nFinally, we can rewrite this expression as $(2a + 2b)^2 = z$.\n\nSince we are asked to find an equivalent expression for $4z + 8y$, we can rewrite $(2a + 2b)^2$ as $(4a + 8b)^2$ to get the desired expression.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: $(4a + 8b)^2$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
