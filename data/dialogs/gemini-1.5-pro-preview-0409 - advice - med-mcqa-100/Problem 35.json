The chest X-ray may show a \"boot-shaped\" heart.\n*   **VSD (Ventricular Septal Defect):**  A VSD is a hole in the wall between the heart's lower chambers. It can cause a heart murmur and may lead to heart failure if large. The chest X-ray findings can vary depending on the size and location of the defect.\n*   **TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection):** In TAPVC, the pulmonary veins carrying oxygenated blood from the lungs do not connect normally to the left atrium. This can lead to cyanosis and heart failure. The chest X-ray may show a \"snowman\" or \"figure-eight\" appearance of the heart.\n*   **TGA (Transposition of the Great Arteries):** TGA is a serious condition where the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched. This results in deoxygenated blood circulating in the body and oxygenated blood staying in the lungs. Infants with TGA usually present with cyanosis shortly after birth. The chest X-ray may show an \"egg-on-a-string\" appearance.\nGiven the neonate's presentation with heart failure on day 7 of life, **TAPVC is a strong possibility** as it aligns with the typical age of onset and symptoms. However, **clinical correlation with the X-ray findings, physical examination, and other investigations is crucial for a definitive diagnosis.**\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
