Damage to the RLN would cause hoarseness, which is not present in this case.\nThe superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) is responsible for sensation in the upper larynx and is also not directly involved in swallowing.\nThe glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) plays a role in taste sensation and swallowing. \nThe vagus nerve (CN X) is crucial for various functions, including swallowing, and its injury can lead to aspiration.\nSince the patient has recurrent aspirations without voice changes, the most likely injured nerve is the one responsible for swallowing function.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
