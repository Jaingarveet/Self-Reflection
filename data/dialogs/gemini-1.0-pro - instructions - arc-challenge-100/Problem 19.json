I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Problem:** I incorrectly identified the capital of Maryland as Baltimore instead of Annapolis.\n* **Solution:** I need to carefully read the question and consider all possible answers before selecting the best one.\n* **Correct Answer:** The capital of Maryland is Annapolis.\n**Answer:**\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")**\n**Explanation:**\nGlass bottles can be reused many times without losing their quality or integrity. This makes them a more sustainable option compared to other materials that can only be recycled a limited number of times or not at all.\n**Additional Information:**\n* Steel cans can also be recycled multiple times, but the process is more energy-intensive than recycling glass.\n* Paper containers can be recycled, but the fibers become weaker with each cycle, limiting the number of times they can be reused.\n* Plastic containers are typically not designed for multiple uses and often end up in landfills or incinerators."
