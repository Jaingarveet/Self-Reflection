Identify the key characteristics of a mixture:\n    - Composed of two or more substances\n    - Components retain their original properties\n    - Components can be physically separated\n2. Analyze the given scenario to determine if it aligns with these characteristics.\n3. If the components retain their individual properties and can be physically separated, classify the substance as a mixture.\n4. If the components have chemically combined to form a new substance with different properties, classify it as a compound.\n"

Peanuts remain peanuts, sunflower seeds remain sunflower seeds, and so on. Additionally, these components can be physically separated through methods like picking, sifting, or sorting.\nTherefore, the snack is classified as a mixture.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
