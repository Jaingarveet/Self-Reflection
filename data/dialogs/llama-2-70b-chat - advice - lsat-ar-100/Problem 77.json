Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Identify all the relevant information and rules that govern the problem.\n* Consider the impact of each rule on the assignment of parking spaces for each employee.\n* Evaluate each employee's options based on the rules and identify those with limited options.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the rules may have a domino effect, and one rule can impact another employee's options.\n"

Therefore, for Robertson, the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of four possible spaces.\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, for Young and Xu, the assignment of a parking space is limited to one of two possible spaces each.\nFor Togowa and Souza, the assignment of a parking space is not limited to only two possible spaces, as they can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces.\nVaughn is not subject to any specific rule, so the assignment of a parking space is not limited for Vaughn.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
