Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.\n- Always consider all the constraints and rules given in the problem.\n- Always place the businesses in the correct order based on their constraints.\n- Never make assumptions or jump to conclusions.\n- Always double-check your placements to ensure they meet all the constraints.\n- Remember that the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, not the other way around.\n"

We cannot place them next to each other, so we'll place one in space 3 and the other in space 6.\nNow, we must place the optometrist. It must be next to either the pharmacy or the veterinarian.
