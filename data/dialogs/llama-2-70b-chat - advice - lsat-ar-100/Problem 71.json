Let's analyze the problem carefully.\nThe question asks for a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra and Udall cannot work together in Zone 3.\nWe also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Thus, Stuckey must work in Zone 3.\nFurthermore, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and it cannot be Zone 1 (as either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1). Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.\nNow, let's evaluate the given choices:\n\nA: Kim, Mahr - Incorrect. Kim and Mahr do not work in Zone 3.\n\nB: Kim, Tiao - Incorrect. Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, as either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.\n\nC: Parra, Quinn - Correct. Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3.\n\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - Incorrect. Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2.\n\nE: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - Incorrect. Udall works in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Parra, Quinn.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
