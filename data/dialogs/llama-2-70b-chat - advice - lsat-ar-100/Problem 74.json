The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

I chose option A, but upon further reflection, I realized that it's not correct. The constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, eliminates the possibility of Jaramillo and Novetzke being assigned together. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: Kayne and Novetzke.\"\n\nNow, let's apply this reflection to the current question:\n\nThe question asks for the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships. We know that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Novetzke cannot be assigned to Venezuela. Therefore, the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships is Kayne and Novetzke.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
