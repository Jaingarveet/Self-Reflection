Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Therefore, Choice E (Robert gives a report on Wednesday) can be eliminated.\n\nFurthermore, I also know that if Nina gives a report, it must be on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, Choice B (Nina gives a report on Monday) and Choice C (Nina gives a report on Tuesday) are both possible.\n\nHowever, I also know that George must give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Choice D (Olivia gives a report on Monday) can be eliminated.\n\nFinally, I know that Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day if Nina gives a report on Monday. Therefore, Choice A (Helen gives a report on Wednesday) can be eliminated.\n\nBased on my reflection and the given choices, the only possible answer is Choice B (Nina gives a report on Monday).\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
