T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.\n2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.\n3. O is performed either first or fifth.\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n5. P is performed at some time before S.\n6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know T cannot be performed second, fourth, or sixth, as it would violate the condition of being performed immediately before or after F or R.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that there must be at least two compositions performed between F and R, or between R and F. This means P cannot be performed third, as there would only be one composition between F and R.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know O can be performed either first or fifth. If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed second, as there would be no composition between F and R. If O is performed fifth, then P cannot be performed fourth, as there would only be one composition between R and F.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that L or H must be performed eighth. If L is performed eighth, then P cannot be performed seventh, as there would only be one composition between R and F. If H is performed eighth, then P cannot be performed sixth, as there would only be one composition between F and R.\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that P must be performed before S. This means P cannot be performed seventh, as S would be performed before P.\n\nFrom condition 6, we know that at least one composition must be performed after O and before S, or after S and before O. If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed second, as there would be no composition after O and before S. If O is performed fifth, then P cannot be performed fourth, as there would only be one composition after S and before O.\n\nConsidering all the conditions, we can see that P cannot be performed second, third, fourth, sixth, or seventh. Therefore, the only possible position for P is fifth.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
