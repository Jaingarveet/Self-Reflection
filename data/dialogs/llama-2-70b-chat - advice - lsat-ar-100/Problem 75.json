Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, Megregian cannot review only Sunset, as that would mean she reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez.\n\nFrom condition 2, we know that Jiang does not review Tamerlane, since Kramer and O'Neill both review it. Thus, Jiang can only review Sunset and Undulation.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. O'Neill cannot review Sunset, as that would mean he reviews the same play as Kramer, which contradicts condition 4. Therefore, O'Neill must review Undulation.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that exactly two students review the same play or plays. Since Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, the only remaining student who can review Sunset is Lopez.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA: Lopez - Correct. Lopez reviews only Sunset.\nB: O'Neill - Incorrect. O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nC: Jiang, Lopez - Incorrect. Jiang reviews Sunset and Undulation.\nD: Kramer, O'Neill - Incorrect. Kramer reviews Tamerlane, and O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nE: Lopez, Megregian - Incorrect. Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
