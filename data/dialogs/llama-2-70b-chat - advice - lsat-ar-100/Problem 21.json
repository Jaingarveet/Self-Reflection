The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nIf Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then we can deduce the following:\n1. Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, as per constraint 3.\n2. Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela, as per constraint 1.\n3. If Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen, as per constraint 1.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Jaramillo and Landon\nJaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela, so this choice is incorrect.\n\nB: Jaramillo and Novetzke\nJaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela, and Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen, so this choice is incorrect.\n\nC: Kayne and Landon\nKayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, and Landon must be assigned to Zambia, so this choice is correct.\n\nD: Kayne and Novetzke\nKayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, and Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen, so this choice is incorrect.\n\nE: Landon and Novetzke\nLandon must be assigned to Zambia, and Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen, so this choice is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Kayne and Landon.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
