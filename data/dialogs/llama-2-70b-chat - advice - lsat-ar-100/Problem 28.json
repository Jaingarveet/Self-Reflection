If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\n3. F and K cannot both be selected.\n4. K and M cannot both be selected.\n5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nGiven that four scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, we must find the fifth scientist who satisfies all the conditions.\nLet's consider each choice:\nA. G: If G is selected, then we have two botanists, which violates condition 2. Therefore, A is incorrect.\nB. H: If H is selected, then we have two botanists, which violates condition 2. Therefore, B is incorrect.\nC. K: If K is selected, then we have two chemists, which violates condition 1. Therefore, C is incorrect.\nD. M: If M is selected, then we must select P and R, which means we have two zoologists, violating condition 2. Therefore, D is incorrect.\nE. P: If P is selected, then we have two zoologists, which violates condition 2. Therefore, E is incorrect.\nNow, let's use a systematic approach to find the fifth scientist. We know that F, L, Q, and R are selected. We need one more scientist to satisfy all the conditions. We cannot select a botanist or a zoologist, as we already have one of each. Therefore, the only option left is a chemist.\nThe only chemist left is K. Therefore, the fifth scientist selected must be K.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
