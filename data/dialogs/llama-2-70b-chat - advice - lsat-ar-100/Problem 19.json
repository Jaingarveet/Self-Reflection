Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Here's my reflection on the problem:\n\nThe problem states that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. The question asks what must be true if Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports.\n\nMy initial answer was choice A: Helen gives a report on Monday. However, upon reflection, I realized that this answer is not necessarily true. Even if Helen gives a report on Monday, it's possible that Kyle and Lenore give their reports on Tuesday and Wednesday morning, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be choice B: Irving gives a report on Monday. Since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, it means that Irving must give a report on Monday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
