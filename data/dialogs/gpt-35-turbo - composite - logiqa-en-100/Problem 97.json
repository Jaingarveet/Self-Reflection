However, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it weakens the argument by questioning the credibility of the online forum that made the statistical comparison.

Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion and the evidence used to support it.\n3.

Choose the answer choice that weakens the argument the most.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Identify the conclusion and the evidence used to support it.\n - Evaluate each answer choice and determine whether it strengthens or weakens the argument.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or do not address the argument.\n - Choose the answer choice that weakens the argument the most.\n"

The evidence used to support the argument is that posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people have increased by 90%. Option B, which states that the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, could be an alternative explanation for the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people.

Option D, which states that the online forum is a legal forum, does not address the argument. Option A, which states that \"Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles.\" Throughout the ages, is a general statement that does not address the argument. Therefore, option B is the answer because it weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people. If the increase in the number of internet users is the main reason for the increase in such posts, then the social atmosphere may not be rapidly deteriorating.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
