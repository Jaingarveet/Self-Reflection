At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose answer [REDACTED], which is incorrect. \nXiao Wang did not disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument. Instead, Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument was lacking in persuasion.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the argument\n - Misinterpreting the refutation\n - Misreading the question\nSolution:\nXiao Chen believes that the flickering light emitted by Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before when the comet is far from the sun.\nXiao Wang refutes this by pointing out that normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun, and the flickering light was observed through continuous and careful tracking observation.\nXiao Wang's method of refutation is to point out the weakness in Xiao Chen's argument, which is lacking in persuasion.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the key arguments made by each person.\n3. Identify the method of refutation used by each person.\n4. Choose the answer that most accurately summarizes the method of refutation used by Xiao Wang.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the key arguments made by each person.\n - Always identify the method of refutation used by each person.\n - Always choose the answer that most accurately summarizes the method of refutation used.\n - Never misinterpret the refutation or the argument.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
