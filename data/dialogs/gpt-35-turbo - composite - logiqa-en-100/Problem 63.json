However, the passage does not mention anything about buying stocks or funds. Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it mentions that private lending is active and the interest on lending is much higher than the bank deposit interest rate. This suggests that residents may be withdrawing their savings from banks and investing in private lending to earn higher interest rates.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of answer choices\n - Lack of attention to details\n - Incorrect assumption\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is option [REDACTED] because it mentions private lending, which is a possible alternative investment option for residents to earn higher interest rates. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the relevant information in the passage.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice carefully and eliminate irrelevant or incorrect options.\n4. Choose the answer that best explains the flow of most of the 100 billion yuan savings funds based on the information in the passage.\n5.
