(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\nQuestion: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?\nChoices:\n  A: Tang Xiaohua\n  B: Peng Youwen\n  C: Qiu Zhijie\n  D: Song Wenkai\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the requirements. \nI only considered the requirement that [REDACTED] cannot be selected with [REDACTED]. \nHowever, there is another requirement that Guo Yanran and [REDACTED] cannot be selected at the same time. \nTherefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. \nSince [REDACTED] cannot be selected, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of requirements\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Ignoring a requirement\nSolution:\nIf He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. \nFrom the requirements, we know that [REDACTED] cannot be selected with Guo Yanran or [REDACTED]. \nAlso, Guo Yanran and [REDACTED] cannot be selected at the same time. \nTherefore, the only person who cannot be selected is [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the requirements carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the constraints and limitations.\n3. Consider all the requirements and constraints.\n4. Analyze the problem systematically.\n5. Identify the possible scenarios.\n6. Eliminate the impossible scenarios.\n7. Choose the correct answer based on the remaining scenarios.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the requirements carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always consider all the requirements and constraints.\n - Always analyze the problem systematically.\n - Always identify the possible scenarios.\n - Always eliminate the impossible scenarios.\n - Always choose the correct answer based on the remaining scenarios.\n"
