Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n3. Consider all possible outcomes based on the given information.\n4. Choose the answer that must be true based on the given information.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n - Always think through all possible outcomes based on the given information.\n - Never assume any information that is not explicitly stated.\n - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that a conditional statement is not equivalent to its contrapositive.\n"
