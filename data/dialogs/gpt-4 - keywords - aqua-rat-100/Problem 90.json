The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:\n1*x*6 (cost of newspapers from Monday to Saturday) + 4*2x (cost of newspapers on Sunday) = 210\nSolving this equation will give us the value of x.\nAction: \nFirst, simplify the equation: 6x + 8x = 210\nThen, combine like terms: 14x = 210\nFinally, solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 14: x = 210 / 14 = 15\nAnswer(\"A\")"
