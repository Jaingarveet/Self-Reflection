        "content": "Thought: \nFirst, I need to find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy. \nFor alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40 = 16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40 = 24 grams.\nFor alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60 = 23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60 = 36.67 grams.\nThen, I add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z. The total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams.\nFinally, I find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing the total amount of zinc by the total amount of copper. The ratio is 39.33:60.67, which simplifies to approximately 59:91 when rounded to the nearest whole number.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
