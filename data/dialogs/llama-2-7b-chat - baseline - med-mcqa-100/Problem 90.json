These anomalies can lead to a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, which can cause the fetus to lie in an unstable position. Other possible causes of an unstable lie at this gestational age include placenta previa or oligohydramnios. However, pelvic tumors are less common and are unlikely to cause this symptom at this stage of pregnancy."
