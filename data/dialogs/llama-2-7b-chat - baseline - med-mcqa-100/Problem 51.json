An increase in transferrin saturation (TIBC) and serum ferritin levels, along with a Transferrin ferritin index >1, are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.\n\nChoices (A) and (B) are incorrect because they do not meet the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia. Choice (D) is also incorrect because it does not specify the level of Transferrin ferritin index."
