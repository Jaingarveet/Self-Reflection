It is the drug of choice for treating hyperthyroidism during pregnancy due to its better safety profile compared to other options like propylthiouracil and I121. While propylthiouracil can cross the placenta and may affect fetal growth, I121 is a radioactive iodine that can cause fetal radiation exposure. Methimazole, on the other hand, has a better safety profile and has been used in pregnant women without any significant adverse effects on the fetus."
