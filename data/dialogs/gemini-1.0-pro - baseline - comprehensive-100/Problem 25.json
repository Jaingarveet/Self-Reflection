The toy store and the shoe store can be in any order in spaces 3, 4, and 5. This arrangement satisfies all the constraints.\n- If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the veterinarian must be in space 6, the optometrist must be in space 2, and the restaurants must be in spaces 3, 4, and 5. The toy store and the shoe store can be in any order in spaces 3, 4, and 5.
