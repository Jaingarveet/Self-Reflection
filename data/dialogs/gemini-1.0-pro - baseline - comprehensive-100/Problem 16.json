Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not all tall.\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n* Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, but we don't know if they are tall or handsome.\n* Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, but we don't know if they are tall, handsome, or doctors.\n* Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, so one of them must be tall and the other must not be tall.\nSince we know that there are 3 tall men, and Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, then either Liu Dawei or Li Qiang must be tall.\nNow, let's consider the information about the handsome man. We know that there is only 1 handsome man among the 4 men. Since Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, they cannot be the handsome man. This leaves Liu Dawei and Li Qiang as possibilities for the handsome man.\nTherefore, the only man who can meet all of Li Na's requirements is the one who is tall, handsome, and a doctor. Based on the information we have, this man can only be **Liu Dawei**.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
