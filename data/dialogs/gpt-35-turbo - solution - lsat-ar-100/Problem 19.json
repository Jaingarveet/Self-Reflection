Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nIf Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports.\nGeorge can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give the morning or afternoon report on Tuesday.\nNeither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports.\nTherefore, Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday, but not both.\n"
