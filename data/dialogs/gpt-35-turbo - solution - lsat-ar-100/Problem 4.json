Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

However, Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Therefore, Olivia must lead a Friday session, and Lan must lead a Thursday session. \nNessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session. \nJulio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday. \nIf Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, then they must lead sessions on Thursday or Friday. However, Rebecca cannot lead a Thursday session because Lan is leading a Thursday session. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead Friday sessions. \nSo, the lab assistants leading Thursday sessions are Lan and Julio. \nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
