        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nIf Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Tamerlane and one other play. \nKramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so they must review only one play each. \nSince neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang cannot review Sunset or Tamerlane. \nTherefore, Jiang must review Undulation. \nIf Kramer and Lopez each review only one play, and neither of them reviews Sunset or Tamerlane, then they must review Tamerlane and Undulation in some order. \nTherefore, O'Neill must review Sunset, and Megregian must review Sunset and Tamerlane. \nThus, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n"
