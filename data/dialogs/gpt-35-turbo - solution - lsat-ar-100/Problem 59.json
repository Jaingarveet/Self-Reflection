The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: P CANNOT be performed\nChoices:\n  A: second\n  B: third\n  C: fourth\n  D: sixth\n  E: seventh\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe know that P is performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] position because S is performed after P. If P is performed in the [REDACTED] position, then S must be performed in the eighth position, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the [REDACTED] position. The only remaining option is the fifth position, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the fifth position.\n"
