Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina\n  B: Lenore, George, and Irving\n  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore\n  D: Robert, George, and Irving\n  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Tuesday. Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. \nIf Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, then George must give the morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, George cannot give the morning report on Monday or Wednesday. \nIf Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, then Nina cannot give the morning report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give the morning report on Monday or Tuesday. \nIf Nina gives the morning report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. \nIf Nina gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Robert and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. \nTherefore, the list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be [REDACTED].\n"
