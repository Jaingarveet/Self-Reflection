        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated \"out of print.\" Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.\nQuestion: If the scenario descrthed in the first two paragraphs were to become true, then which one of the following would most likely be the case?\nChoices:\n  A: The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books.\n  B: The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly.\n  C: Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers.\n  D: There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.\n  E: The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly.\n"

This seems plausible.\nB) The passage doesn't discuss used books. It's focused on the printing of new books on demand. There's not enough information to conclude patronage of used bookstores would increase significantly.\nC) The passage suggests upstart digital publishing firms would bid for manuscripts first, not that most publishers would sell books individually without distributors or retailers. \nD) While digital publishing would reduce certain costs, the passage doesn't indicate less demand for copy editors or book designers. Manuscripts would still need to be edited and book layouts designed.\nE) If books are printed on demand from digital files, the overall demand for book-grade paper may not necessarily decrease, as copies are still being printed, just at the point of sale.\nConsidering the information provided, choice A seems most likely. Printing on demand would shift warehousing needs from storing individual books to storing the paper and materials needed to print and bind books at the point of sale.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
