        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as \"literature\" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nQuestion: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?\nChoices:\n  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.\n  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.\n  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.\n  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.\n  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.\n"

        "content": "To determine which choice would most call into question the author's assertion in lines 11-16, let's first identify that assertion:\nThe author asserts that while many African American writers have used music and musicians as themes and metaphors in their writing, Toni Morrison was the first to use a musical genre (jazz) as the structuring principle for an entire novel in her 1992 work Jazz.\nNow let's examine each choice:\nA) This choice supports the author's assertion by stating that Morrison intentionally simulated jazz performance style in Jazz. It does not call the assertion into question.\nB) If a small number of African American novelists had based their work on blues music structure earlier in the 20th century, it would contradict the author's claim that Morrison was the first to use a musical genre as a novel's structuring principle. This choice could call the assertion into question.\nC) This is a broad generalization about all novels dealing with arts and artists. It does not specifically address African American writers or the use of musical genres as structural principles, so it does not directly challenge the author's assertion.\nD) The idea that any novel can be considered musical to some degree is a broad claim that does not specifically address the author's assertion about African American writers and the use of musical genres as structural principles.\nE) The relative number of African American writers versus non-African American writers who have written music-themed novels does not affect the author's specific assertion about the groundbreaking nature of Morrison's use of jazz as a structural principle in her novel.\nThe choice that would most call into question the author's assertion is B, as it suggests Morrison may not have been the first African American author to use a musical genre as a novel's structuring principle.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
