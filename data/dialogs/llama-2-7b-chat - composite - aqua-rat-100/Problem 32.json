How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?\nChoices:\n  A: 1\n  B: 240\n  C: 30\n  D: 60\n  E: 120\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the problem and calculated the time incorrectly. I thought the problem was asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles, but it was actually asking for the time it would take to travel a distance of 48 miles divided by the speed of the cyclist.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the problem\n* Calculation error\n* Division error\n\nSolution:\nThe correct solution is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 48 miles / [REDACTED]2 miles/hour = 4 hours\n\nInstructions:\n\n[REDACTED]. Identify the distance and speed given in the problem.\n2. Divide the distance by the speed to find the time.\n3. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.\n* Always break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that division is the inverse operation of multiplication, so when dividing a number by another number, you are essentially multiplying by the reciprocal of the divisor.\n"
