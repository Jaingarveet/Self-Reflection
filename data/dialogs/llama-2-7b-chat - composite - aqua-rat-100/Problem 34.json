I calculated the percentage of profit and loss incorrectly.\n\nThe correct calculation for the percentage of profit and loss is as follows:\n\nProfit = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price\n= (25.75 - 27.50) / 27.50\n= 5% Profit\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Profit and loss calculation\n* Percentage calculation\n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the selling price and cost price of the book.\n2. Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.\n3. Calculate the percentage of profit and loss by dividing the profit by the cost price and multiplying by 100.\n4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the percentage of profit and loss is calculated by multiplying the profit by 100.\n"
