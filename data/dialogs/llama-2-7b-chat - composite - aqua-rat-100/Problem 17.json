What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I reflected on my solution and the correct answer, and I understand now that the minimum selling price per component to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.\n\nHere is my thought process:\n\n* I calculated the total production cost for the year as 420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800.\n* I subtracted the production cost from the revenue from sales to calculate the yearly profit: $626,400 - $46,800 = $580,600.\n* To ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the minimum selling price per component must be greater than or equal to $580,600 / 420 units = $1,387 per component.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) $240."
