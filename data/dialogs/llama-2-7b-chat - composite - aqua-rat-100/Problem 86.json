I incorrectly calculated the marked price of the watch.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Arithmetic error\n* Percentage error\n\nSolution:\nTo calculate the marked price of the watch, we need to use the formula: Marked price = Rs. 15 / (1 - profit percentage).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the profit percentage earned by the shopkeeper. The problem states that if the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. So, the profit percentage = 7% = 0.07.\n\nNow, we can calculate the marked price of the watch:\nMarked price = Rs. 15 / (1 - 0.07) = Rs. 15 / 0.93 = Rs. 16.28\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].\n\nExplanation:\nThe marked price of the watch is Rs. 16.28.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the marked price of a product is the price at which it is sold, taking into account any discounts or profits."
