At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 months\n  B: 4 months\n  C: 23 months\n  D: 24 months\n  E: 84 months\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nGreat job on answering the question correctly! Your reasoning and approach are spot on. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and how you arrived at the correct answer:\n\n1. You correctly identified the key information in the question: [REDACTED] started the business with Rs.40,000, [REDACTED] joined [REDACTED] after [REDACTED] started, and [REDACTED] joined after some more time.\n2. You recognized that C's share of the profit was Rs.150,000, which means that the total profit at the end of the year was Rs.375,000.\n3. You correctly deduced that [REDACTED] joined the business [REDACTED] after [REDACTED] started, and then you assumed that [REDACTED] joined the business [REDACTED] after [REDACTED] joined.\n4. You used the information provided to calculate the time period between [REDACTED] starting the business and [REDACTED] joining, which is 8 months.\n5. You correctly identified the answer as (E) 8[REDACTED].\n\nWell done!

I started by reading the question carefully and identifying the key information: A started a business with Rs.40,000, B joined after 2 months with Rs.60,000, and C joined after some more time with Rs.120,000.\n2. I then realized that the total profit at the end of the year was Rs.375,000, and C's share of the profit was Rs.150,000.\n3. I deduced that B joined the business 4 months after A started, as there are 2 months between A starting the business and B joining.\n4. I then calculated the time period between B joining and C joining, which is 8 months.\n5. Finally, I selected the answer (E) 8 months, as it was the only option that matched the information provided in the question.\n\nI hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with."
