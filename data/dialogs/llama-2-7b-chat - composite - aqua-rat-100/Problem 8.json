The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512. Find the train fare between the two places for one person?\nChoices:\n  A: 126\n  B: 77\n  C: 88\n  D: 66\n  E: 54\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nGreat job on breaking down the problem step by step! However, there is a small mistake in your calculation.\n\nYou calculated the bus fare as follows:\n\nBus fare = Total fare / Number of persons\n= 1512 / 6\n= 252\n\nBut, you forgot to take into account the fact that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. So, the correct calculation for the bus fare is:\n\nBus fare = (4/3) × Train fare\n= (4/3) × 189\n= 252\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].\n\nHere's a summary of the steps you can follow to solve this problem:\n\n1. Analyze the problem step by step.\n2. Identify the given information and the question being asked.\n3. Use the given information to calculate the train fare for one person.\n4. Use the train fare to calculate the bus fare for one person.\n5. Check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nRemember, always double-check your work and use the correct mathematical concepts to solve problems.
