How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 10\n  C: 5\n  D: 15\n  E: 20\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI miscounted the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 points of a regular pentagon. I thought there were only [REDACTED] quadrilaterals possible, but there are actually 1[REDACTED].\n\nThe error in my thinking was that I limited the number of quadrilaterals to [REDACTED], when in fact there are many more possibilities. I should have considered all the possible combinations of 2 points from each side of the pentagon to form a quadrilateral.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Miscounting\n* Limited thinking\n* Incorrect reasoning\n\nSolution:\nTo form a quadrilateral by joining 4 points of a regular pentagon, we need to choose 2 points from the same side of the pentagon. There are [REDACTED] sides in a regular pentagon, so we can choose 2 points from each side to form [REDACTED] quadrilaterals.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the regular pentagon with [REDACTED] sides.\n2. Choose 2 points from each side of the pentagon to form a quadrilateral.\n3. Count the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed in this way.\n4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always consider all the possible combinations of points to form a quadrilateral.\n* Don't limit your thinking to a small number of possibilities.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is directly proportional to the number of points chosen from each side of the pentagon.\n"
