Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly as B: 3/2. However, upon further reflection, I realized my mistake. The correct answer is E: 25/3.\n\nError Keywords:\n* Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls.\n* Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do.\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to set up a proportion. We know that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls, so we can set up the proportion:\n\n6 pita breads : 2 rolls = x baguettes : 5 baguettes\n\nWhere x is the number of baguettes that contain the same amount of falafel as one roll.\n\nWe also know that three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do, so we can set up another proportion:\n\n3 rolls : 5 baguettes = x baguettes : 25 baguettes\n\nWhere x is the number of baguettes that contain the same amount of falafel as one pita bread.\n\nNow, we can use the two proportions to find the value of x. We know that two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as one pita bread, so we can set up the equation:\n\n2 baguettes : 1 pita bread = x baguettes : 25 baguettes\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 25/3\n\nTherefore, the answer is E: 25/3.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving proportions, it's important to use the information given in the problem to set up the correct proportion. In this case, we used the information that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls, and three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. By using these proportions, we were able to find the value of x and determine the correct answer."
