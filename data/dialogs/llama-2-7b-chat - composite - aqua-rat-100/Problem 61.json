Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information given in the problem and calculated the distance incorrectly. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer the question correctly this time.\n\nError Keywords:\n* Misunderstood the information given in the problem\n* Calculated the distance incorrectly\n\nSolution:\nTo find the distance between A and B, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.\nWe know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph for the entire trip, so the distance he traveled can be calculated as:\ndistance = 70 x 3 = 210 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is 210 miles.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving a problem, it's important to read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In this case, I misunderstood the information given in the problem and calculated the distance incorrectly. To avoid making the same mistake, I will make sure to read the question carefully and double-check my calculations.\n\nAnswer: (C) 210 miles"
