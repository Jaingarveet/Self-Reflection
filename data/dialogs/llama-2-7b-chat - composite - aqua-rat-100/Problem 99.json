Find P(A/B)?\n\nReflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution is:\n\nP(A/B) = P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo find P(A/B), we need to divide the probability of A by the probability of B. Since A and B are independent events, we can use the formula:\n\nP(A/B) = P(A) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, so we can plug these values into the formula to get:\n\nP(A/B) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving probability problems, it's important to carefully read the question and understand the requirements. In this case, we needed to divide the probability of A by the probability of B, which can be a tricky concept to grasp. Take your time and make sure you understand the problem before starting to solve it."
