If the area of each of the triangles is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the perimeter of the original square cloth was 56 feet. Upon further reflection, I realized that my mistake was in not properly calculating the perimeter of the rectangular piece that was formed after trimming the square cloth.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the rectangular piece, I need to add the lengths of all four sides. The length of each side is half the length of the original square cloth, which is 4 feet. Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is:\n\nPerimeter = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 feet\n\nSo, the perimeter of the original square cloth was 16 feet. The correct answer is (B) 58 feet.\n\nAdvice: When solving problems, it is important to carefully read and understand the question, and to double-check your work to ensure that you have arrived at the correct answer. In this case, I made a mistake by not properly calculating the perimeter of the rectangular piece, which led to an incorrect answer."
