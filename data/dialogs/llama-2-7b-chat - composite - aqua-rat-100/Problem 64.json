Now I am 60 years old, how old is my brother?\nChoices:\n  A: A)59\n  B: B)69\n  C: C)79\n  D: D)89\n  E: E)99\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a calculation error in my answer. I incorrectly calculated the age of the brother.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Time passage error\nSolution:\nWhen the person was 2 years old, their brother was half their age, which means their brother was 2 years old.\nNow, 60 years have passed, and the person is 60 + 2 = 62 years old.\nSo, their brother is now 62 - 2 = 60 years old.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the age of the person when their brother was half their age.\n2. Calculate the number of years that have passed since the person was 2 years old.\n3. Subtract the number of years that have passed from the current age of the person to find the age of the brother.\n4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the passage of time can affect the age of individuals, so be sure to account for it in your calculations.\n"

Identify the age of the person when their brother was half their age:\nThe person was 2 years old when their brother was half their age.\nSo, the person's age at that time = 2.\n\n2. Calculate the number of years that have passed since the person was 2 years old:\nNow, the person is 60 years old, and they were 2 years old 60 - 2 = 58 years ago.\n\n3. Subtract the number of years that have passed from the current age of the person to find the age of the brother:\nThe brother's age = 60 - 58 = 2 years old.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) 69 years old.\n\nExplanation:\nWe calculated the age of the brother by subtracting the number of years that have passed since the person was 2 years old from the current age of the person. Since 60 - 58 = 2 years have passed, the brother is now 2 years old."
