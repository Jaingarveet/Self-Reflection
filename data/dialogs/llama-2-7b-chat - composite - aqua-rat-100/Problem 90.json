If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. Here is my self-reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Twice as many papers on Sunday as on the rest of the days\n* Total number of papers ordered per week\n\nSolution:\nTo find the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, we need to use the information that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days, the total number of papers ordered per week is:\n\n2 x (Sunday papers + Monday papers + Tuesday papers + ... + Friday papers) = 2 x (Sunday papers + Monday papers + ... + Friday papers)\n\nWe know that the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 on the rest of the days, so the total cost of the newspapers ordered per week is:\n\nTotal cost = (Sunday papers x $4) + (Monday papers x $1) + ... + (Friday papers x $1)\n\nWe also know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the following equation:\n\nTotal cost = $210\n\nSolving for the number of papers ordered on Monday, we get:\n\nMonday papers = Total cost / ($4 + $1)\nMonday papers = $210 / ($4 + $1)\nMonday papers = 52.5\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a paper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 53 newspapers.\n\nTherefore, the hotel buys 53 newspapers on Monday.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving a problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the given information, and to identify any keywords or phrases that can help guide your solution. In this problem, the key phrase \"twice as many papers on Sunday\" helped us to determine the total number of papers ordered per week. Additionally, it is important to check your work and reflect on your solution to ensure that it is correct."
