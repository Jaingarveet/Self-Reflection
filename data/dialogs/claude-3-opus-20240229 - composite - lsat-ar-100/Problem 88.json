        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly determined that Choice [REDACTED] fully specified the shelf placement for all books, when in fact Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer. My error was in not carefully considering all possible arrangements for each choice. I jumped to a conclusion with Choice [REDACTED] without fully analyzing the constraints.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Hasty generalization\n - Failure to consider all possibilities\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n- K is on a higher shelf than F.\n- O is on a higher shelf than L.\n- F and M are on the same shelf.\nChoice [REDACTED]: I and M are on the same shelf (middle).\n- I and M are on the middle shelf.\n- F must also be on the middle shelf (same as M).\n- K must be on the top shelf (higher than F).\n- O must be on the top shelf (higher than L).\n- This leaves G, H, and L for the bottom shelf.\n- Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top, G, H, and L must all be on the bottom shelf.\nTherefore, the arrangement is fully determined:\nTop: K, O\nMiddle: F, I, M\nBottom: G, H, L\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the given conditions and constraints.\n2. Consider each answer choice one at a time.\n3. For each choice, try to deduce the shelf placement for each book based on the given information and the new condition in the choice.\n4. If a choice leads to multiple possible arrangements, eliminate it and move to the next choice.\n5. If a choice uniquely determines the shelf placement for all books while satisfying all conditions, select it as the answer.\n6. Double-check the selected answer by confirming it is the only choice that fully determines the arrangement.\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully read and understand all given information and constraints in a logic problem.\n - Consider each possibility systematically and thoroughly; don't jump to conclusions.\n - Eliminate choices that lead to multiple possible arrangements.\n - Select the choice that uniquely determines the solution while satisfying all conditions.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure it is fully consistent with the given information.\n"
