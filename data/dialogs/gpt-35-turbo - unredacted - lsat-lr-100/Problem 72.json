        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Seemingly inconsequential changes in sea temperature due to global warming eventually result in declines in fish and seabird populations. A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata. This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton. Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton?\nChoices:\n  A: It is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients.\n  B: It is intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits.\n  C: It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly.\n  D: It is offered as one reason that global warming must be curtailed.\n  E: It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the role of the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton. \nThe statement is not intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits, but rather to help show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Misunderstanding\n - Misreading\nSolution:\nThe statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton is used to explain the importance of phytoplankton in the food chain. \nThe argument explains how global warming affects the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton, which in turn affects the food chain. \nSince zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton, the decline in phytoplankton populations will eventually lead to declines in zooplankton populations and the rest of the food chain. \nTherefore, the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the role played by the statement in question.\n3. Consider the context of the argument and how the statement relates to it.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately describe the role played by the statement.\n5. Choose the answer that best describes the role played by the statement.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Pay close attention to the context of the argument and how each statement relates to it.\n - Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately describe the role played by the statement.\n - Choose the answer that best describes the role played by the statement.\n"
