However, among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest. Since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all.\nQuestion: A reasoning error in the argument is that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances\n  B: treats the fact of someone's presence at a given event as a guarantee that that person had a legitimate reason to be at that event\n  C: uses a term that is intrinsically evaluative as though that term was purely descriptive\n  D: fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people\n  E: overlooks the possibility that a person's interest in one kind of thing is compatible with that person's interest in a different kind of thing\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in identifying the reasoning error in the argument. \nThe argument fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people.\nThe argument assumes that since Hana received the recording, her brothers must have been present at the party. However, this is not necessarily true, as someone else could have given the recording to Hana.\nError Keywords:\n - False assumption\n - Unestablished premise\n - Logical fallacy\nSolution:\nThe argument fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people.\nThe argument assumes that since Hana received the recording, her brothers must have been present at the party. However, this is not necessarily true, as someone else could have given the recording to Hana.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the reasoning error in the argument.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice carefully.\n4. Choose the answer that best describes the reasoning error in the argument.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Always evaluate each answer choice carefully.\n - Always eliminate answer choices that are clearly incorrect.\n - Always choose the answer that best describes the reasoning error in the argument.\n - Remember that logical fallacies are common in arguments and can be identified with practice.\n"
