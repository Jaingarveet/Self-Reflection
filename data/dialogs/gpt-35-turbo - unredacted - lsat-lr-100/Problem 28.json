Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly chose option E as the answer, which weakens the argument. However, option C is the correct answer, which weakens the argument. \nOption E is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the issue of whether violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town. \nOption C weakens the argument by stating that more people are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities. This means that the increase in the number of calls involving violent crimes may not necessarily indicate an actual increase in violent crime, but rather an increase in reporting. \nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the argument\n - Incorrectly choosing an answer\n - Not paying attention to the details\nSolution:\nThe argument is that violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town, and the local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes compared to last year. \nOption A is irrelevant to the argument.\nOption B is also irrelevant to the argument.\nOption C weakens the argument by stating that more people are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\nOption D is irrelevant to the argument.\nOption E is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the issue of whether violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion and the evidence supporting it.\n3. Evaluate each option carefully.\n4. Eliminate irrelevant options.\n5. Choose the option that weakens the argument the most.\n6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Pay attention to the details in the argument and the options.\n - Evaluate each option carefully and eliminate irrelevant options.\n - Choose the option that weakens the argument the most.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
