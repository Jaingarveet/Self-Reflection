This can be seen from the fact that those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit in that they strive to develop commercially viable technology.\nQuestion: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\nChoices:\n  A: contains a premise that cannot possibly be true\n  B: takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable\n  C: fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain\n  D: takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome\n  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose answer choice B, which is incorrect. The argument does not assume that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable. Instead, it claims that those responsible for technological advances are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. \nThe correct answer is D because the argument assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is not necessarily true, as people may unintentionally produce outcomes that they did not desire. \nError Keywords:\n - False assumption\n - Misinterpretation\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nThe argument claims that technological innovation is rarely in the interest of society as a whole because those responsible for it are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. This assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is not necessarily true, as people may unintentionally produce outcomes that they did not desire. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion and premises of the argument.\n3. Evaluate the assumptions made in the argument.\n4. Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples.\n5. Choose the answer that best identifies a flaw in the argument.\n6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Identify the conclusion and premises of the argument.\n - Evaluate the assumptions made in the argument.\n - Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples.\n - Choose the answer that best identifies a flaw in the argument.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that logical reasoning requires careful evaluation of assumptions and evidence.\n"
