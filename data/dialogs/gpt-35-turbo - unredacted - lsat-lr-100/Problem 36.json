This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.\n  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.\n  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.\n  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.\n  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly chose option C as the assumption on which the argument depends. The correct answer is E. The argument is that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The assumption on which the argument depends is that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are more accurate than the perceptions of persons who do not know that language. Option E correctly captures this assumption. \nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the argument\n - Incorrectly identifying the assumption\n - Not paying attention to the details of the argument\nSolution:\nThe argument is that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The assumption on which the argument depends is that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are more accurate than the perceptions of persons who do not know that language. Option E correctly captures this assumption. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n3. Identify the evidence used to support the conclusion.\n4. Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.\n5. Evaluate each option against the assumption.\n6. Choose the option that correctly captures the assumption.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Pay close attention to the details of the argument.\n - Identify the conclusion, evidence, and assumption of the argument.\n - Evaluate each option against the assumption.\n - Choose the option that correctly captures the assumption.\n"
