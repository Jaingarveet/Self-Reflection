        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that actionâ€”as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.\n  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.\n  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.\n  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.\n  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly chose option B as the answer. Option B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. However, this assumption does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn because it does not support the idea that Tolstoy's claim is rash. The correct answer is option C, which states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. This assumption enables the conclusion to be properly drawn because it supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. If we do not regard an action as freely performed, then we cannot praise or blame a person for that action, regardless of how much information we possess about the events that led to it.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the assumption\n - Incorrectly choosing an answer that does not support the conclusion\n - Misinterpreting the question\nSolution:\nThe argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim is rash. We need to find an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn. The correct answer is option C, which states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n3. Identify the assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.\n4. Evaluate each option carefully.\n5. Choose the option that supports the conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n - Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n - Identify the assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.\n - Evaluate each option carefully.\n - Choose the option that supports the conclusion.\n - Be careful not to misinterpret the question or the options.\n"
