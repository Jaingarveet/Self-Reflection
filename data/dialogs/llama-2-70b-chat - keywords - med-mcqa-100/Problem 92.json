It arises from the superior temporal branch of the external carotid artery and supplies the dura mater of the cerebral hemisphere.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) External carotid artery.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous response, I made an anatomy error by selecting the wrong branching pattern. I mistakenly chose (D) Middle cerebral artery, which is not a direct branch of the external carotid artery. Instead, the middle meningeal artery arises from the superior temporal branch of the external carotid artery. I will be more careful in my selection and ensure that I accurately identify the branching patterns of arteries in the future."
