Kaagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the respiratory and digestive systems. It is characterized by ciliary dyskinesia, which is the inability of cilia to move in a coordinated manner, leading to respiratory infections and other complications.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"D: Situs inversus.\" Situs inversus is a condition where the organs in the chest and abdomen are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. It is not a feature of Kaagener's syndrome.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
