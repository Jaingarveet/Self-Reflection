After reflecting on the question, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of knowledge about the term \"liver shrinkage diet.\" I was not familiar with this term and its association with surgery.\n\nThe \"liver shrinkage diet\" is actually a preoperative preparation for patients undergoing liver resection surgery.
