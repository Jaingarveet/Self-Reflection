I mistakenly believed that the autoantibodies in the salt split skin technique bound to BP antigen 1 & 2, which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is B: Epiligrin. In cicatricial pemphigoid, IgG autoantibodies target the epidermal basement membrane zone, specifically the epiligrin protein. The salt split skin technique is used to detect the presence of these autoantibodies, and it involves splitting the skin into two layers, followed by separation of the epidermal and dermal layers. The epidermal side of the split skin is then incubated with patient's serum, and the presence of IgG autoantibodies is detected by immunofluorescence staining.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Epiligrin, as it is the target antigen of the autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid that is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
