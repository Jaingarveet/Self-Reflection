Let's analyze the question again.\nWhich antithyroid drug can be safely used in pregnancy?\nThe key here is to identify the antithyroid drug with the best safety profile during pregnancy, particularly regarding congenital malformations.\nA: Propylthiouracil has been associated with congenital malformations, including aplastic anemia and choanal atresia. Therefore, it is not the best option for pregnant women.\nB: I121 is not a commonly used antithyroid drug, and its safety profile during pregnancy is not well established. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.\nC: Methimazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, with a low risk of congenital malformations. However, it can cause neonatal thyroid suppression and transient hypothyroidism in the newborn.\nD: Carbimazole is the preferred antithyroid drug during pregnancy, as it has a better safety profile than other options. Although it can also cause neonatal thyroid suppression, the risk is lower compared to methimazole.\nReflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I overlooked the importance of the safety profile during pregnancy. Now, I have reevaluated the options, and my answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
