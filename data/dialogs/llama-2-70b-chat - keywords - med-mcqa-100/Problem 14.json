I seem to have confused the end products of glycolysis with those of cellular respiration.\n\nAnaerobic glycolysis is the process by which glucose is converted into energy in the absence of oxygen. The end product of this process is 2 ATP and 2 NADH.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI will make sure to differentiate between the end products of glycolysis and cellular respiration in the future. Additionally, I will review the steps and end products of each metabolic process to avoid confusion."
