        "content": "  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the options again:\n\nA. Oligohydramnios: This is a condition where there is a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. While it can cause fetal distress and other complications, it's not typically associated with an unstable lie.\n\nB. Placenta previa: This is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. It can cause bleeding during pregnancy and delivery, but it doesn't typically cause an unstable lie.\n\nC. Pelvic tumor: This is a rare condition that can cause an unstable lie, but it's not a common cause.\n\nD. Uterine anomalies: This is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries. Uterine anomalies can cause the fetus to shift and change position, leading to an unstable lie.\n\nReflecting on my previous answer, I overlooked the possibility of uterine anomalies as the cause of an unstable lie. I misjudged the likelihood of this option, thinking it was less common than it actually is.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
