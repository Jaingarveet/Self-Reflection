I misunderstood the question and answered incorrectly.\nIn pharmacology, the drug that affects the trabecular meshwork and aqueous outflow is Pilocarpine.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nPilocarpine is a parasympathomimetic agent that works by increasing the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, which stimulates the contraction of the ciliary muscles and increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork.\n\nTimolol, Brimonidine, and Brinzolamide are all beta-blockers that reduce aqueous production but do not directly affect the trabecular meshwork.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Pilocarpine."
