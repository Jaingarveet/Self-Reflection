At least one person of Bingding is selected.\n2. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected.\n3. A maximum of 2 people are selected.\nThe rules apply to the final selection of four, not the initial identification of five candidates.\nTherefore, Ding must be in the fourth because of rule 1 (at least one person of Bingding is selected).\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the rules and their scope of application.\n2. Identify the key information and constraints.\n3. Analyze the choices systematically, considering all rules and constraints.\n4. Eliminate choices that violate any rule or constraint.\n5. Choose the answer that satisfies all rules and constraints.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of the rules and their scope of application.\n - Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that violate any rule.\n - Be systematic and thorough in your analysis.\n - Double-check your reasoning and conclusions before making a final decision.\n"
