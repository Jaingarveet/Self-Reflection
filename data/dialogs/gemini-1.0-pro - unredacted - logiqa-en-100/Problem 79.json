Carefully read the argument and identify its main claim.\n2. Analyze each option to determine whether it supports, weakens, or is irrelevant to the argument.\n3. Be cautious of options that appear to support the argument but actually strengthen it.\n4. Consider the implications of each option in relation to the main claim of the argument.\n5. Choose the option that most clearly constitutes doubt or rebuttal to the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.\n - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how each option interacts with it.\n - Be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.\n - Remember that the goal is to identify the option that casts doubt on or refutes the argument, not necessarily the option that is most obviously wrong.\n"
