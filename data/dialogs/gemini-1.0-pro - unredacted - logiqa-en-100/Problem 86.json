Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, which means there is no station between them.\n2. Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and West of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station, which means Fuyi Station is next to Huyao Station and on the east side of Huyao Station.\n3. Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station, which means there is no station between them.\n4. Based on the above information, we can conclude that Huyao Station is on the east side.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and understand the context.\n2. Identify the relative positions of the stations mentioned in the question.\n3. Pay attention to the keywords that indicate the relative positions, such as \"east of\", \"west of\", \"adjacent to\".\n4. Do not make assumptions about the positions of stations based on incomplete information.\n5. Consider all possible scenarios based on the given information.\n6. Choose the answer that is consistent with all the information provided.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the context.\n - Pay attention to the keywords that indicate the relative positions of objects.\n - Do not make assumptions about the positions of objects based on incomplete information.\n - Consider all possible scenarios based on the given information.\n - Choose the answer that is consistent with all the information provided.\n - Draw a diagram or sketch to visualize the relative positions of the objects, if necessary.\n"
