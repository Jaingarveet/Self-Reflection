Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n2. Identify the premises of the argument.\n3. Determine whether the premises support the conclusion.\n4. If the premises do not support the conclusion, identify the unstated assumption that is necessary for the argument to be valid.\n5. Evaluate the validity of the argument based on the unstated assumption.\nAdvice:\n - Always be on the lookout for unstated assumptions.\n - Unstated assumptions can often be the most important part of an argument.\n - If you can identify the unstated assumptions of an argument, you will be in a better position to evaluate its validity.\n - Be aware of the different types of logical fallacies.\n - A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid.\n - By being aware of the different types of logical fallacies, you will be better able to identify them and avoid making them yourself.\n"
