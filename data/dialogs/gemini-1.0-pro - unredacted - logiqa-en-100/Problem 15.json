Carefully read the premises and identify the evidence they provide.\n2. Consider the conclusion and determine whether the evidence provided by the premises is sufficient to guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n3. If the evidence is sufficient, then the conclusion must be true.\n4. If the evidence is not sufficient, then the conclusion is only likely to be true, but it may also be false.\n5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Be aware of the difference between certainty and probability.\n - Do not overgeneralize from the evidence provided by the premises.\n - Consider alternative possibilities, even if they are unlikely.\n - Choose the answer that accurately reflects the level of uncertainty associated with the conclusion.\n"
