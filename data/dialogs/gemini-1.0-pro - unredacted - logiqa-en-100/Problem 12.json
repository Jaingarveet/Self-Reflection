The conclusion explicitly states that image thinking helps achieve breakthroughs, implying that Nobel Prize winners, who have achieved breakthroughs, must have used image thinking more.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Focus on method instead of outcome**\n* **Misinterpreting the causal relationship**\n* **Ignoring explicit statements in the context**\n## Solution:\n1. Identify the conclusion: Image thinking methods help achieve major scientific breakthroughs.\n2. Identify the evidence: Nobel Prize winners make more use of image thinking methods than general scientists.\n3. Analyze the relationship: The evidence suggests that Nobel Prize winners, who have achieved breakthroughs, use image thinking more.\n4. Identify the assumption: The conclusion assumes that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully read the conclusion and identify the main point.\n2. Analyze the evidence provided and its connection to the conclusion.\n3. Look for the underlying assumption that links the evidence to the conclusion.\n4. Choose the answer that explicitly states the assumed connection.\n## General Advice:\n* Pay close attention to the wording of the conclusion and the evidence.\n* Distinguish between methods, outcomes, and the relationships between them.\n* Identify the missing link that connects the evidence to the conclusion.\n* Look for the answer that explicitly states the assumed connection.\n* Avoid focusing on irrelevant details or making unwarranted assumptions.\n"
