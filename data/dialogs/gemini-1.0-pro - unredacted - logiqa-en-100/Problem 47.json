Identify the key information in the statement:\n    - Listed companies with dividends can issue new stocks.\n    - Companies with dividends do not need funds.\n2. Analyze the implications of the statement:\n    - Companies with dividends would not issue new stocks unless they need funds.\n3. Consider the question:\n    - Which of the following statements cannot be false?\n4. Evaluate each choice:\n    - A: A listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends. This could be false if the company has dividends but needs financing.\n    - B: A listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends. This cannot be false because the statement allows for companies without dividends to need financing.\n    - C: A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends. This could be false if the company has dividends and needs to issue new stocks.\n    - D: The only way for a listed company to finance is to issue new stocks. This could be false if the company has other ways to finance, such as debt.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the statement and its implications.\n2. Identify the key information and analyze its meaning.\n3. Consider the question and what it is asking.\n4. Evaluate each choice systematically and identify which one cannot be false based on the statement.\n5. Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the information provided.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of the statement and its implications.\n- Break down complex statements into smaller, more manageable parts.\n- Consider all possibilities and eliminate choices that are not logically consistent with the statement.\n- Do not rush to conclusions; take your time to analyze the information thoroughly.\n- Be mindful of making assumptions that are not supported by the evidence.\n"
