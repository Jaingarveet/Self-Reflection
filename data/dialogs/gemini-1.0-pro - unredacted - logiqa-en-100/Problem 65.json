Identify the inconsistency between the survey results and the expert belief.\n2. Consider possible explanations for the inconsistency.\n3. Look for evidence that supports or refutes the expert belief.\n4. Choose the option that provides the most helpful explanation for the inconsistency.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider multiple perspectives and interpretations.\n - Be aware of the limitations of survey results and expert opinions.\n - Look for evidence that supports or refutes your assumptions.\n - Choose the option that provides the most logical and consistent explanation.\n"
