I calculated the train fare for one person to be Rs. 96, but that was not one of the available choices.\n\nThought:\nLet's denote the train fare for one person as x.\nAccording to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.\nThe total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512.\nSo, we can write the equation: 6 \\* (4/3)x + 8x = 1512\nSolving this equation will give us the value of x.\n\nAction:\nFirst, let's simplify the equation: 8x + 8x = 1512\nCombining like terms, we get 16x = 1512\nNow, dividing both sides by 16, we get x = 94.5\nHowever, none of the given choices match this value. There seems to be an error in the problem or the provided choices.\n\nSince I am required to select one of the available choices, I will choose the closest value to my calculated answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") (The closest value to 94.5 is 88)"
