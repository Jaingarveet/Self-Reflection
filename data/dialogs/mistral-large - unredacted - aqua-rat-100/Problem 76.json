Simplify the expression for x.\n2. Multiply the conjugate of the denominator to the numerator and denominator.\n3. Simplify the expression.\n4. Substitute the minimum and maximum values of n to find the range of x.\n5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that canceling out common factors is only valid when the entire expression is a factor of both the numerator and denominator.\n - Always multiply the conjugate of the denominator to the numerator and denominator when simplifying expressions with square roots.\n"
