If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss ?\nChoices:\n  A: 2% Profit\n  B: 3% Profit\n  C: 2% Loss\n  D: 3% Loss\n  E: 4% Loss\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nReflection:\n\n1. Why I answered incorrectly:\nI made a calculation error when finding the cost price of the book. I divided the selling price by (1 + 10/100) instead of (1 - 10/100). This resulted in an incorrect cost price, which led to an incorrect percentage of loss.\n2. Error keywords:\n   - Calculation error\n   - Arithmetic error\n   - Division error\n3. Correct solution:\n   - Find the cost price of the book: Rs 27.50 / (1 - 10/100) = Rs 250/9\n   - Calculate the loss if the book were sold for Rs 25.75: Rs 250/9 - Rs 25.75 = Rs 0.25\n   - Calculate the percentage of loss: (Rs 0.25 / Rs 250/9) x 100 = 3%\n   - The correct answer is \"B: 3% Loss.\"\n4. Instructions for future reference:\n   - Carefully read the question and understand the problem.\n   - Identify the given values and the required calculations.\n   - Double-check your calculations, especially when performing arithmetic operations.\n   - Verify that your answer matches one of the given choices.\n5. General advice:\n   - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n   - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n   - Be cautious when performing arithmetic operations, especially division.\n   - Verify that your answer matches one of the given choices before selecting an option.\n"
