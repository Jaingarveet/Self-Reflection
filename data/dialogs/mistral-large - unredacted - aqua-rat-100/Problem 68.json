If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\nChoices:\n  A: 242\n  B: 308\n  C: 352\n  D: 412\n  E: 456\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning when I assumed that the other integer must be a factor of 700.\nThe gap in my knowledge was in understanding the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.\nI knew the correct GCF and one of the integers but made an incorrect assumption about the other integer.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misunderstanding of GCF and LCM relationship\n - Misinterpretation of the problem\n\nSolution:\nThe greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11.\nOne of the integers is 350.\nSince 11 is a prime number, the other integer must also be divisible by 11.\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700.\nSince 7700 = 11 x 700, the other integer must be a factor of 7700.\nLet's check each of the answer choices to see which one is a factor of 7700 and is also divisible by 11.\n\nA: 242 is divisible by 11, and it is a factor of 7700 (7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 11).\nB: 308 is divisible by 11, but it is not a factor of 7700.\nC: 352 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.\nD: 412 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.\nE: 456 is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two integers.\n2. Identify one of the integers.\n3. Determine the prime factors of the GCF.\n4. Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the two integers.\n5. Determine the prime factors of the LCM.\n6. Check each of the answer choices to see which one is a factor of the LCM and is also divisible by the prime factors of the GCF.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the GCF and LCM of two integers are related but not the same.\n - Remember that the other integer must be a factor of the LCM and must also be divisible by the prime factors of the GCF.\n"
