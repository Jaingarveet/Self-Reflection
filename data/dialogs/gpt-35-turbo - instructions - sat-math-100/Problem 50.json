Therefore, we can set up two equations:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Left-handed students: } & \\text{Female: } 1f + 1m = 18 \\\\\n& \\text{Male: } 1f + 1m = 0 \\\\\n\\text{Right-handed students: } & \\text{Female: } 5f + 0m = 5x \\\\\n& \\text{Male: } 0f + 9m = 122\n\\end{align*}\nWe can solve for $m$ in the fourth equation: $9m = 122 \\Rightarrow m = \\frac{122}{9}$. We can substitute this value into the second equation to solve for $f$: $1f + 1\\left(\\frac{122}{9}\\right) = 0 \\Rightarrow f = -\\frac{122}{9}$. This is not a valid solution, so we made a mistake somewhere. We can check our work by solving for $x$ in the fourth equation: $5f + 0m = 5x \\Rightarrow 5f = 5x \\Rightarrow f = x$. This means that the number of right-handed female students is equal to the number of left-handed female students. We can use this information to solve for $f$ in the first equation: $1f + 1m = 18 \\Rightarrow f + \\frac{122}{9} = 18 \\Rightarrow f = \\frac{40}{3}$. Now we can find the total number of female students: $f + \\frac{122}{9} = \\frac{40}{3} + \\frac{122}{9} = \\frac{218}{9}$. Finally, we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female: $\\frac{5f}{5f + 9m} = \\frac{5\\left(\\frac{40}{3}\\right)}{5\\left(\\frac{40}{3}\\right) + 9\\left(\\frac{122}{9}\\right)} = \\frac{40}{218} \\approx 0.1835$. The answer closest to this value is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }0.357}$. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
