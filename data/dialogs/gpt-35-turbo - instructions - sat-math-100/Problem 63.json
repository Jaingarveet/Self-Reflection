Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?\nChoices:\n  A: $300=30 w-60$\n  B: $300=30 w$\n  C: $300=30 w+60$\n  D: $300=60 w-30$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the initial payment and weekly payment amounts.\n2. Identify the total cost of the television.\n3. Write an equation that relates the total cost of the television to the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.\n4. Solve the equation for the unknown variable.\n5.

Let $w$ be the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase. The total cost of the television is equal to the sum of the initial payment and the weekly payments. Therefore, we can write the equation: $300=60+30w$.\n4. Solving for $w$, we get $w=\\frac{240}{30}=8$.\n5. Double-checking, we see that $60+30(8)=300$, so our answer is correct.\n6. Answer(\"C\") $300=30w+60$"
