To find the number of messages sent by Tyrone, I multiplied the number of messages he sent each hour by the number of hours he sent messages: $p \\cdot 4 = 4p$. Then, I added the number of messages sent by each person together: $5m + 4p$. However, I did not choose the correct answer choice. \nTo find the total number of messages sent by both Armand and Tyrone, I need to add the number of messages sent by Armand and the number of messages sent by Tyrone: $5m + 4p$. Therefore, the correct answer is C: $5m+4p$. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
