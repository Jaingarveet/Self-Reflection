The reciprocal of $\\frac{3}{5}$ is $\\frac{5}{3}$.\n4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $\\frac{5}{3}$ gives us $\\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} w=\\frac{5}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}$, which simplifies to $w=\\frac{20}{9}$.\n5. We simplified both sides of the equation by canceling out the common factors of 3 and 5.\n6. We solved for $w$ and got $w=\\frac{20}{9}$.\n7.
