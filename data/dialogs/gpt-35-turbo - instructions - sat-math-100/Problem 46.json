The mean is sensitive to outliers, while the median and range are not. To calculate the mean, we sum all the values and divide by the number of values. To calculate the median, we arrange the values in order and find the middle value. To calculate the range, we subtract the smallest value from the largest value. \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
