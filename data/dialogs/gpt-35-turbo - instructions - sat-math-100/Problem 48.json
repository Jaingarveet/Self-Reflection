I can do this by subtracting $3x$ from both sides of the first equation and subtracting $3y$ from both sides of the second equation.\n3. This gives me $b=-4x+7$ and $c=-2y+7$.\n4. Substituting these expressions for $b$ and $c$ into the given equations, I get $-x=-\\frac{15}{2}$ and $-2y=-\\frac{15}{2}$.\n5. Solving for $x$ and $y$, I get $x=\\frac{15}{2}$ and $y=\\frac{15}{4}$.\n6. Calculating $x-y$, I get $\\frac{15}{2}-\\frac{15}{4}=\\frac{15}{4}$.\n7.
