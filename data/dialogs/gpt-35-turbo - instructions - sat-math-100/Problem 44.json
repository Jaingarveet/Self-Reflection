Ten students each mark off a randomly selected region of the field; each region is square and has side lengths of 1 meter, and no two regions overlap. The students count the earthworms contained in the soil to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in each region. The results are shown in the table below.\\begin{center}\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\\hlineRegion & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Number of } \\\\ \\text { earthworms }\\end{array}$ & Region & $\\begin{array}{c}\\text { Number of } \\\\ \\text { earthworms }\\end{array}$ \\\\\\hlineA & 107 & $\\mathrm{~F}$ & 141 \\\\\\hlineB & 147 & $\\mathrm{G}$ & 150 \\\\\\hlineC & 146 & $\\mathrm{H}$ & 154 \\\\\\hlineD & 135 & $\\mathrm{I}$ & 176 \\\\\\hlineE & 149 & $\\mathrm{~J}$ & 166 \\\\\\hline\\end{tabular}\\end{center}Which of the following is a reasonable approximation of the number of earthworms to a depth of 5 centimeters beneath the ground's surface in the entire field?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\quad 150$\n  B: $\\quad 1,500$\n  C: 15,000\n  D: 150,000\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the area of the entire field.\n2. Identify the area of each region.\n3. Count the number of regions.\n4. Calculate the total number of earthworms in all regions.\n5. Divide the total number of earthworms by the number of regions to find the average number of earthworms per region.\n6. Multiply the average number of earthworms per region by the total number of regions to find the total number of earthworms in the entire field.\n7. Round the answer to the nearest reasonable approximation.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"
