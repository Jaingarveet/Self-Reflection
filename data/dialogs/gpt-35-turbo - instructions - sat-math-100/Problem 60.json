        "content": "Thought:\nLet's assign the unknown variable to the number of students in the class.\nFrom the problem, we know that if each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, there will be 5 milliliters left over. This can be represented as:\n$n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{3}$\nwhere $n$ is the total amount of solution in milliliters.\nWe also know that if each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl will need an additional 21 milliliters. This can be represented as:\n$n + 21 = 4s$\nwhere $s$ is the number of students in the class.\nWe can use the first equation to solve for $n$ in terms of $s$:\n$n = 3k + 5$\nwhere $k$ is some integer.\nSubstituting this into the second equation, we get:\n$3k + 5 + 21 = 4s$\n$3k + 26 = 4s$\n$4s - 3k = 26$\nWe can see that $s$ must be greater than or equal to 7, since Mr. Kohl needs at least 21 additional milliliters of solution to give each student 4 milliliters. We can also see that $s$ must be less than or equal to 26, since Mr. Kohl has only $n$ milliliters of solution to distribute.\nWe can use trial and error to find a value of $s$ that satisfies the equation. Starting with $s = 7$, we get:\n$4s - 3k = 26$\n$4(7) - 3k = 26$\n$28 - 3k = 26$\n$3k = 2$\n$k = \\frac{2}{3}$\nThis is not an integer value of $k$, so $s = 7$ does not work. Trying $s = 8$, we get:\n$4s - 3k = 26$\n$4(8) - 3k = 26$\n$32 - 3k = 26$\n$3k = 6$\n$k = 2$\nThis is an integer value of $k$, so $s = 8$ works. Therefore, there are 8 students in the class.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
