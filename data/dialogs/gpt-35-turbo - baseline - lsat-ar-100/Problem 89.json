Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\n"

Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Wednesday. \nIf the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday as well, which violates the first condition. \nIf the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday. \nTherefore, the only possible option is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
