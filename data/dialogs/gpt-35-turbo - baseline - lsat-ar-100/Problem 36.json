Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.\n  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.\n  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.\n"
