Therefore, R cannot be third. Eliminate D and E.\n- S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, S cannot be third. Eliminate C.\n- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, if Q is third, then S must be second. This means that Q cannot be second. Eliminate A.\n- This leaves us with B: H is second. This is possible because H is not part of the finance or nutrition articles, and it is not specified that H cannot be consecutive to any of the other articles. Therefore, Answer(\"B\")."
