Read the question carefully to understand what specific information it is asking for.\n2. Review the defining characteristics of mixtures, compounds, and other classifications of matter.\n3. Examine each component of the mixture and consider whether it retains its original properties or if those properties have changed.\n4.

These are all different substances that have been combined together.\n2. In a mixture, the components retain their individual chemical properties. They are not chemically bonded or combined. \n3. If we examine each component - the peanuts are still peanuts, the raisins are still raisins, etc. Each substance has kept its original properties and identity.\n4. The components are just physically mixed together, not chemically bonded. You could theoretically separate out the individual peanuts, raisins, chocolate pieces, etc.\n5. The key defining characteristic of a mixture is that it contains more than one substance, and those substances keep their original properties when combined. They are not chemically altered.\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\nThe snack is a mixture because it is made up of more than one substance. The individual components retain their distinct properties and identities when combined together."
