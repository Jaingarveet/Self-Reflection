Volume values for each choice:\n   A: 2 m^3 of bricks\n   B: 4 m^3 of bricks \n   C: 6000 m^3 of air\n   D: 10,000 m^3 of air\n3. Calculate mass for each choice using mass = density × volume:\n   A: 2000 kg/m^3 × 2 m^3 = 4000 kg\n   B: 2000 kg/m^3 × 4 m^3 = 8000 kg\n   C: 1 kg/m^3 × 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg  \n   D: 1 kg/m^3 × 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg\n4. The smallest calculated mass is 4000 kg, which corresponds to choice A.\n5. Therefore, the choice with the lowest mass is A: 2 m^3 of bricks.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
