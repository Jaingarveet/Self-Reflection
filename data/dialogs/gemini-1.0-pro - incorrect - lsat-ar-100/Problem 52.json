Therefore, Garcia must be on Monday, leaving Franco for Tuesday.\nTherefore, the only possible schedule that satisfies all conditions is:\n* **Monday:** Garcia\n* **Tuesday:** Franco, Hong\n* **Wednesday:** Iturbe, Jackson\nThis schedule also fulfills the condition that Garcia and Hong do not testify on the same day.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\") \n"
