        "content": "Let's analyze each statement:\n* **A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.** This statement must be true. Since there are three kinds of cookies and each kind has three batches, there must be at least one batch made each day to fulfill the condition of no two batches of the same kind being made on the same day.\n* **B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.** This statement could be false. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch on Tuesday, and the third batch on Wednesday, then only one batch of cookies would be made on Wednesday (the third batch of oatmeal cookies).\n* **C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.** This statement could be false. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch on Tuesday, and the third batch on Wednesday, then two batches of cookies would be made on Monday (the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies).\n* **D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.** This statement could be true. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch on Tuesday, and the third batch on Wednesday, then two batches of cookies would be made on Tuesday (the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of sugar cookies).\n* **E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.** This statement could be false. If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then two batches of cookies would be made on Friday (the third batch of sugar cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies).\nTherefore, the only statement that could be false is **B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.**\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
