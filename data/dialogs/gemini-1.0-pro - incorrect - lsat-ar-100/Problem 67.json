        "content": "Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:\n1. **Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).** This means a total of 9 batches are made each week.\n2. **No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.** This implies that each day, one batch of each kind of cookie is made.\n3. **At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.** This eliminates the possibility of no batches being made on Monday.\n4. **The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.** This means either both are made on Monday or Tuesday or both are made on Thursday or Friday.\n5. **The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.** This eliminates the possibility of the second batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies being made on Thursday. Therefore, they must be made on Monday or Tuesday.\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\nA. **Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.** This could be true if the second batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.\nB. **Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.** This could be true if the second batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Monday.\nC. **At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.** This is guaranteed as at least one batch is made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made either on Monday or Tuesday.\nD. **At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.** This is guaranteed as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and at least one more batch (either the first batch of sugar cookies or the second batch of oatmeal/peanut butter cookies) must be made on Thursday.\nE. **Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.** This could be true if the second batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is:\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")**"
