Therefore, grain must be in bay 6.\n* **Fuel:** Since produce has a higher number than fuel, fuel cannot be in bay 5 or 6 (occupied by textiles and grain). Therefore, fuel must be in bay 1 or 2.\n## Determining Cargo:\n* **Bay 1:** We know it's either fuel or machinery.\n* **Bay 2:** We know it's either fuel or machinery.\n* **Bay 3:** We know it's textiles.\n* **Bay 4:** We know it's produce.\n* **Bay 5:** We know it's textiles.\n* **Bay 6:** We know it's grain.\n## Conclusion:\nWe have completely determined the cargo for four bays: textiles (bay 3 and 5), produce (bay 4), and grain (bay 6). \n## Action: Answer(\"D\") \n"
