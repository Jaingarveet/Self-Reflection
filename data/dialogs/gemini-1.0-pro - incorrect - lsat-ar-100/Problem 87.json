Since the minimum number of works is already 3, the organizer must select at least 2 more works.\nLooking at the choices, only option E, two Russian novels, satisfies the minimum requirements:\n- **French novels:** 3 (minimum)\n- **Russian novels:** 2 (minimum)\n- **French plays:** 0 (minimum)\n- **Russian play:** 0 (minimum)\nTherefore, the organizer must at least select two Russian novels.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
