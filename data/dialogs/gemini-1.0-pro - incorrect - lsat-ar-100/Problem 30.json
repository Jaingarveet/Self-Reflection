Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

This means the other option must be true for the fifth solo (Wayne performs a modern piece OR Zara performs a traditional piece).\n3. **Second and fifth solo:** The pianist who performs the second solo does NOT perform the fifth solo. This eliminates some possibilities depending on the first solo.\n## Analyzing the answer choices:\n**A: Zara performs the first solo:** This could be true, but we need more information to confirm.\n**B: Wayne performs the third solo:** This could be true, but we need more information to confirm.\n**C: Zara performs the fifth solo:** This could be true, but we need more information to confirm.\n**D: The second solo is a traditional piece:** This is NOT necessarily true. If Zara performs the first and second solos, both could be modern pieces.\n**E: The fourth solo is a modern piece:** This is NOT necessarily true. If Wayne performs the third and fourth solos, both could be traditional pieces.\n## Reaching a conclusion:\nWe need more information about the first solo to determine which statement must be true. \nTherefore, the answer is: **None of the above**. \n"
