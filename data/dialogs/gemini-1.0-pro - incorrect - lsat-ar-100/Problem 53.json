Therefore, the answer is **None of the Above**. \n## Reflection:\nIn my previous attempt, I focused on individual rules without considering the overall possibilities. This led to an incorrect conclusion. By systematically analyzing the rules and applying them to each house, I was able to identify that none of the choices are necessarily true. \n"
