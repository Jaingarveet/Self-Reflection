The argument assumes that the overabundance of algae is the cause of the deaths of smaller fish, without considering other potential factors that may be contributing to the problem. For example, there may be a separate factor, such as a change in water temperature or a lack of oxygen, that is causing the deaths of smaller fish, and the overabundance of algae may simply be a coincidence.\n\nThe correct answer is D."
