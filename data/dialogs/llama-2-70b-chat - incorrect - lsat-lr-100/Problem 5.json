        "content": "  Answer: E\n\nThe correct answer is E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.\n\nThis answer resolves the apparent discrepancy by suggesting that the increase in recorded tornadoes is due to an increase in detection rather than an actual increase in the number of tornadoes. This means that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes have not changed, but the ability to detect and report tornadoes has improved, leading to a higher number of recorded tornadoes.\n\nThe other choices do not resolve the discrepancy. Choice A suggests that meteorologists did not understand the factors affecting tornado creation before 1953, but this does not explain why the number of recorded tornadoes has increased. Choice B suggests that the intensity of tornadoes has increased, but this does not address the discrepancy between the number of tornadoes recorded and the climatic factors. Choice C suggests that the number of recorded tornadoes has only increased slightly in the last five years, but this does not explain the overall increase in recorded tornadoes since 1953. Choice D suggests that the amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown, but this does not address the discrepancy between the number of tornadoes recorded and the climatic factors."
