Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?\nChoices:\n  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.\n  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.\n  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.\n  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.\n  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, I can give you a hint: the correct answer is choice B. There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers. This statement helps to explain why television executives are not primarily focused on maximizing the number of viewers for their shows, unlike movie executives. Movie theaters make a significant profit from selling snacks and drinks to moviegoers, which is not a factor in television. Therefore, television executives focus more on attracting a specific audience demographic that appeals to sponsors, who are concerned with the purchasing power of the viewers."
