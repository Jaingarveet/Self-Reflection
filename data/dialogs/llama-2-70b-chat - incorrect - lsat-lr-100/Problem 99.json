However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "  The correct answer is E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\n\nThe professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary. This implies that thinkers need to be able to control their thoughts and ideas in order to fully explore their implications. Without intellectual discipline, thinkers may lack the ability to focus their thoughts and ideas, which would hinder their ability to make intellectual progress. Therefore, option E logically follows from the professor's argument.\n\nIt's worth noting that the other options do not logically follow from the professor's argument. Option A is not necessarily true, as thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy may still be able to make intellectual progress within that framework. Option B is also not necessarily true, as thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas in a society that does not value intellectual progress. Option C is actually the opposite of what the professor argues, as the professor suggests that freedom of thought is necessary for intellectual progress, but that it is not sufficient without intellectual discipline. Option D is also not related to the professor's argument."
