Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Since there's no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on the given information.\n\nThe correct answer is E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\n\nThis answer choice weakens the argument because it suggests that the increase in reported violent crimes may not necessarily indicate a worsening crime problem, but rather a result of a few repeat offenders committing multiple crimes. This information implies that the root cause of the problem might not be the increasing number of victims but rather the lack of effective measures to address the repeat offenders. Therefore, choice E most seriously weakens the argument.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
