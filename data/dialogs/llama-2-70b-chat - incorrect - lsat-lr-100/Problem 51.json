However, I can give you some guidance on how to approach the question.\n\nThe political scientist's argument suggests that people become unenthusiastic about voting because they believe that important problems cannot be addressed by government action. The argument assumes that people's beliefs about the effectiveness of government action are the sole cause of decreasing voter turnout.\n\nThe vulnerable spot in the argument can be found in choice A: \"presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action.\"\n\nThe argument does not consider other possible reasons for decreasing voter turnout, such as voter suppression, political disillusionment, or a lack of engagement with the political process. By assuming that the belief in the ineffectiveness of government action is the sole cause of decreasing voter turnout, the argument ignores other potential factors that may contribute to this trend. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
