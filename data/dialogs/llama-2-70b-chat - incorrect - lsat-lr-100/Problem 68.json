        "content": "  Answer: B\n\nThe fact that there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog is useful in evaluating the argument because it suggests that the high number of cocker spaniels found in the area is not just due to the breed being more prone to straying, but rather that there is a higher concentration of cocker spaniels in the area overall. This increases the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.\n\nIt is not necessary to know whether cocker spaniels are more likely to stray than other breeds (A), as the argument is based on the number of registered dogs in Flynn Heights, not their likelihood of straying. The number of stray dogs found in Flynn Heights compared to other neighborhoods (C) is also not relevant to the argument. The per capita number of pets owned by residents of Flynn Heights (D) may be interesting, but it does not directly relate to the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. Finally, the licensing habits of residents of Flynn Heights (E) may be relevant, but the argument does not rely on this information."
