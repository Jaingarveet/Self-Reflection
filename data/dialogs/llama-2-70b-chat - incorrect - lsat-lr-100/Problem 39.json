So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.\n  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.\n  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.\n  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.\n  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "  I'm sorry, but since there is no reflection information provided, I cannot help you answer this question using your self-reflection. However, I can give you a hint: the correct answer is choice A. Rossi's argument appeals to the general principle of democracy, which holds that all individuals who will be affected by a government's decisions should have a say in that government. Rossi argues that children's interests are not always represented by their parents and therefore should have the right to vote. This argument relies on a general principle rather than evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal (choice C) or substituting description for a policy rationale (choice D). It also does not deny the good faith of an opponent (choice B) or employ a term in two different senses (choice E)."
