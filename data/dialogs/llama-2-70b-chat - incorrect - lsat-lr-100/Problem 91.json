Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: E\n\nThe statement that is most strongly supported by the information provided is:\n\"There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\"\n\nThe passage explains that people who are allergic to cats are allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva, and that these proteins vary from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, which means that any given cat has the potential to cause an allergic reaction in any allergy sufferer. Therefore, it is not possible to predict whether a particular cat will produce an allergic reaction in a specific individual.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about different breeds of cats causing different allergic reactions.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because, while it is true that not all cats are capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, the passage states that all cats have the potential to cause an allergic reaction in some people.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because, while it is true that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, the passage does not suggest that this variation is the reason why some cats cause allergic reactions in some people and not in others.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the intensity of allergic reactions varying between different allergy sufferers."
