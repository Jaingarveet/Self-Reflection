        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: E\n\nThe principle illustrated by the argument is that if one party has engaged in illegal activity, they cannot justifiably take punitive measures against another party who has also engaged in illegal activity, even if the latter party has admitted their guilt.\n\nThe best illustration of this principle is choice E. Ramirez was forced to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs, but the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against her because they have pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties in the past. This is similar to the original argument, where the company cannot justifiably take punitive measures against Ellison because they obtained the evidence against him through illegal means.\n\nIn choice A, Long is not justified in stealing from Price, even though Price has admitted to stealing from Long, because two wrongs do not make a right. However, this choice does not illustrate the principle of the argument, which is about the inability to take punitive measures due to one's own illegal actions.\n\nIn choice B, Shakila would not be justified in reporting her secretary for illegally receiving cable television because she herself had done the same thing in the past. This choice also illustrates the principle of the argument, but it is not the best illustration.\n\nIn choice C, Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her for sneaking out because Takashi, who revealed her whereabouts, had violated the local curfew for minors on Monday. This choice does not illustrate the principle of the argument, as Takashi's violation of the curfew does not prevent Sarah's parents from taking punitive measures against her for her own actions.\n\nIn choice D, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner for setting illegal animal traps because she was trespassing at the time. This choice does not illustrate the principle of the argument, as the conservation officer's trespassing does not prevent her from taking punitive measures against Kuttner for his illegal actions."
