Therefore, this choice cannot be true.\n\nB: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.\n\nThis choice is also too broad, as it doesn't account for the fact that the museum store sells prints of works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.\n\nC: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n\nThis choice is incorrect, as the museum store sells prints of works that are not displayed in the museum, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.\n\nD: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.\n\nThis choice is incorrect, as Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum from a private collector. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.\n\nE: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\n\nThis choice is true, as the museum store sells prints of Hopper's Nighthawks, which is not displayed in the museum. Therefore, this choice must be true.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\n\nI hope this helps you answer the question. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know."
