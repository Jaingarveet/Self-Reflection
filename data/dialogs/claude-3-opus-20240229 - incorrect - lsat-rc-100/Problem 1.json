        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.\nQuestion: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?\nChoices:\n  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies\n  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires\n  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture\n  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values\n  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The third paragraph discusses critics of the second version of multicultural education. These critics argue that using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.\n2. The critics believe that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of that culture itself, which are often non-scientific. \n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) This study compares moral codes but doesn't specify the methods used, so it's unclear if the critics would object.\nB) Using a culture's own literature to understand its values aligns with the critics' view, so they likely wouldn't object.\nC) This directly describes what the critics are objecting to - using Western scientific methods to study a non-scientific culture. \nD) The critics may object to imposing one culture's theories on another's literature, but it's not certain.\nE) The critics are concerned about imposing Western methods on other cultures, not the reverse, so they may not object to this.\n4. Choice C most clearly matches the kind of study the third paragraph critics would find objectionable.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
