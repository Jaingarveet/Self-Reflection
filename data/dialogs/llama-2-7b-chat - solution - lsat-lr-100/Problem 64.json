However, this reasoning assumes that the presence of hormones in the body is a necessary condition for emotional stress, which may not be the case. Therefore, the argument confuses a necessary condition for a phenomenon with a sufficient condition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C - fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument only considers the effect of tears on emotional stress and neglects the possibility that emotional stress may also influence the production of tears. This oversight undermines the argument's conclusion that crying reduces emotional stress.\n\nAdditional Insights:\nThe correct answer highlights the importance of considering the potential reverse causality between emotional stress and tear production. By acknowledging this possibility, we can better understand the complex relationship between these two phenomena."
