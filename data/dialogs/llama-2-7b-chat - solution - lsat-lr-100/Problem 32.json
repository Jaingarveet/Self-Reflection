The correct answer is (A): It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument in the editorial is based on the idea that if a political party consistently expresses the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, but then votes against increasing spending on education, it is inconsistent. This is because the party's actions do not align with their expressed views, which is the basis of the argument.\n\n(B) is not the correct answer, as it suggests that reducing spending on education in the long run is a consistent course of action, which is not the argument being made in the editorial.\n\n(C) is also not the correct answer, as it suggests that even if a goal is morally good, it does not necessarily mean that it should be pursued, which is not the argument being made in the editorial.\n\n(D) is not the correct answer, as it suggests that a consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed, which is not the argument being made in the editorial.\n\n(E) is not the correct answer, as it suggests that members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue, which is not the case in the editorial.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education."
