I mistakenly assumed that the argument was similar to a causal argument, when in fact, it was an example of a fallacy of confirmation.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes an inference based on a correlation, rather than a causal relationship. Both arguments rely on the assumption that because one event occurs frequently with another event, the first event must cause the second event. However, this is not necessarily true, as there may be other factors at play.\n\nIn the case of speeding tickets and sports cars, there may be other factors that influence the correlation between the two, such as the type of roads in the area, the presence of speed cameras, or the behavior of other drivers. Therefore, it is not accurate to conclude that driving a sports car causes speeding tickets.\n\n(A) During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints. is an example of a causal argument, where the relationship between the two events is clearly established.\n\n(B) The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter. is an example of a fallacy of exclusion, where the argument assumes that just because one event occurs, the other event must also occur.\n\n(D) Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring. is an example of a fallacy of confirmation, where the argument relies on the assumption that because one group of people share a certain trait, all members of that group must share that trait.\n\n(E) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. is an example of a causal argument, where the relationship between the two events is clearly established."
