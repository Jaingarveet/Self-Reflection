But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error.

The correct principle that justifies the reasoning above is:\n\nC: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage highlights the importance of considering the accuracy of a theory's predictions when evaluating its validity. The author argues that quantum theory's predictions have been found to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error, which warrants acceptance of the theory. This principle emphasizes the significance of evaluating a theory based on its predictions and their accuracy, rather than solely on its counterintuitive consequences.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate."
