The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.\n  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.\n  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

This weakens the argument that Grey read Jordan's book because it suggests that Grey's use of the metaphor was not influenced by Jordan's work.\n\n(A) A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor is not relevant to the argument.\n\n(C) Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience does not affect the argument.\n\n(D) Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895 is not relevant to the argument.\n\n(E) According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors is not relevant to the argument.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
