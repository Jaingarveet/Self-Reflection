However, upon further reflection, I realize that the argument actually requires the assumption that an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting. This is because the argument states that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting, and the basics of composting include understanding the difference between hot and cold composting. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting."
