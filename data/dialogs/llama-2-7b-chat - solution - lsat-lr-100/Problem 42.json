However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The argumentative technique employed in the passage is actually option B, rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question.\n\nThe passage explains that when a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. The author argues that these epithets are difficult to prove and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Instead of attacking the character of the accused, the author suggests that the accusation of unyielding can be used to appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded. This is in line with option B, which states that the argumentative technique employed is rejecting a factic on the grounds that it makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question."
