However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?\nChoices:\n  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.\n  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

The correct answer is (C) Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n\nExplanation:\nThe study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the body absorbs most of the nicotine from cigarettes, regardless of the nicotine content of the cigarettes. Therefore, option (C) is the best explanation for the finding of the nicotine study.\n\nIn contrast, options (A) and (B) are not supported by the information provided. Option (A) is incorrect because the study found that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers are identical, regardless of the nicotine content of the cigarettes they smoke. Option (B) is also incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the level of tar in cigarettes is not related to the nicotine content of the cigarettes. Finally, option (E) is incorrect because the level of nicotine in the blood of a smoker decreases steadily after taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, but this is not the explanation for the finding of the nicotine study."
