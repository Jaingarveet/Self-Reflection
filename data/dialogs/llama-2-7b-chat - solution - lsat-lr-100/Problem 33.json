Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.\n  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.\n  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.\n  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.\n  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

The correct answer is (C): No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.\n\nExplanation:\nThe physician's argument is based on the results of a single experiment that showed that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain. However, if no other experiments have been done to confirm this result, it is possible that the effect is specific to the back and does not generalize to other areas. Therefore, if there is no evidence to suggest that magnetic fields are effective at relieving pain in other areas, it undermines the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.\n\nIn contrast, options (A), (B), and (D) do not provide a strong counter to the physician's argument. Option (A) is irrelevant to the argument, as the effectiveness of a treatment is not determined by a patient's knowledge of the treatment but rather by the actual application of the treatment. Option (B) is also irrelevant, as the beliefs of physicians do not determine the effectiveness of a treatment. Option (D) is also not a strong counter, as the involvement of scientists in the design of an experiment does not necessarily determine the validity of the results. Option (E) is also not a strong counter, as the variation in causes of chronic back pain among patients does not necessarily affect the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving pain."
