After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I will provide the correct response.\n\nThe most support for the president's prediction is provided by Choice (A): Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.\n\nExplanation:\nThe president of Ditalgame predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented. This statement suggests that the success of the new copy protection feature depends on its ability to increase sales. If Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature, it is crucial that the company recoups those costs through increased sales. Choice (A) provides the most support for the president's prediction because it highlights the financial investment Ditalgame has made in the new copy protection feature and the potential impact it could have on the company's bottom line.\n\nREDACTED:\n\nI have marked Choice (B) as incorrect because it does not provide sufficient support for the president's prediction. While the market for computer games may have grown steadily, it is unclear how much of that growth Ditalgame has been able to capture. Without additional information on the company's market share, it is impossible to determine the impact of the new copy protection feature on the company's sales.\n\nI have also marked Choice (C) as incorrect because it does not make logical sense. While the copy protection feature may cause a copied game to be playable for a short time, it is unlikely that this would lead to a substantial increase in sales. Most people who copy games do not do so to enjoy them temporarily before deciding to purchase them; rather, they typically copy games to avoid paying for them altogether.\n\nFinally, I have marked Choice (D) as incorrect because it is not a relevant factor in determining the impact of the new copy protection feature on Ditalgame's sales. While Game Review Monthly may give favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, this does not directly affect the company's ability to recoup its investment in the new copy protection feature."
