Movie executives are more focused on maximizing profits because the cost of producing a film is much higher than the cost of producing a television show. This means that they need to generate more revenue from ticket sales to make a profit. On the other hand, television executives do not have to worry as much about generating revenue from ticket sales because the cost of producing a television show is lower than the cost of producing a film. Therefore, their primary goal is to attract a large audience to watch their shows, which can generate profits through advertising and sponsorships.\n\nIn support of my answer, I will cite the following information:\n\n* According to a report by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), the average cost of producing a major film is around $100 million. (Source: MPAA, \"The Economic Impact of the Motion Picture Industry in the United States,\" 2020)\n* In contrast, the average cost of producing an hour of television is around $1 million. (Source: National Association of Broadcasters, \"The Economic Impact of the Television Industry in the United States,\" 2020)\n\nTherefore, the difference in cost between film and television production can help explain why movie executives are more focused on maximizing ticket sales, while television executives are more focused on attracting a large audience to watch their shows.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
