Let the base of the tower be C.\nFrom the given information, we have:\n* Angle ACB = 60°\n* Angle AC[REDACTED] = 45°\n* Time taken to travel from [REDACTED] to B = 10 minutes\nWe can use trigonometry to relate the distances and angles:\n* In triangle ABC: tan(60°) = h/BC, so BC = h/√3\n* In triangle A[REDACTED]C: tan(45°) = h/A[REDACTED]C, so A[REDACTED]C = h\nThe distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes is A[REDACTED]B = A[REDACTED]C - BC = h - h/√3 = h(√3 - 1)/√3\nSince the speed is uniform, we can use the formula: time = distance/speed\nTime taken to reach the base (C) from B = BC/v = (h/√3) / v = h / (v√3)\nTo find the time in terms of the given 10 minutes, we can divide the time to reach C from B by the time to travel from [REDACTED] to B:\n(h / (v√3)) / (h(√3 - 1)/(v√3)) = 1 / (√3 - 1)\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply both numerator and denominator by the conjugate (√3 + 1):\n1 / (√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1) / (√3 + 1) = (√3 + 1) / 2\nTherefore, the additional time needed is (√3 + 1)/2 times the 10 minutes:\nTime = 10 * (√3 + 1)/2 = 5(√3 + 1) minutes \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
