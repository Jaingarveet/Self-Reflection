We want to find the value of $\\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.\n2) Let's try to simplify $\\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. We can rewrite 8 as $2^3$:\n   $\\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \\frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \\frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$\n3) Now we can use the given equation $3x - y = 12$. Substituting this into our expression:\n   $2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$\n4) Therefore, the value of $\\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is $2^{12}$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
