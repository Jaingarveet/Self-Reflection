        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the error keywords as a guide:\n1) $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ is a fractional exponent. A fractional exponent $a^{\\frac{m}{n}}$ is equivalent to the $n$th root of $a$ raised to the $m$th power, i.e., $({\\sqrt[n]{a}})^m$.\n2) So, $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = ({\\sqrt[4]{9}})^3$. This means we first take the 4th root of 9, then cube the result.\n3) $\\sqrt[4]{9} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{9}} = \\sqrt{3}$, because the square root of 9 is 3, and the square root of 3 is $\\sqrt{3}$.\n4) Now, we cube this result: $({\\sqrt{3}})^3 = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3}$.\n5) Looking at the choices, $3\\sqrt{3}$ is choice D.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
