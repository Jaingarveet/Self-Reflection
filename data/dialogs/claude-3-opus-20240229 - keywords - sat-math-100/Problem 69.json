        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) Alan currently drives 100 miles per week. His car gets 25 miles per gallon. So the number of gallons he uses per week is:\n   100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons\n2) At $4 per gallon, his current weekly cost is: \n   4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16\n3) Alan wants to reduce this weekly cost by $5. So his new target weekly cost is:\n   $16 - $5 = $11\n4) At the new target cost of $11 per week, and with gas at $4 per gallon, the number of gallons Alan can buy is:\n   $11 ÷ $4/gallon = 2.75 gallons\n5) Since his car gets 25 miles per gallon, with 2.75 gallons, the number of miles (m) Alan can drive is:\n   m = 2.75 gallons × 25 miles/gallon = 68.75 miles\n6) So the equation relating Alan's new target miles (m) to his current miles (100) is:\n   (4/25) × m = 100 - 68.75\n   (4/25) × m = 31.25\n   (4/25) × m = 100 - 5 × (4/25) × 100\n   (4/25) × m = 100 - 5 × 4\n   (4/25) × m = 100 - 20\n   (4/25) × m = 80\nTherefore, the correct equation is:\n(4/25) × m = 100 - 5 × (4/25) × 100\nWhich simplifies to:\n(4/25) × m = 80\nThis matches choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
