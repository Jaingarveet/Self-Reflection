The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the total number of items (plays, in this case) under consideration.\n2. Determine any definite lower or upper bounds on the number of items each person has.\n3. Consider the implications of these bounds in relation to the total number of items.\n4. Draw necessary conclusions based on these implications.\n5. Reread the question and answer choices carefully.\n6. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true based on your conclusions.\n7. Select the answer choice that must be true based on your analysis.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. There are exactly 3 plays total being reviewed: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.\n2. Bounds on number of plays reviewed by each student:\n   - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian reviews at least 2 plays.\n   - Lopez and Megregian don't review any play Jiang reviews. So Jiang reviews at most 1 play.\n   - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So they each review at least 1 play.\n3. Since Megregian reviews at least 2 out of the 3 total plays, he must review more plays than Jiang, who reviews at most 1 play.\n4. Therefore, Megregian definitely reviews more plays than Jiang.\n5. Rereading the question, it asks which statement must be true.\n6. The other answer choices are not necessarily true based on the given information:\n   - A: We don't know for sure if Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez.\n   - C, D, E: The number of plays O'Neill reviews compared to Megregian, Jiang and Kramer is not definitely determined.\n7. The only statement that must be true is B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
