        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and note all the assignment rules.\n2. Consider each employee individually and determine their possible parking spaces based on the rules.\n3. If an employee's possible spaces are limited, see if this has implications for limiting other employees' spaces further.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no further limitations can be inferred.\n5. Make a final list of each employee and their possible spaces.\n6. Count the number of employees whose possible spaces are limited to exactly [REDACTED].\n7. Select the answer choice that matches this count.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The assignment rules are:\n   - Young must have a higher space than Togowa\n   - Xu must have a higher space than Souza  \n   - Robertson must have a higher space than Young\n   - Robertson must have space #1, #2, #3, or #4\n2. Considering each employee:\n   - Robertson: limited to #1, #2, #3, or #4\n   - Souza: no direct limitations yet\n   - Togowa: no direct limitations yet\n   - Vaughn: no limitations \n   - Xu: must be higher than Souza\n   - Young: must be higher than Togowa, but lower than Robertson\n3. Implications:\n   - Since Robertson is limited to #1-4, Young must be #1, #2, or #3\n   - Since Young is higher than Togowa, Togowa must be #1 or #2\n   - No further limitations can be inferred for Souza or Xu\n4. No additional limitations found.\n5. Final possibilities:\n   - Robertson: #1, #2, #3, or #4\n   - Souza: #1, #2, #3, #4, or #5 \n   - Togowa: #1 or #2\n   - Vaughn: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6\n   - Xu: #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6\n   - Young: #1, #2, or #3\n6. Two employees (Togowa and Young) are limited to only two possible spaces.\n7. Therefore, the correct answer is B: two employees have their assignment limited to only two possible spaces.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
