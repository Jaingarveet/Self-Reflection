At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and given information.\n2. Identify the fixed positions of any books when possible.\n3. Use the given conditions to logically deduce the relative positions of the other books.\n4. Consider each shelf separately and the possible number of books on each.\n5. Eliminate answer choices that contradict the deduced arrangement.\n6. Select the answer choice that must be true based on the deductions.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. I is placed on the middle shelf. This is a fixed position.\n2. F and M are placed on the same shelf. \n   O is on a higher shelf than L.\n   K is on a higher shelf than F (and thus also higher than M).\n   \n3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. With 8 books total and at least 2 per shelf, the distribution must be either:\n   - 2 top, 2 middle, 4 bottom \n   - 2 top, 3 middle, 3 bottom\n   \n4. I is on the middle shelf. \n   F and M must be on either the top or bottom shelf.\n   O must be on either the middle or top shelf (to be higher than L). \n   K must be on either the middle or top shelf (to be higher than F).\n   \n5. Looking at the choices:\n   A) O higher than M - Possible. O can be middle/top while M is bottom.\n   B) K higher than G - Not necessarily. G could be top with K middle.\n   C) I higher than F - Possible. I is middle while F can be bottom.\n   D) G higher than O - Not necessarily. O could be top with G middle or bottom.  \n   E) F higher than L - Not necessarily. They could be on the same bottom shelf.\n6. C must be true. I is fixed in the middle while F and M are together on top or bottom. Since there are more books on the bottom than top, F and M must be on the bottom, below I.\nTherefore, the answer that must be true is C - I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
