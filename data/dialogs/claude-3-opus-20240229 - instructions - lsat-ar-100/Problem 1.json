Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

Franco does not testify the same day as Garcia.\nNow let's analyze each answer choice:\nA: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\nThis satisfies constraints 3 and 4. It doesn't violate any others. So this could be possible.\nB: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\nThis violates constraint 1, as Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. So this is not possible.\nC: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. \nThis satisfies constraint 2. It doesn't violate any others. So this could be possible.\nD: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nThis violates constraint 3, as Hong cannot testify on Monday. So this is not possible.\nE: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\nThis violates constraint 2, as exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday. So this is not possible.\nLooking at the analysis, B, D and E are not possible as they each violate a constraint.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
