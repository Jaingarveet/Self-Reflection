        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?\nChoices:\n  A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.\n  B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\n  C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the original constraint and understand its full implications.\n2. For each answer choice, determine if it is logically equivalent to the original constraint.\n3. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the original constraint.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that change the meaning of the original constraint.\n5. Select the answer choice that captures the full meaning and effect of the original constraint.\n"
