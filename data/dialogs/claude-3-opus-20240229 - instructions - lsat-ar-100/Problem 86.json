Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and note all given information and constraints.\n2. Start with any definitive information (e.g., bay 4 is produce).\n3. Apply each constraint one by one, noting what can be deduced at each step.\n4. If a placement can be narrowed down to [REDACTED] options, consider if the remaining information allows you to definitively place the remaining items.\n5. Continue this process until you've either placed all items or exhausted all given information.\n6. Count the number of definitively placed items and select the corresponding answer.\n"

So textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5. \n3. Livestock has a lower number than grain. And livestock has a higher number than textiles.\n   - If textiles are in bay 3, then livestock must be in bay 2. \n   - If textiles are in bay 5, then livestock could be in bay 2, 3 or 6.\n4. Produce has a higher number than fuel. So fuel must be in bay 1, 2 or 3. \n5. At this point, we have:\n   - Bay 1: Fuel, Livestock or Machinery \n   - Bay 2: Fuel, Livestock or Machinery\n   - Bay 3: Fuel, Textiles or Machinery  \n   - Bay 4: Produce\n   - Bay 5: Textiles or Grain\n   - Bay 6: Livestock or Grain\n6. The only item definitively placed is produce in bay 4. \nTherefore, only 1 out of the 6 bays has its cargo type completely determined.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
