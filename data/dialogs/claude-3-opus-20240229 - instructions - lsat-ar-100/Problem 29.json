At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Always start by placing the books with definite positions based on the given conditions.\n2. Place books on shelves based on their relative positions to other books.\n3. When a book's position is unclear, use the process of elimination based on the positions of other books.\n4. Ensure that all conditions are satisfied after placing all the books.\n5. Double-check your reasoning and the final arrangement to avoid faulty assumptions.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. From the conditions, we know:\n   - I is on the middle shelf\n   - F and M are on the same shelf\n   - K is on a higher shelf than F\n   - O is on a higher shelf than L\n   - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf\n2. L is on a higher shelf than H. Combined with the fact that O is higher than L, we can deduce:\n   Top shelf: O\n   Middle shelf: L, I\n   Bottom shelf: H\n   \n3. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, and F and M are on the same shelf:\n   - K must be on the top or middle shelf\n   - F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf\n   \n4. There are more books on the bottom than the top. With O on top and H on bottom, the other 6 books are split between middle and bottom. So the bottom must have at least 4 books total.\n5. This means F and M must be on the bottom with H. That puts K on the top with O.\n6. G is the only unplaced book. There are 3 on the bottom and 2 each on top and middle. So G must go in the middle with L and I.\nFinal arrangement:\nTop: O, K\nMiddle: L, I, G\nBottom: H, F, M\nTherefore, G and I are placed on the same shelf (middle).\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
