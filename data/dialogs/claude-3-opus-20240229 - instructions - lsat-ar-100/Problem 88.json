At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the given conditions and constraints.\n2. Consider each answer choice one at a time.\n3. For each choice, try to deduce the shelf placement for each book based on the given information and the new condition in the choice.\n4. If a choice leads to multiple possible arrangements, eliminate it and move to the next choice.\n5. If a choice uniquely determines the shelf placement for all books while satisfying all conditions, select it as the answer.\n6. Double-check the selected answer by confirming it is the only choice that fully determines the arrangement.\n"

Let's think through this step-by-step:\nGiven conditions:\n- Exactly 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) on 3 shelves \n- At least 2 books per shelf\n- More books on bottom shelf than top shelf\n- I on middle shelf \n- K on higher shelf than F\n- O on higher shelf than L\n- F on same shelf as M\nA: I and M on same shelf\nThis puts I, M, F on middle shelf. But bottom shelf must have more books than top, which is undetermined. Eliminate A.\nB: K and G on same shelf  \nK is above F, so K and G must be on top shelf. I is on middle. This leaves F, M, L, H, O for middle and bottom, but exact placement is undetermined. Eliminate B.\nC: L and F on same shelf\nF is with M, so L, F, M are together. They must be on bottom since I is middle and more books on bottom than top. This determines it:\nTop: K, O \nMiddle: I\nBottom: L, F, M, G, H\nC fully determines the arrangement.\nD: M and H on same shelf\nM is with F. Shelf for M, H, F is undetermined.
