Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and note all the conditions.\n2. Consider each condition one by one and think about its implications.\n3. For each answer choice, try to assign the unmentioned representatives to zones in a way that satisfies all the conditions.\n4. If you can find a valid assignment for an answer choice, it is a possible solution.\n5. If you can't find a valid assignment for an answer choice without violating a condition, eliminate it.\n6. Choose the answer that remains as a possible solution after considering all conditions and possibilities.\n"

There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA: Kim, Mahr \nThis leaves 5 reps for Zones 1 and 2. But conditions 3 and 4 require Parra, Quinn, Stuckey and Udall to be in the same zone, which is impossible. Eliminate A.\nB: Kim, Tiao\nIf Tiao is in Zone 3, then Parra must be in Zone 1 (condition 1), and Udall must be in Zone 2 (condition 2). This forces Quinn in Zone 1 and Stuckey in Zone 2 (conditions 3 and 4). But then Zone 2 has more reps than Zone 3, violating condition 5. Eliminate B.\nC: Parra, Quinn \nIf Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, then Tiao must be in Zone 1 (condition 1) and Udall in Zone 2 (condition 2). This leaves Stuckey for Zone 2 (condition 4), and Kim and Mahr can go in either Zone 1 or 3. This satisfies all conditions. Keep C.\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\nIf Tiao and Udall are in Zone 3, this violates condition 2. Eliminate D.\nE: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nIf these 4 are in Zone 3, then Tiao must be in Zone 1 (condition 1), leaving Kim and Mahr for Zone 2. But then Zone 3 doesn't have more reps than Zone 2, violating condition 5. Eliminate E.\nTherefore, the only possible complete and accurate list for Zone 3 is C: Parra, Quinn.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
