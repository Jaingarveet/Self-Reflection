The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nQuestion: The organizer must at least select\nChoices:\n  A: one French novel and one French play\n  B: one French novel and one Russian play\n  C: one Russian novel and one French play\n  D: two French novels\n  E: two Russian novels\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and understand what it is asking for.\n2. Identify the key constraints and requirements given in the problem.\n3. Analyze each requirement to determine what must be true in all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.\n4. Look for necessary conditions that must hold regardless of the specific works chosen.\n5. Avoid getting distracted by constructing specific scenarios that satisfy the constraints.\n6. Choose the answer choice that must be true in all valid scenarios.\n"

It's possible to select 3 Russian novels, 1 French novel, and 1 Russian play, satisfying all constraints without any French plays.\nB) Similar to A, the Russian play is not required. We could select 3 French novels and 2 Russian novels.\nC) The problem states at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. So it's not guaranteed that even one Russian novel will be chosen. The organizer could pick 3 French novels, 0 Russian novels, and 2 French plays.\nD) This looks promising. The constraints require at least as many French novels as Russian, and 3-4 novels total. So at minimum, 2 of the 3 novels must be French to satisfy both of those conditions in all cases.\nE) 2 Russian novels are not required, as explained in choice C. The Russian novels could be 0, 1 or 2 based on the constraints.\nTherefore, the only choice that must be true in all valid scenarios is D - two French novels.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
