Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and constraints.\n2. Identify the fixed constraints (e.g. George must present on Tuesday).\n3. Consider each answer choice one-by-one.\n4. For each choice, try to construct a scenario that satisfies all the constraints.\n5. If you can find a valid scenario, then that answer choice is possible.\n6. If you cannot find a valid scenario after thorough consideration, then that answer choice is impossible.\n7. Choose the answer that represents a possible scenario.\n"

But George must report on Tuesday, so there's no valid scenario.\nC: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n- George must report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot. No valid scenario.\nD: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n- This is possible and doesn't violate any constraints. \nScenario: Olivia (Mon AM), Robert (Mon PM), George (Tue AM), Nina (Wed AM)\nE: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n- Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so this would require him to report Wed AM. But if Nina reports before Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must take both slots on Wednesday. So there's no valid scenario with Robert reporting on Wednesday.\nIn summary, the only possible answer choices are A and D. Both represent scenarios that satisfy all the given constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
