The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand all the conditions and constraints given in the question.\n2. Identify the students who are definitively required to review the play in question based on the given conditions.\n3. Eliminate the students who are definitively prohibited from reviewing the play based on the given conditions.\n4. Analyze the remaining students and conditions to determine which additional students, if any, must review the play to satisfy all conditions.\n5. Select the answer choice that matches your determined list of students.\n"

The given conditions are:\n   - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. \n   - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n   - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. \n   - Exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other.\n2. From the conditions, we know definitively that Kramer and O'Neill must review Tamerlane.\n3. Lopez and Megregian are prohibited from reviewing any play Jiang reviews. However, it's not specified whether Jiang reviews Tamerlane or not. So we can't definitively eliminate Lopez or Megregian from reviewing Tamerlane based on this.\n4. The condition that exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other, combined with the fact that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, means that no other student can review Tamerlane. If a third student reviewed it, the \"exactly two students\" condition would be violated.\n5. Therefore, the complete list of students who review Tamerlane must be Kramer and O'Neill.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
