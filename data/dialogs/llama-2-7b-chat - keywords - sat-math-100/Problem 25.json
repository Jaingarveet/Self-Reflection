The first equation can be rewritten as $y = x^2$, and the second equation can be rewritten as $2y + 6 = 2(x + 3)$. Substituting the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation, we get $2x^2 + 6 = 2(x + 3)$. Simplifying, we get $2x^2 + 6 = 2x + 6$. Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $x^2 + 4 = 0$.\n\nReflection: I realized that I made a substitution error in the first equation, where I should have kept the $y$ on the left-hand side. This led to an incorrect solution. I will make sure to be more careful in my calculations and to follow the correct steps in the future.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
