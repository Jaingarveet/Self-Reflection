I realized my mistake and adjusted my approach accordingly.\n\nTo calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y, we need to divide the number of dreams recalled by Group Y by the total number of dreams recalled. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB: $\\frac{79}{100}$\n\nExplanation:\nThe table shows that Group Y recalled 79 dreams out of a total of 100 dreams recalled. Therefore, the probability of belonging to Group Y is $\\frac{79}{100}$."
