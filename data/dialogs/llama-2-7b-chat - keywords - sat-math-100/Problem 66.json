I misidentified the coordinates of the $x$-intercepts and applied the wrong formula to find the distance between them.\n\nReflection:\nI remembered that the function $f(x)=x^{2}+5x+4$ has two $x$-intercepts, which are $x=2$ and $x=-3$. However, I mistakenly labeled them as $x=1$ and $x=4$, respectively. This led me to apply the wrong formula to find the distance between the $x$-intercepts.\n\nTo find the distance between the $x$-intercepts, I should have used the formula:\n\ndistance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two $x$-intercepts.\n\nUsing this formula, I can calculate the distance between the $x$-intercepts as follows:\n\ndistance = √((2 - 1)² + (4 - 3)²) = √(5² + 1²) = √(7 + 1) = √8\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two $x$-intercepts is 8.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
