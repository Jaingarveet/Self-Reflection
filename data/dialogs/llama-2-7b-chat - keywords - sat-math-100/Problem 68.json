The correct equation to use is:\n\n$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)$$\n\nTo find the amount of the $10\\%$ by mass saline solution needed, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n\n$$0.10x = 0.18y - 0.20y$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$0.90x = 0.18y$$\n\nNow, if Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20\\%$ by mass saline solution, we can find the amount of the $10\\%$ by mass saline solution he needs by multiplying the amount of the $20\\%$ by mass saline solution by the ratio of the $10\\%$ by mass saline solution to the $20\\%$ by mass saline solution:\n\n$$x = \\frac{100}{0.20} = 500$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C): 500 milliliters of the $10\\%$ by mass saline solution.\n\nReflection:\nI realized that I made a mistake in my initial calculation by not properly simplifying the equation. I also realized that I should have used the correct equation to solve for $x$ in terms of $y$. Additionally, I noticed that I made a calculation error in my final answer, which resulted in the incorrect solution. I will make sure to be more careful and thorough in my calculations in the future."
