I misinterpreted the equation and calculated the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken.\n\nAction:\nTo find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we need to set the equation for beef equal to the equation for chicken:\n\n$$b = 2.35 + 0.25x$$\n$$c = 1.75 + 0.40x$$\n\nSubtracting the two equations, we get:\n\n$$b - c = 0.25x$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{b - c}{0.25}$$\n\nSubstituting the values given in the question, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{2.35 - 1.75}{0.25} = 0.40$$\n\nSo, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken is:\n\n$$b = 2.35 + 0.25 \\times 0.40 = 2.55$$\n\nAnswer: (C) $\\$ 2.55$\n\nError Keywords: Reflection, Misinterpretation, Calculation, Equations, Subtraction, Solving, Values, Price Per Pound."
