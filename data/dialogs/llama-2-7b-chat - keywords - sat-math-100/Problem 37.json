I see that I made a calculation error in my previous response.\n\nAction: Let's re-solve the problem using the correct formula and calculations.\n\nThe volume of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula:\nV = πr^2h\n\nWhere r is the radius of the cylinder, and h is its height.\n\nIn this case, the volume of cylinder A is 22 cubic centimeters.\n\nTo find the volume of the right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A, we can use the formula:\nV = π(2r)^2h/2\n\nWhere r is the new radius, which is twice the radius of cylinder A, and h is the new height, which is half the height of cylinder A.\n\nSo, the new radius is 2r = 4 cm, and the new height is h = 11 cm.\n\nNow, let's plug these values into the formula:\nV = π(2r)^2h/2\nV = π(4)^2(11)/2\nV = 55.5 cubic centimeters\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 55.5 cubic centimeters.\n\nError Keywords: Calculation error, Formula application error, Radius miscalculation.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to accurately answer the question this time."
