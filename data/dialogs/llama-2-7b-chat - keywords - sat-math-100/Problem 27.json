I will carefully review the problem and my solution to determine where I went wrong.\n\nReflection:\nThe problem states that $16 + 4x$ is 10 more than $14$. To find the value of $8x$, I need to isolate the variable $x$.\n\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the problem and set up the equation incorrectly. I mistakenly added $4x$ to both sides of the equation, which resulted in an incorrect solution.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I will set up the equation as follows:\n\n$16 + 4x = 14 + 4x$\n\nSubtracting $14$ from both sides gives us:\n\n$16 = 4x$\n\nDividing both sides by $4$ gives us:\n\n$4 = x$\n\nTherefore, the value of $8x$ is $32$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
