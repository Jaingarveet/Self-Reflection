This means that the total amount of solution he has is $n$ milliliters.\n\nIf he wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. This means that the total amount of solution he will have left over is $n - 21$ milliliters.\n\nI can set up an equation based on this information:\n\n$n = 4(x) + 21$\n\nWhere $x$ is the number of students in the class.\n\nSolving for $x$, I get:\n\n$x = \\frac{4n - 21}{3}$\n\nPlugging in the value of $n$ from the problem, I get:\n\n$x = \\frac{4(n) - 21}{3} = \\frac{4n - 21}{3}$\n\nSimplifying, I get:\n\n$x = \\frac{4n - 21}{3} = 23$\n\nTherefore, there are 23 students in Mr. Kohl's chemistry class.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED\n\nCorrect Answer: B"
