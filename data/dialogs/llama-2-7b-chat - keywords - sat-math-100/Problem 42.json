I realized that I made a mistake in my initial solution by not properly distributing the $x$ factor in the equation.\n2. I noticed that the equation can be simplified by factoring the left-hand side as $(a x + 2)(b x + 7) = (ab x^2 + (a + b) x + 14)$.\n3. I saw that the equation is true for all values of $x$, which means that $c$ must be a constant.\n4. I considered the values of $a+b=8$ and realized that there are only two possible values for $c$, which are $3$ and $5$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
