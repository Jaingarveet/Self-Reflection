I realized that the parabola intersects the line at two points, $A$ and $B$, and the length of $\\overline{A B}$ is the distance between these two points.\n\nTo calculate the length of $\\overline{A B}$, I used the formula for the distance between two points in the $x y$-plane: $d = \\sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)$.\n\nI plugged in the values for $x_1 = 11$, $y_1 = 25$, $x_2 = 11$, and $y_2 = 16$, and calculated the distance: $d = \\sqrt((11 - 11)^2 + (16 - 25)^2) = \\sqrt(0 + 95) = 95$.\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\overline{A B}$ is $95$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Parabola\n* Line\n* Points of intersection\n* Distance formula\n* $x y$-plane"
