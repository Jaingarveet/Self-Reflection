This means that for every $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ increase in temperature, the speed of sound increases by $0.6$ meters per second.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) The increase in the speed of sound, in meters per second, that corresponds to an increase of $1^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
