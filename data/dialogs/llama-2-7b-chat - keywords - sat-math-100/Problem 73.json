The sum of three numbers is 855, and one of the numbers is 50% more than the sum of the other two numbers. So, if we call the sum of the other two numbers x, then the value of the third number is 0.5x.\n\nNow, we can use the information given in the question to find the value of x. We know that the sum of the three numbers is 855, so x + 0.5x = 855. Simplifying the equation, we get 1.5x = 855. Dividing both sides by 1.5, we get x = 570.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
