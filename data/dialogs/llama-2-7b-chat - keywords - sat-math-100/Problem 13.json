I realized that I made a factoring error and misinterpreted the equation.\n\nAction: Let's try to solve the equation again. We have $\\sqrt{k+2} - x = 0$. We can factor the left-hand side as $\\sqrt{k} + \\sqrt{2} - x = 0$. Now, we can see that $\\sqrt{k} = 7$ or $\\sqrt{2} = 1.6$. So, the value of $k$ is either $7$ or $16$.\n\nAnswer: The value of $k$ is $16$.\n\nError Keywords: Factoring error, Misinterpretation"
