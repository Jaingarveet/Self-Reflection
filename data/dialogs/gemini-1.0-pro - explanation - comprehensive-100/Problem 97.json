I incorrectly assumed that the question was asking about the inheritance pattern of Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets, when in fact it was asking about the type of rickets. \nHere is my corrected thought process:\n* Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a type of rickets.\n* Rickets is a bone disease that is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D or calcium.\n* There are two main types of rickets: vitamin D-dependent rickets and vitamin D-resistant rickets.\n* Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a type of vitamin D-resistant rickets.\n* Vitamin D-resistant rickets is caused by a defect in the renal phosphate transport system.\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
