The editorial emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation, not the need for undemanding initial contact.\n* **B:** This choice directly aligns with the editorial's analogy of painting. A secure grasp of fundamentals is essential for progress, just as a properly prepared surface is essential for successful painting.\n* **C:** This choice is not directly related to the editorial's argument. While revising teaching methods is important, it is not the main point being made.\n* **D:** This choice is not supported by the editorial's argument. The editorial does not address the relative difficulty of teaching different levels of students.\n* **E:** This choice is too broad and does not specifically address the editorial's focus on the importance of a strong foundation.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on my analysis, the most logical completion of the editorial's argument is choice B: \"students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject.\"\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
