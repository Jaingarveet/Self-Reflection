The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). Setting this equal to 0 (since the line passes through the origin and thus has a slope of 0), we get 32-k = 0, which gives k = 32. However, this is not one of the options. Therefore, the line does not have a slope of 0, but rather, it passes through the origin, meaning the product of the coordinates of any point on the line should be zero. So, 2*k = 0 or k*32 = 0. This gives k = 0 as a possible value.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
