If G is placed on the top shelf, then K must also be placed on the top shelf because it must be on a higher shelf than F. Since F is on the same shelf as M, both F and M must be on the bottom shelf. O must be on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf. The remaining books, H and O, can be placed on any shelf. However, since the question asks for a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf, the answer must include I and L, and may include H, but not K, F, M, or O.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
