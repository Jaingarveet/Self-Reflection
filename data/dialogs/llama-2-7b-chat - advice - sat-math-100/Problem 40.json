I did not read the question carefully enough and misunderstood the problem. I will make sure to be more careful and attentive to the question in the future.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the question. If $20 - x = 15$, then we can set up the equation:\n\n$20 - x = 15$\n\nSubtracting $x$ from both sides gives us:\n\n$15 = x$\n\nSo, the value of $3x$ is $45$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
