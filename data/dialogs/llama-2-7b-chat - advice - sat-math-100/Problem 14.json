I misinterpreted the table provided and thought it was a different problem. I will make sure to read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the equation of a line to represent the relationship between $x$ and $y$. The equation of a line can be written in the form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nFrom the table provided, we can see that the slope of the line is $3a$, and the y-intercept is $a$. Therefore, the equation of the line that represents the relationship between $x$ and $y$ is:\n\n$y = 3x + a$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) $x + 2y = 5a$."
