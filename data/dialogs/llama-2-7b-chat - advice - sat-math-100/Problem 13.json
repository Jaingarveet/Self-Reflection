I did not factor the equation and attempted to simplify it directly, which led to an incorrect answer. To solve this equation, I will follow the correct steps and use algebraic methods to find the value of $k$.\n\nAction:\nLet's start by factoring the equation:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$\n\nWe can factor the left-hand side of the equation as:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2} = x$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $k$ by substituting the expression for $\\sqrt{k+2}$ into the equation:\n\n$$k+2 = x^2$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation by squaring both sides:\n\n$$k+2 = (x+1)^2$$\n\nNow, we can factor the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n$$(k+2) = (x+1)^2$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $k$ by subtracting $x+1$ from both sides:\n\n$$k = x+1$$\n\nSo, the value of $k$ is $7$.\n\nAnswer: $k = 7$\n\nI hope this reflection and solution help me answer the question correctly this time."
