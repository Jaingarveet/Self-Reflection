I misunderstood the equation and solved it incorrectly. After reevaluating the equation, I realized that the correct answer is (B) $v = \\frac{h-k+16}{t}$.\n\nExplanation: The equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$ can be rewritten as $h = v t + k$. Substituting this into the equation $v = \\frac{h-k+16}{t}$ gives us $v = \\frac{(v t + k) - k+16}{t} = \\frac{v t + k - k+16}{t} = v$. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) $v = \\frac{h-k+16}{t}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
