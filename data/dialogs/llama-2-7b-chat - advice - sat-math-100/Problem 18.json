Here's what happened:\n\nI read the question and saw that $9$ was the base, and the exponent was $\\frac{3}{4}$. I thought that the equivalent of $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ would be $\\sqrt[3]{9}$, but I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nTo find the equivalent of $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$, I should have decomposed the problem into smaller subproblems. First, I should have raised $9$ to the power of $\\frac{3}{4}$, which is equal to $3$. Then, I should have taken the square root of $3$, which is equal to $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C): $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.\n* Always decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the power of a number is the result of raising it to that power, not the result of adding it to itself."
