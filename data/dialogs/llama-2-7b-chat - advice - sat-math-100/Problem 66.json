I see that the function $f(x)=x^{2}+5x+4$ has two $x$-intercepts, which are $(0,4)$ and $(1,9)$. To find the distance between these two points, I will use the distance formula: $d = \\sqrt((x_{2} - x_{1})^{2} + (y_{2} - y_{1})^{2})$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe coordinates of the two $x$-intercepts are $(0,4)$ and $(1,9)$. Substituting these values into the distance formula, I get:\n\n$d = \\sqrt((1,9) - (0,4))^{2} + (y_{2} - y_{1})^{2} = \\sqrt(9^{2} + 5^{2}) = \\sqrt(81 + 25) = \\sqrt106$\n\nTherefore, the distance between the two $x$-intercepts is $\\sqrt106$. The correct answer is (B) $= \\sqrt106$."
