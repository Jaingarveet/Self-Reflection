I will make sure to read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.\n\nFor the function $g(x) = a x^2 + 24$, we can simplify it as follows:\n\n$$g(x) = a x^2 + 24 = a(x^2 + 24/a)$$\n\nNow, given that $g(4) = 8$, we can find the value of $g(-4)$ by multiplying $g(4)$ by the coefficient of the variable $x$:\n\n$$g(-4) = a(-4)^2 + 24 = -16 + 24 = 8$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) 8.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
