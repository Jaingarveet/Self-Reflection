I realized that the formula for weight is $W = mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet in $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to use the information provided in the table, which shows the acceleration due to gravity on each planet in meters per second squared. I can then use the formula to find the weight of the object on Mercury.\n\nThe mass of the object is 90 kilograms, which I will convert to meters per second squared by multiplying it by the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury, which is 3.6 meters per second squared.\n\nWeight = mass x acceleration due to gravity\nWeight = 90 kg x 3.6 m/s^2\nWeight = 324 N\n\nTherefore, the weight of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kilograms is 324 newtons.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
