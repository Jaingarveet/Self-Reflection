To find the estimated increase in height each year, I need to find the derivative of the model with respect to age.\n\n$$\\frac{d}{da} (3a + 28.6) = 3$$\n\nSo, the estimated increase in height each year is $3a$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is $5.7$, which is the estimated increase in height each year based on the model."
