I made a calculation error in my previous answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\nExplanation:\nTo find the value of $6r + 3$, we can use the given equation: $3r = 18$.\n\nFirst, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3 to get: $r = 6$.\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $6$ to get: $6r = 108$.\n\nFinally, we can add $3$ to both sides of the equation to get the correct answer: $6r + 3 = 111$.\n\nTherefore, the value of $6r + 3$ is $111$."
