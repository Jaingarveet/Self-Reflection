I realized that I simplified the expression incorrectly by not using the correct formula for the reciprocal of a fraction.\n\nAction: I will re-evaluate the expression using the correct formula for the reciprocal of a fraction.\n\nNew answer:\n\nThe equivalent of $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}}$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{x+2}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$$\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo simplify the expression, we need to find the reciprocal of the fraction inside the fraction. The formula for the reciprocal of a fraction is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{a+b} = \\frac{a}{a+b} \\cdot \\frac{b}{a+b}$$\n\nApplying this formula to the expression inside the fraction, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{x+2}{x^{2}+5 x+6} $$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $\\frac{x+2}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$."
