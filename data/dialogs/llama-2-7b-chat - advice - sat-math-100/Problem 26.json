I will follow the steps I should have taken to solve the problem correctly.\n\nStep 1: Write the two polynomials in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b, c$ are constants.\n\nFor the first polynomial, $3x^2 - 5x + 2 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 2$.\n\nFor the second polynomial, $5x^2 - 2x - 6 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 6$.\n\nStep 2: Combine like terms.\n\n$8x^2 - 7x - 4 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 2 - 7x + 4$.\n\n$8x^2 + 7x - 4 = 3(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 7x + 4$.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the expressions.\n\n$8x^2 - 7x - 4 = 3x^2 - 5x + 2$.\n\n$8x^2 + 7x - 4 = 3x^2 - 7x + 4$.\n\nThe sum of the two polynomials is $3x^2 - 7x + 6$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): $8 x^{2}-7 x-4$.\n\nI will make sure to follow these steps in the future and to double-check my calculations to ensure that I arrive at the correct answer."
