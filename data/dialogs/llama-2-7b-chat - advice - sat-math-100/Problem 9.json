I realized my mistake and reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.\n\nTo calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y, we need to find the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream, which is 68. Then, we can use the formula for probability to calculate the probability of belonging to Group Y:\n\nProbability of belonging to Group Y = Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream / Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream\n\nSubstituting the values given in the table, we get:\n\nProbability of belonging to Group Y = 68 / 100 = 0.68\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $\\frac{79}{100}$."
