I will use the given information to determine the factor of the polynomial.\n\nThe degree of the polynomial is 1, and the constant term is 3. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 2, and -2.\n\nTo find the factor of the polynomial, I will use the following steps:\n\n1. Factor out the constant term: $f(x) = 3x - 2$\n2. Factor out the highest degree term: $f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)$\n\nTherefore, the factor of the polynomial is $x - 2$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
