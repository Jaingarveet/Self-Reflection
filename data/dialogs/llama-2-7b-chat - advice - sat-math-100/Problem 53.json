I misunderstood the slope of the line and how it relates to the points on the line. To solve this problem correctly, I will follow the steps below:\n\nStep 1: Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\nThe line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\\frac{1}{7}$. We need to find the point that lies on the line.\n\nStep 2: Decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.\nThe slope of the line is $\\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every $1$ unit of horizontal movement, the line moves $7$ units vertically.\n\nStep 3: Think through each subproblem step-by-step.\nI will find the point that lies on the line by using the slope and the coordinates of the origin.\n\nStep 4: Double-check my calculations and final answer.\nI will make sure that my answer is correct by checking my calculations and the final answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
