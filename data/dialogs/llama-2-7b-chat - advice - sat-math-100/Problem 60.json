If Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution he has is $n$ milliliters. If he wants to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional $21$ milliliters.\n\nReflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer. The total amount of solution Mr. Kohl has is $n$ milliliters, and he needs an additional $21$ milliliters to give each student 4 milliliters. Therefore, the number of students in the class is $n + 21$.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is (B) $21$."
