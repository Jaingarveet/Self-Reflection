The correct solution is as follows:\n\nWhen $x = 6$, we have $y = kx = 24$.\n\nTo find the value of $y$ when $x = 5$, we can substitute $x = 5$ into the equation $y = kx$.\n\nSo, $y = k(5) = 10$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) $23$.\n\nI will make sure to double-check my calculations and assumptions in the future, and to carefully substitute values into the equation. Thank you for providing feedback on my previous answer."
