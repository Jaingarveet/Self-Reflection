To solve this problem correctly, I need to count the number of people in each gender and age group.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\nProbability = Number of people in the desired group / Total number of people in the contest\n\nIn this case, the desired group is either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older.\n\nNumber of people in the desired group = 8 (females under 40) + 3 (males age 40 or older) = 11\n\nTotal number of people in the contest = 25\n\nTherefore, the probability of the winner being either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older is:\n\nProbability = 11 / 25 = $\\frac{11}{25}$\n\nAnswer: (C) $\\frac{11}{25}$"
