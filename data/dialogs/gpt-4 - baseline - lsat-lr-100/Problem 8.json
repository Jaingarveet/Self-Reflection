For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.\nQuestion: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that\nChoices:\n  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably\n  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets\n  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets\n  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees\n  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer\n"
