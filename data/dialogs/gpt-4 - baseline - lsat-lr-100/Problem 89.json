The person then returns and tries to reconstruct the dream by asking only yes-or-no questions. In fact, no dream has been related: the group simply answers the questions according to some arbitrary rule. Surprisingly, the person usually constructs a dream narrative that is both coherent and ingenious.\nQuestion: The example presented above most closely conforms to which one of the following propositions?\nChoices:\n  A: The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence.\n  B: One is less apt to reach a false understanding of what someone says than to make no sense out of it at all.\n  C: Dreams are often just collections ofiruages and ideas without coherent structures.\n  D: Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative.\n  E: People often invent clever and coherent stories to explain their behavior to other people.\n"
