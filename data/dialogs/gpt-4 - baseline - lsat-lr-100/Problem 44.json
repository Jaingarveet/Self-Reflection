This is a flawed assumption because it ignores other factors that could influence the behavior.\nThe choice that most closely mirrors this flawed reasoning is D: \"It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.\" This argument makes the same flawed assumption: because a certain behavior (driving sedans) is common among a certain group of people (those who commute to work), it must also be common in a different group of people (people in Highland County) who share one characteristic with the first group (commuting to work).\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
