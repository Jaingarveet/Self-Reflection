Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nChoices:\n  A: 12/25\n  B: 3/2\n  C: 3\n  D: 2\n  E: 25/3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in setting up the proportion. I incorrectly assumed that 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] rolls, when in fact, 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] rolls. This led to an incorrect final answer.\nError Keywords:\n- Proportion error\n- Misinterpretation of problem\n- Incorrect assumption\nSolution:\nSix pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nLet x be the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.\n6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls\n[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes\n[REDACTED] baguettes = x pita breads\nCombining these proportions, we get:\n(6 pita breads) / ([REDACTED] rolls) = ([REDACTED] rolls) / (5 baguettes) = ([REDACTED] baguettes) / (x pita breads)\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n(6 pita breads) * (5 baguettes) * (x pita breads) = ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] baguettes)\nSimplifying, we get:\n[REDACTED]0x = 1[REDACTED]\nx = 1[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]0 = [REDACTED]/5\nTherefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED]/5 pita breads.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the relationships between the different items.\n[REDACTED]. Set up proportions based on the given information.\n[REDACTED]. Make sure the proportions are set up correctly, reflecting the actual relationships.\n4. Cross-multiply the proportions to eliminate common factors.\n5. Solve for the unknown variable by simplifying the resulting equation.\n6. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and the relationships between the items.\n- Make sure your proportions accurately reflect the given information.\n- Double-check your calculations and reasoning to avoid errors.\n- Consider using different approaches or representations to solve the problem, if needed.\n"
