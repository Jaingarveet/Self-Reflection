I will try my best to answer this question correctly.\n**Thought:**\nLet's analyze the given information:\n* Walking 20 steps takes 10 minutes, meaning the speed is 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.\n* Walking 10 steps takes 20 minutes, meaning the speed is 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.\n**Solution:**\nThe difference in speed between walking 20 steps and 10 steps is 2 steps/minute - 0.5 steps/minute = 1.5 steps/minute.\nSince the elevator is going down, the speed is negative. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is -1.5 steps/minute.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
