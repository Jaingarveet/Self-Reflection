What was the number of matches that the team lost?\nChoices:\n  A: 70\n  B: 30\n  C: 3\n  D: 7\n  E: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly calculated the number of matches lost by the tennis team. \nI knew the correct number of matches won and the percentage of matches lost, but I made a calculation error.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Percentage error\n - Division error\nSolution:\nThe team won 20 matches.\nThe team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.\nLet X be the total number of matches played.\nWe know that 0.[REDACTED]X = 20 (matches lost = [REDACTED]% of matches played = 20 matches won)\nDividing both sides by 0.[REDACTED], we get X = 66.66 (total matches played)\nTherefore, the team lost 66.66 - 20 = 46.66 matches.\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a match, we round up to 4[REDACTED] matches lost.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.\n2. Define a variable to represent the unknown quantity.\n[REDACTED]. Set up an equation that relates the given information to the unknown quantity.\n4. Solve the equation for the unknown quantity.\n[REDACTED]. Check your answer to make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n6. Be mindful of rounding errors and interpret the results accordingly.\nAdvice:\n- When dealing with percentages, remember to convert them into decimals before performing calculations.\n- Pay attention to units and make sure they are consistent throughout the problem.\n- Double-check your calculations and make sure your final answer is reasonable.\n- Consider using estimation to check your answer for reasonableness.\n- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n"
