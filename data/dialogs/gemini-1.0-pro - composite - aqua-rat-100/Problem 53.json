        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in solving the system of equations. I incorrectly solved for x and y, resulting in the wrong answer.\nError Keywords:\n - Algebraic error\n - System of equations error\n - Solution error\nSolution:\nLet's assume Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.\nFrom the first statement, we can write the equation: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)\nFrom the second statement, we can write the equation: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)\nSimplifying the equations:\ny + 30 = 2x - 60\nx + 10 = 3y - 30\nSolving for x and y:\nx = 2y - 40\ny = (x + 40)/3\nSubstituting the value of y in the first equation:\nx = 2((x + 40)/3) - 40\n3x = 2x + 80 - 120\nx = 62\nSubstituting the value of x in the second equation:\ny = (62 + 40)/3\ny = 34\nInstructions:\n1. Assign variables to represent the unknowns.\n2. Write equations based on the given information.\n3. Simplify the equations to make them easier to solve.\n4. Solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination.\n5. Check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated values.\nAdvice:\n - Be careful when manipulating equations, especially when substituting variables.\n - Double-check your calculations and solutions to avoid errors.\n - Consider using different methods to solve the system of equations to verify your answer.\n - If you get stuck, try breaking down the problem into smaller steps or seeking help from others.\n"
