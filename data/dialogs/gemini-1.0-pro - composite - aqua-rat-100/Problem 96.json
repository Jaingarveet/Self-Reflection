I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I incorrectly calculated the ratio of investments.\n* **Solution:** I should have calculated the ratio of investments as (40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * x), where x is the number of months C invested.\n* **Instructions:** I should carefully read the question and understand the investment details of each partner.\n* **Advice:** I should double-check my calculations and ensure that I am using the correct formula.\n**Answer:**\nLet x be the number of months C invested.\nThe ratio of investments of A, B, and C is:\n(40,000 * 12) : (60,000 * 10) : (120,000 * x) = 4:3:2x\nSince C's share is Rs.150,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit, we have:\n(2/5) * 375,000 = (2x / (4 + 3 + 2x)) * 375,000\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 8\nTherefore, C joined the business 8 months after B joined.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")**"
