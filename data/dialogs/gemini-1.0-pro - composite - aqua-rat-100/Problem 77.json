Identify the set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.\n2. Calculate the sum of these numbers.\n3. Divide the sum by 10.\n4. Check if the result is a perfect square.\n5. If the result is a perfect square, the corresponding starting number is the correct answer.\n6. If the result is not a perfect square, repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining options.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the instructions carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that a perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer.\n - Remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n/2)*(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n"
