I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* \"Two semi circles are drawn on its opposites as diameters.\"\n* \"If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\"\n**Solution:**\n1. Calculate the area of the square paper: 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2.\n2. Calculate the area of one semi-circle: (π * 20^2) / 4 = 100π cm^2.\n3. Calculate the area of two semi-circles: 2 * 100π cm^2 = 200π cm^2.\n4. Subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper: 400 cm^2 - 200π cm^2 ≈ 8.75 cm^2.\n**Instructions:**\n* Carefully read the question and identify the key information.\n* Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.\n* Use the appropriate formulas to calculate the areas.\n* Pay attention to units and round the final answer to the nearest hundredth.\n**Advice:**\n* Take your time and double-check your calculations.\n* Make sure you understand the concepts involved in the problem.\n* If you are unsure, ask for help or clarification.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")"
