I will try my best to answer this question correctly.\n**Thought:**\n* The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled is proportional to the time elapsed.\n* The angle of elevation is changing, which means the car is getting closer to the tower.\n* We can use trigonometry to relate the angle of elevation, the distance traveled, and the height of the tower.\n**Solution:**\nLet:\n* $h$ be the height of the tower.\n* $d$ be the distance traveled by the car.\n* $t$ be the time elapsed.\nFrom the given information, we have:\n* $\\tan 45^\\circ = \\frac{h}{d_1}$\n* $\\tan 60^\\circ = \\frac{h}{d_2}$\nwhere $d_1$ is the distance traveled in the first 10 minutes and $d_2$ is the distance traveled in the next $t$ minutes.\nSince the car is moving at a uniform speed, we have:\n* $\\frac{d_1}{10} = \\frac{d_2}{t}$\nSolving for $d_2$, we get:\n* $d_2 = \\frac{10t}{d_1}$\nSubstituting $d_1$ and $d_2$ into the equations above, we get:\n* $1 = \\frac{h}{d_1}$\n* $\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{h}{\\frac{10t}{d_1}}$\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n* $t = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}$\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after an additional $\\boxed{\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}}$ minutes.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
