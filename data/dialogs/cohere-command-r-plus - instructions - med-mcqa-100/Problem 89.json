        "content": "Reflection: Spondylolisthesis is a spinal condition where one vertebra slips forward onto the bone below it. Standard investigations typically include:\n- Anteroposterior (AP) X-rays to view the spine front-to-back and detect slippage.\n- Lateral X-rays for a side view of the spinal column and nerve roots.\n- CT scans provide detailed bone images and are useful for pre-surgical planning or when bone injury is suspected.\n- MRI scans offer soft tissue detail and are indicated when neurological issues are suspected or to evaluate spinal cord compression.\n\nAP X-rays are essential for initial diagnosis, while CT and MRI have specific indications and aren't universally used in all cases. Thus, these advanced scans aren't routinely necessary and can be considered not useful in some instances of spondylolisthesis.\n\nLesson: To answer such questions, consider the fundamental, universally accepted diagnostic tools and the specific indications for advanced investigations."
