Understand the question: Identify what type of RBCs are being referred to as \"senescent.\"\n2. Recognize the association: Know that certain *Plasmodium* species have a preference for specific RB[REDACTED] types. \n3. Specificity: Recall that *P. falciparum* primarily infects young RBCs, while *P. malariae*, causing quartan malaria, targets senescent RBCs due to its long persistence in the body. \n4. Answer selection: Choose \"[REDACTED]\" as the correct answer, as quartan malaria is associated with *P. malariae*, which has an affinity for senescent RBCs.\n"
