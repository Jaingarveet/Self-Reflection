This is distinct from the typical infarction, which usually refers to the death of tissue due to a lack of blood supply. \n\nPulmonary infarction is a result of a blockage in the pulmonary circulation, often arising from a pulmonary embolism, which is the main factor that differentiates it from other organ infarctions. \n\nWhile the provided answer options cover various organs, only one specifically relates to the pathologic process described. This critical thinking process will help ensure a correct answer.\n\nNow, answer the question again with this new knowledge and understanding."
