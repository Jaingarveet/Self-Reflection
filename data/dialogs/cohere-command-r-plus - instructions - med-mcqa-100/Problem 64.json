        "content": "Reflection: Ovarian tumors can undergo torsion during pregnancy due to the increased risk factors of a enlarged uterus, elevated hormone levels, and changing ligamentous support. During pregnancy, the ovarian tumors that are most prone to torsion are those that show rapid growth and have a pedunculated structure. This makes them unstable and more mobile within the abdominal cavity. While all the listed tumor types can undergo torsion in non-pregnant individuals, the correct answer should reflect the unique context of pregnancy.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is **'C: Dermoid cyst.'**\n\nExplanation: \n- Serous cystadenomas and mucinous cystadenomas are not typically associated with rapid growth, especially during pregnancy, and are therefore less likely to undergo torsion.\n- Dermoid cysts, on the other hand, have a tendency to grow rapidly and often have a pedunculated structure, making them unstable and more prone to torsion during pregnancy.\n- Theca lutein cysts are commonly associated with pregnancy, but they typically do not show the same rapid growth rate as dermoid cysts and are usually not pedunculated, reducing their risk of torsion."
