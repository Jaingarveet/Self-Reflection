In the Bishop score, a length of <3 cm is assigned 2 points, not 3 cm precisely, which would indicate an intermediate score of 1. Therefore, the correct calculation for the given information is:\n- Dilation: 3 cm (3 points)\n- Cervical softness: slightly soft (1 point)\n- Cervical position: anterior (1 point)\n- Cervical length: < 0.5 cm (2 points)\n- Station: -1 (1 point)\n\nTotal: 7, choice A."
