The salt split skin technique is used to examine the dermal-epidermal junction. I need to identify which antigen, out of the choices given, is located on the epidermal side of this junction and bound by IgG antibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid.\n\nThought: In Cicatricial pemphigoid, an autoimmune disease, IgG autoantibodies target antigens on the epidermal side of the dermal-epidermal junction, which can be visualized using the salt split skin technique. One of the primary antigens targeted in this disease is collagen XVII, a transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome. Therefore, the correct answer is \"A: XVII collagen.\"\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
