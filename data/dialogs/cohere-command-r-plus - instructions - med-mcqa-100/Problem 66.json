This means the total shedding time is around two weeks before symptoms and one week thereafter, making answer choice C the correct answer. My previous answer was incorrect because I may have confused the shedding duration of Hepatitis A with that of another pathogen, or I may not have considered the full duration including the pre-symptomatic phase. To avoid making the same mistake again, I will review the unique characteristics of common pathogens, especially those with similar names, and pay closer attention to the specific details provided in the question.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
