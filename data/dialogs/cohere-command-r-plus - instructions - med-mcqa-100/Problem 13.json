Understand the clinical context: Pyloric stenosis involves the narrowing of the pylorus, causing potential obstruction and vomiting. \n2. Recognize the role of imaging: Abdominal imaging is crucial for diagnosing pyloric stenosis and evaluating the upper gastrointestinal tract. \n3. Consider ultrasound's advantages: Ultrasound is a non-invasive, safe, and effective imaging modality that can provide detailed images of the pylorus and surrounding structures. \n4. Recall characteristic ultrasound findings: Pyloric stenosis often presents with specific ultrasound features, including pyloric muscle hypertrophy and a distended stomach. \n5. Choose the most appropriate imaging modality: Abdominal ultrasound ([REDA[REDACTED]ED]) is the initial investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis due to its sensitivity, safety profile, and ability to detect characteristic findings.\n"
