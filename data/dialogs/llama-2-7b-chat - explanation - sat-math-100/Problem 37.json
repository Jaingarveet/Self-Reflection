What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was:\n\nV = πr^2h\n\nWhere r is the radius of the cylinder A, and h is the height of the cylinder A.\n\nHowever, I made an error in my calculation. I multiplied the radius of cylinder A by 2, which gave me a radius of 4 for the new cylinder. But, I should have multiplied the radius by 4 to get the correct radius of 8.\n\nSo, the correct calculation for the volume of the new cylinder is:\n\nV = π(8)^2h = 64πh\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 22 cubic centimeters.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
