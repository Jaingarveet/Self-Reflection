However, the correct answer is (B).\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen you simplified the expression for $4z + 8y$, you wrote:\n\n$4z + 8y = (a + 2b)^2$\n\nBut, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is (B): $(2a + 2b)^2$.\n\nHere's how you can see this:\n\nFrom the first equation, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = z$.\n\nFrom the second equation, we know that $ab = y$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $4z + 8y$, we get:\n\n$4z + 8y = (2a + 2b)^2$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B): $(2a + 2b)^2$.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"
