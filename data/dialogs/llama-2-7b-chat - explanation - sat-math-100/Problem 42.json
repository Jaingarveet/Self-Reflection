We want to find the possible values of $c$.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by subtracting $15x^2$ from both sides:\n\n$$cx + 14 = (a x + 2)(b x + 7) - 15x^2$$\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by $a x + 2$:\n\n$$ac = (b x + 7)(a x + 2) - 15x^2$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation further by multiplying both sides by $b x + 7$:\n\n$$ac = (b x + 7)^2 - 15x^2$$\n\nSince the left-hand side is a perfect square, we know that $c$ must be an integer. Therefore, the possible values for $c$ are:\n\n$$c = 0, 1, 15, 35, 41$$\n\nSo, the two possible values for $c$ are $31$ and $41$. Therefore, the answer is (D): $c = 31$ or $c = 41$.\n"

To arrive at this answer, I simplified the equation by subtracting $15x^2$ from both sides, multiplied both sides by $a x + 2$, and then simplified further by multiplying both sides by $b x + 7$. I realized that the left-hand side of the equation is a perfect square, which means that $c$ must be an integer. Therefore, the possible values for $c$ are $0, 1, 15, 35, 41$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
