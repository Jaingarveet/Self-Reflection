I correctly set up the equation $y = kx$ and substituted $x = [REDACTED]$ to get $y = 12$. However, I then made an error in my calculation by assuming that the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ would be the same as when $x = [REDACTED]$.\n\nThe correct solution is:\n\nIf $y = kx$ and $y = 24$ when $x = [REDACTED]$, then we can set up the equation:\n\n$$y = kx$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 5$, we get:\n\n$$y = k(5)$$\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n$$y = 10$$\n\nSo, the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ is $10$.\n"
