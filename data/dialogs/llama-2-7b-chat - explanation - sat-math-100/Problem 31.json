Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\quad 0.002$\n  B: $\\quad 200$\n  C: $\\quad 2,000$\n  D: 20,000\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly answered the question by choosing option [REDACTED], which represents the correct answer of [REDACTED] 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.\n\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\n\n1. We know that 1 decagram = 10 grams, so 2 decagrams = 20 grams.\n2. We also know that 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram, so 2,000 milligrams = 2 grams.\n3. Therefore, 2 decagrams of medicine = 20 grams = 0.002 kilograms.\n4. Since 1 kilogram = 1,000,000 milligrams, we can convert 0.002 kilograms to milligrams by dividing by 1,000,000: 0.002 kg = 2,000,000 mg.\n5. Finally, since 1 milligram = 1/1,000 gram, we can convert 2,000,000 milligrams to 1-milligram doses by dividing by 1,000: 2,000,000 mg = 2,000,000 / 1,000 = 2,000 1-milligram doses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.\n"

You correctly identified the mistake in your previous answer and explained the correct solution step-by-step.\n\nTo answer the question, you can choose option [REDACTED]: 2,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.\n\nHere's a summary of your steps:\n\n1. You recognized that 1 decagram = 10 grams, so 2 decagrams = 20 grams.\n2. You converted 2,000 milligrams to grams by dividing by 1,000: 2,000 mg = 2,000 / 1,000 = 2 grams.\n3. You calculated the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container by dividing the total weight of medicine in the container by the weight of one 1-milligram dose: 2,000,000 mg = 2,000,000 / 1,000 = 2,000 1-milligram doses.\n\nGreat job!"
