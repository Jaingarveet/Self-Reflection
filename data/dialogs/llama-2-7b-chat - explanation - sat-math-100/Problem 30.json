The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.\n  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.\n  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

When the price of the product increases by $10$, the quantity supplied will also increase by $10$ units, as shown in the supply function. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by selecting (A) The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units. I understand now that the supply function increases as the price of the product increases, so the quantity supplied will increase when the price rises."
