Well done!\n\nTo break it down, you correctly simplified the equation by combining like terms, which gave you a quadratic equation:\n\n$$\\frac{24 x^2 + 25 x - 47}{a} = -8x - [REDACTED] - \\frac{5[REDACTED]}{a}$$\n\nYou then identified the solutions to the quadratic equation, which are $x = [REDACTED]$ and $x = 2$. Since the equation is true for all values of $x$ except when $x = \\frac{2}{a}$, we can conclude that $a$ must be a non-zero integer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $a = [REDACTED]$.\n\nWell done!\n\nHere are some general tips to help you with similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Break down the equation into simpler terms and identify the variables and constants involved.\n[REDACTED]. Use algebraic manipulation to simplify the equation and identify the solutions.\n4. Check your solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.\n5. Double-check your work by verifying that the equation is true for all values of the variable except when it is equal to the specified value.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect! Keep practicing and you will become more confident and proficient in solving math problems.\n"
