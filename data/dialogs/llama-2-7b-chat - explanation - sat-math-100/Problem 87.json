The parabola intersects the line at two points, $A$ and $B$, and the length of $\\overline{A B}$ is the distance between these two points.\n\nAction:\nI will use the correct equation of the parabola and the line to find the length of $\\overline{A B}$.\n\n$$y = (x-11)^2$$\n$$y = 25$$\n\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{y + 11}{2}$$\n\nSubstituting $y = 25$, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{25 + 11}{2} = 14$$\n\nNow, we need to find the distance between $A$ and $B$.

Therefore, the correct answer is $B$."
