I identified the $x$-intercepts as $x = -3$ and $x = 2$, but I applied the wrong formula to find the distance between them.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nTo find the distance between the $x$-intercepts, we need to use the formula:\n\ndistance = √(x2 - x1)^2\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\ndistance = √((-3) - 2)^2\n= √(5)^2\n= 5\n\nTherefore, the distance between the $x$-intercepts is 5."
