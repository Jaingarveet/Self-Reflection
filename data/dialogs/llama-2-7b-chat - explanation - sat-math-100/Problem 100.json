The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\right)$.\nQuestion: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?\nChoices:\n  A: $-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  B: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  C: $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  D: $-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nYou are correct that the speed of a sound wave is directly proportional to the inverse of the air temperature, as given by the formula $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$. To find the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to set this expression equal to 1,000 and solve for $t$.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in your solution. You correctly solved for $t$ to be $-47.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$, but you then incorrectly answered that the correct answer is (C).\n\nThe correct answer is (B): [REDACTED].\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen we set $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$ equal to 1,000, we get:\n\n$1,052 + 1.08t = 1,000$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t = -48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n\nTherefore, the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second is [REDACTED].\n\nGreat job on recognizing the direct proportional relationship between the speed of a sound wave and the inverse of the air temperature!\n"
