Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{68}{100}$\n  B: $\\frac{79}{100}$\n  C: $\\frac{79}{164}$\n  D: $\\frac{164}{200}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nThe problem asks us to find the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y. To do this, we need to use the total number of dreams recalled by each group.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Group X recalled 36 dreams, and Group Y recalled 125 dreams. So, the total number of dreams recalled is 161 (36 + 125).\n\nNow, let's find the number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone:\n\nGroup Y recalled 68 dreams.\n\nSo, the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:\n\n$$\\frac{68}{161}$$\n\nThis is the correct answer, so we should choose option (B) on the multiple-choice question.\n"

To find the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y, I should have used the total number of dreams recalled by each group, which is 161 (36 + 125).\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Group X recalled 36 dreams, and Group Y recalled 125 dreams. Therefore, the total number of dreams recalled is 161.\n\nTo find the number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone, we can subtract the number of dreams recalled by Group X from the total number of dreams recalled:\n\n125 - 36 = 89\n\nSo, the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:\n\n$$\\frac{89}{161}$$\n\nThis is the correct answer, so we should choose option (B) on the multiple-choice question."
