Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists could accurately identify the cargo held in each of the loading dock's first three bays, listed in order from bay 1 to bay 3?\nChoices:\n  A: fuel, machinery, textiles\n  B: grain, machinery, fuel\n  C: machinery, livestock, fuel\n  D: machinery, textiles, fuel\n  E: machinery, textiles, produce\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly analyzed the given information and made an error in my reasoning. \nI focused on the relative positions of the cargo types but overlooked the absolute positions within the bays numbered 1 through 6.\n"
