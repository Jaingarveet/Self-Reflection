This was a flawed assumption because I did not consider the possibility of Franco and Garcia testifying on different days.\n**Correct Answer:** E\n**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**\n1. **Iturbe on Wednesday:** This leaves two remaining slots for Monday and Tuesday.\n2. **Jackson on Wednesday:** This leaves one remaining slot for Monday and Tuesday.\n3. **Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day:** This means they must be split between Monday and Tuesday.\n4. **At least one witness on Monday:** This eliminates the possibility of both Franco and Garcia being on Tuesday.\n5. **Exactly two witnesses on Tuesday:** This leaves only one remaining slot for Monday.\nTherefore, the only possible scenario is:\n* **Monday:** Franco\n* **Tuesday:** Garcia and Hong\n* **Wednesday:** Iturbe and Jackson\nThis confirms that Garcia and Hong must testify on the same day.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\") \n"
