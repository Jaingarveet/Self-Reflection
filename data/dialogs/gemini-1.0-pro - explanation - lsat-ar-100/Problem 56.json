However, this reasoning was flawed because it did not consider the possibility that Tiao could also work in Zone 1.\n**Correct Answer:** D\n**Reasoning:** \n* We know that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.\n* We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n* If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. However, this would contradict the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n* Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Parra must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3.\n* Since there are already two sales representatives in Zone 2 (Parra and Quinn), Parra cannot work in Zone 2.\n* Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 3.\n**Conclusion:** The only option that satisfies all the conditions is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n## Action:\nAnswer(\"D\")"
