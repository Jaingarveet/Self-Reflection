Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the bay holding livestock?\nChoices:\n  A: bay 1\n  B: bay 2\n  C: bay 3\n  D: bay 5\n  E: bay 6\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy initial analysis was correct in identifying the relative positions of the different cargo types based on the given information. However, I made a mistake in interpreting the constraint about the proximity of Textiles and Produce. I assumed that they had to be directly adjacent, which is not explicitly stated in the problem.\n"
