The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

However, this assumption was not supported by the given information.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Reasoning:**\n* We know that exactly three students review Undulation.\n* We also know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n* Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, it follows that Megregian must review Undulation.\n* Therefore, the remaining two students who review Undulation must be either Jiang and Lopez, or Jiang and O'Neill.\n* However, we know that exactly two students review the same play(s) as each other. This means that Jiang cannot review Undulation, as this would violate the condition.\n* Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
