Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

Specifically, I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n**Corrected Approach:**\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all the rules and constraints and then systematically eliminate the answer choices that violate any of them.\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n1. **Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.** This means that Souza cannot be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6.\n2. **Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.** This means that Young cannot be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, or #3.\n3. **Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.** This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n**Eliminating Answer Choices:**\n* **A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.** This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n* **B: Young is assigned parking space #2.** This violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n* **C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.** This violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n* **D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.** This violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n* **E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.** This does not violate any of the rules.\n**Therefore, the only possible scenario is that Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.**\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")**"
