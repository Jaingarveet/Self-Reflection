There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?\nChoices:\n  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$\n  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$\n  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$\n  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$\n\nThought:\nThe function is linear, so it has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nWe can use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept.\nAction: \nThe slope is the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight, which is $\\frac{\\$ 21.89-\\$ 16.94}{10-5}=\\$ 0.99$.\nThe y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is $\\$ 16.94$.\nTherefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+16.94$.\nAnswer: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI correctly identified that the function is linear and used the slope-intercept form, but I made an error in calculating the y-intercept. \nThe y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is not given in the table. \nTherefore, I should have used the given data to find the slope and then used the slope and any point in the table to find the y-intercept. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Slope-intercept form error\n - Y-intercept error\nSolution:\nThe slope is the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight, which is $\\frac{\\$ 21.89-\\$ 16.94}{10-5}=\\$ 0.99$.\nUsing the point $(5, \\$ 16.94)$, we can find the y-intercept as follows:\n$16.94=0.99(5)+b$\n$b=11.99$\nTherefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.\nInstructions:\n1.
