There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)\nChoices:\n  A: 0.410\n  B: 0.357\n  C: 0.333\n  D: 0.250\n\nThought:\nLet's start by finding the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students. Then, we can use the given ratios to find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students. Finally, we can use the total number of right-handed students and the number of right-handed female students to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.\nLet's denote the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students as $f$ and $m$, respectively. Then, we have:\n$f + m = 18$ (total number of left-handed students)\n$9m = 122 - f$ (number of right-handed male students)\n$5f = 122 - 9m$ (number of right-handed female students)\nSolving for $f$ and $m$, we get:\n$f = \\frac{122}{14}, m = \\frac{40}{7}$\nNow, we can find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students:\n$5f = \\frac{610}{14}$\n$9m = \\frac{360}{7}$\nThe total number of right-handed students is:\n$\\frac{610}{14} + \\frac{360}{7} = \\frac{1220}{7}$\nTherefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:\n$\\frac{\\frac{610}{14}}{\\frac{1220}{7}} = \\frac{35}{98} \\approx 0.357$\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
