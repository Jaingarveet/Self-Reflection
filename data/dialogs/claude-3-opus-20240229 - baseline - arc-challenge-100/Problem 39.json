This process of recycling stellar material is associated with star formation.\nC: Iron fusion occurs in the cores of very massive stars late in their lives, leading to supernovae. This is not directly related to the formation of new stars.\nD: Protostars gain mass during star formation, but they don't typically become twice as massive as the Sun before they become main sequence stars. The mass of a newly formed star can vary widely.\nConsidering the choices, B is the best answer. The accumulation of material from dead stars, which disperses elements into interstellar space, contributes to the formation of new star-forming regions.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
