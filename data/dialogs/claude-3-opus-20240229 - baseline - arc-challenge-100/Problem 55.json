In the gas state (steam), water molecules have high kinetic energy. They move rapidly and are spaced far apart.\n2. As steam cools and condenses into liquid water, the molecules lose kinetic energy. This means they move more slowly.\n3. When the molecules move more slowly, the attractive forces between them become stronger relative to their motion. This causes the molecules to move closer together.\n4. So in the liquid state, the water molecules are closer together, occupying less space than in the gas state.\nTherefore, as water changes from steam to liquid, the molecules move slower and occupy less space.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
