Frost forms when moist air comes in contact with a cold surface.\n2. The cold surface cools the air near it, causing the water vapor in the air to change state.\n3. The water vapor changes directly from a gas to a solid state, skipping the liquid state.\n4. This process is called deposition or sublimation.\n5. Sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gas state, without passing through the liquid state. In this case, it's the reverse process, from gas to solid.\nTherefore, the water vapor has sublimated to cause frost.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
