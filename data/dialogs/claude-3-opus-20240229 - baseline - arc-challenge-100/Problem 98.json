When a substance is heated (i.e., warming), its particles gain kinetic energy and move faster. \n3. When a substance is cooled, its particles lose kinetic energy and slow down.\n4. When a liquid turns into a solid, its particles lose kinetic energy as they slow down and arrange into a fixed pattern.\n5. When a gas turns into a liquid, its particles lose kinetic energy as they slow down and come closer together.\nSince the question states that the kinetic energies of the particles are increasing, the sample must be warming, not cooling. \nBoth liquids and gases can be warmed, but the question specifies that the kinetic energies of particles are increasing, which is more characteristic of a liquid being warmed than a gas being warmed.\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
