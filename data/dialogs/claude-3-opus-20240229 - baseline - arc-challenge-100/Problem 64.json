Sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce energy for growth. Less sunlight would result in slower growth rates.\nC: amount of soil\nWhile soil quality and quantity can affect plant growth, the question does not mention any difference in soil between the two yards.\nD: amount of rain\nThe amount of rain would likely be similar in both yards, as they are in the same area. The question does not mention any difference in water availability.\nBased on the information provided, the amount of light is the most likely factor contributing to the difference in grass growth rates between the treeless and tree-shaded yards.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
