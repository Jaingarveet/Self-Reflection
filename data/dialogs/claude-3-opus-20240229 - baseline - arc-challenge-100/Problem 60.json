It doesn't quite fit the wise use and avoiding waste described in the question.\nB. Recycling: While important, recycling is about reusing materials, not directly about using fossil fuels wisely.\nC. Substitution: Substitution would involve replacing fossil fuels with another energy source. The question is more about using fossil fuels themselves wisely.\nD. Conservation: Conservation is about using resources wisely and efficiently, avoiding waste. This aligns with the question's description of using fossil fuels wisely and avoiding waste.\nTherefore, the best answer is conservation.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
