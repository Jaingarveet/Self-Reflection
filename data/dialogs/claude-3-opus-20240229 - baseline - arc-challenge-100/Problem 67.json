However, they typically don't form canyons.\nB. Rivers: Running water in rivers erodes the landscape over long periods, forming both valleys and canyons. The Grand Canyon, for example, was carved by the Colorado River.\nC. Wind: Wind can erode landforms, but it is not the primary force responsible for forming valleys and canyons.\nD. Tides: Tides can cause erosion along coastlines but do not typically create valleys or canyons.\nAmong the given choices, rivers are the most likely to form both valleys and canyons through the process of long-term erosion.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
