Polluting is the introduction of contaminants into the environment, which does not construct new land.\n3. Deposition is the process where eroded material is deposited or laid down in a new location. This can lead to the construction of new landforms over time, such as river deltas or beaches.\n4. Weathering is the breaking down of rocks, soils, and minerals through contact with the Earth's atmosphere, water, and biological organisms. While weathering is an important part of the rock cycle, it does not directly construct new land.\nTherefore, the process most directly related to constructing new land is deposition.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
