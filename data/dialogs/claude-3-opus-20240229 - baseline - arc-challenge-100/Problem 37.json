Migrating: Many animals, such as birds and whales, migrate seasonally. This behavior is instinctive and not learned.\nB. Hibernating: Some animals, like bears, hibernate during winter to conserve energy when food is scarce. This is an innate behavior.\nC. Hunting skills: While some aspects of hunting may be instinctive, hunting skills are often learned and improved through practice and observation of other members of the species.\nD. Building nests: Many birds and some other animals build nests instinctively. This behavior is not learned but rather an innate ability.\nAmong the given choices, hunting skills stand out as an example that is not entirely instinctive, as it involves learning and practice.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
