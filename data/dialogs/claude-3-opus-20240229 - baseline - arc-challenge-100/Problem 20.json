        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. High tides occur roughly twice a day due to the gravitational pull of the moon. So high tides are much more frequent than every three months.\n2. New moons occur once in each lunar cycle, which is about 29.5 days. So new moons happen more often than every three months. \n3. The Earth's orbit around the sun, combined with the tilt of the Earth's rotational axis, results in seasons. As the Earth orbits the sun, the amount of sunlight each hemisphere receives changes, leading to seasonal changes. This cycle takes about a year, with a new season beginning approximately every three months in most parts of the world.\n4. Solar eclipses occur when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, and the moon fully or partially blocks the Sun. Total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because the shadow cast by the Moon is relatively small. Solar eclipses do not occur on a regular three-month schedule.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that a new season occurs about every three months.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
