In the given food chain: Sunlight -> Grass -> Rabbit -> Snake\n   - Sunlight is a non-living (abiotic) factor. It is the primary energy source for the food chain.\n   - Grass, Rabbit, and Snake are all living (biotic) components of the food chain.\n4. Therefore, the abiotic factor in this food chain is Sunlight.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
