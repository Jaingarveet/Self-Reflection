If the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it means the hypothesis was not supported by the data. This is a normal and important part of the scientific process.\n3. When this happens, the scientist should not change the hypothesis to match the results, as that would be dishonest and goes against the principles of scientific inquiry.\n4. Similarly, choosing a different investigation altogether would be avoiding the issue rather than addressing it.\n5. The best course of action is to repeat the investigation. This allows the scientist to check if the original results were accurate or if there were any errors or anomalies.\n6. If repeated investigations continue to produce results that do not match the hypothesis, then the scientist should consider modifying or rejecting the original hypothesis.\nTherefore, the best answer is to repeat the investigation.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
