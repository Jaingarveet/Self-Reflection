The geese traveled at a constant rate, which means they covered the same distance each day.\nTo find the distance traveled on the first day, we need to calculate the daily distance:\nDaily distance = Total distance รท Number of days\nDaily distance = 2,000 km รท 40 days\nDaily distance = 50 km/day\nTherefore, on the first day (and every other day), the geese traveled 50 km.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
