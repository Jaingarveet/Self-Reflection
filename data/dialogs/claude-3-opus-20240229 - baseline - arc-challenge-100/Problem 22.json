During decomposition, nutrients that were once contained within the living organism are released back into the environment.\n3. These released nutrients can then be used by other living organisms, such as plants, which absorb them through their roots.\n4. This nutrient cycling is essential for maintaining the health and productivity of the ecosystem.\nWhile the other choices mention some benefits of dead trees and limbs, the most important aspect of decomposition in a forest ecosystem is the release and cycling of nutrients.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
