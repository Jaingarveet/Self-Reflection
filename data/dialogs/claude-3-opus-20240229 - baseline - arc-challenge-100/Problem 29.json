Each student should follow the instructions independently.\nB: While a teacher demonstration can be helpful, students should still read and understand the directions themselves before starting. The teacher may not always be available to demonstrate every experiment.\nC: Memorizing instructions is not sufficient. Students need to truly understand each step and the reasons behind them. They may forget memorized steps midway through the experiment.\nD: Reading and understanding all directions before starting the experiment is the best approach. This allows students to clarify any questions, gather necessary materials, and perform each step correctly and safely.\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
