Sedimentary rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organisms.\n2. These rocks or organic materials are broken down into smaller particles through weathering and erosion.\n3. The small particles (sediments) are then transported by water, wind, or ice and deposited in a new location.\n4. Over time, the accumulated sediments are compacted by the weight of the overlying materials.\n5. Finally, the compacted sediments are cemented together by minerals that precipitate from water passing through the spaces between the sediment grains.\nThe first step in this process is the breaking down of rocks or organic materials into smaller particles, which is erosion.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
