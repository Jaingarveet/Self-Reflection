The safest method is to project the Sun's image onto a screen or piece of cardboard.\nWhen using a telescope or binoculars to observe the Sun, a special solar filter must be placed over the front of the instrument to protect the eyes. Never look through a telescope or binoculars at the Sun without a proper solar filter, as the concentrated light can instantly cause permanent blindness.\nProjecting the Sun's image onto a piece of cardboard allows for safe, indirect observation. The Sun's light is passed through the telescope or binoculars and onto the cardboard screen, where details such as sunspots can be seen without risk to the eyes.\nTherefore, the correct precaution when making observations of the Sun is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
