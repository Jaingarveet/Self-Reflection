Smelling a flower does not change the flower into a new substance. This is not a chemical change.\n3. Lighting a candle involves burning the wax, which changes it into new substances (carbon dioxide and water vapor). This is a chemical change.\n4. Coloring a paper blue is just adding a layer of color on top. The paper itself doesn't change into a new substance. This is not a chemical change.\n5. Feeling a rough cloth does not change the cloth into a new substance. This is not a chemical change.\nTherefore, the answer that results in a chemical change is lighting a candle.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
