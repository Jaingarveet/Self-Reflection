Soil with a high humus content will likely have a darker color compared to soil with low humus content.\nB: The mass of the sample\nThe mass of the soil sample alone does not provide a direct indication of humus content, as the mass can be influenced by other factors such as moisture content and mineral composition.\nC: The amount of clay in the sample\nWhile clay content can affect soil properties, it does not directly indicate the amount of humus present in the soil.\nD: The amount of rock in the sample\nThe amount of rock in the soil sample does not directly correlate with humus content, as rocks are inorganic materials that do not contribute to the formation of humus.\nBased on the analysis, the characteristic that best indicates a high humus content in soil is the color of the sample.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
