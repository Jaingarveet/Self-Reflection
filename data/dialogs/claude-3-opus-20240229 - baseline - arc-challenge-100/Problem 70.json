This eliminates choices B and D, as a liquid's shape will change when transferred to a different container or when heated.\n2) A liquid is not easily compressible - its volume does not change much under pressure. This eliminates choice C.\n3) The remaining choice, A, correctly describes a key property of liquids - they maintain a constant volume regardless of the shape or size of their container. The molecules in a liquid are close together but can move around each other, allowing the liquid to flow while maintaining its volume.\nTherefore, the statement that best describes a liquid sample is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
