Looking at the choices:\n   A. Population growth rate is a key aspect that biologists study in animal populations.\n   B. People's opinions on deer watching is not a biological question.\n   C. Deer habitat preferences could be studied by biologists, but the question is not well-framed for a population study in a specific state.\n   D. Whether deer should be pets is not a question biologists would typically study, as it's more of an opinion or ethics question.\n4. Among the given choices, the question that biologists could most likely answer by studying the white-tailed deer population in Ohio is about the population's growth rate.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
