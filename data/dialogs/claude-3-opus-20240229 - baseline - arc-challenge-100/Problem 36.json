Louis Pasteur developed a process that reduces the amount of bacteria in milk. This process is known as pasteurization.\n2. Bacteria in milk can cause various illnesses, such as listeriosis, salmonellosis, and brucellosis, which can lead to serious health problems, especially in children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.\n3. By reducing the amount of bacteria in milk through pasteurization, the risk of contracting these illnesses is significantly reduced.\n4. Pasteurization does not directly help prevent food allergies, encourage people to eat healthy foods, or cure diseases caused by lack of vitamins.\nTherefore, the most likely benefit of Pasteur's process is that it helps keep people from becoming ill by reducing the harmful bacteria in milk.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
