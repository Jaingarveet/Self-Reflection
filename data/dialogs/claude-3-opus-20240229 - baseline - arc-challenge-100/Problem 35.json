The question states that young robins build the same kinds of nests as their parents, even if they have never seen their parents build a nest.\n2. This means that the young birds did not learn how to build the nest by observing their parents. Therefore, it is not a learned behavior, eliminating choice A.\n3. The ability to build the nest without prior observation suggests that the behavior is innate or inborn. This points towards an inherited behavior.\n4. Building a nest is a behavior, not a physical characteristic, eliminating choice C.\n5. An acquired characteristic is a trait that an organism develops during its lifetime, often as a result of environmental factors. Since the young robins have the ability to build the nest from birth, it is not an acquired characteristic, eliminating choice D.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: an inherited behavior. The young robins' ability to build the same kind of nest as their parents without prior observation is an example of an innate, genetically determined behavior.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
