Inherited traits are determined by genes, which are passed from parent to offspring. These traits are not influenced by environmental factors.\n3. Let's look at each choice:\n   A. The number of leaves that fall during winter is influenced by environmental factors like temperature and light, not genes.\n   B. The change in leaf color during autumn is also influenced by environmental factors, mainly the decrease in daylight and temperature.\n   C. The type of mineral absorbed from the soil is determined by the genes of the tree, which control root structure and function.\n   D. The amount of water available for growth is an environmental factor, not an inherited trait.\n4. Among the given choices, only C refers to a trait that is likely determined by the tree's genes and inherited during reproduction.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
