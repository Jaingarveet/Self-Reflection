Plastic is a poor conductor of heat, so it does not keep the wire cool or allow heat to move freely. This eliminates choices A and B.\n2. Plastic does not have inherent magnetic properties, so choice D is incorrect.\n3. Plastic is an excellent electrical insulator. It does not allow electric current to pass through it easily. By wrapping the conducting wire in plastic, the user is protected from electric shock because the plastic prevents the user from coming into direct contact with the live wire.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: the plastic is a good electrical insulator, which protects the user from electric shock.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
