Trout are fish that live and feed in streams, rivers, and lakes, not on forest floors.\n3. Deer mice are small rodents that are commonly found in forests. They forage for seeds, nuts, and insects on the forest floor.\n4. Golden eagles are large birds of prey that typically nest on cliffs or in large trees. They hunt for small to medium-sized mammals in open areas, not on forest floors.\nBased on the habitat and feeding behavior, the animal most likely to be found living and feeding on the forest floors of Virginia is the deer mouse.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
