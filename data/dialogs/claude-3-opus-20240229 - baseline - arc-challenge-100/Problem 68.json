Deer shedding antlers is a seasonal process, not an escape strategy from predators. Eliminate choice A.\n3. Anglerfish producing light is used to attract prey, not escape predators. Eliminate choice C.\n4. Otters producing oil for waterproofing is an adaptation for their aquatic environment, not an escape strategy. Eliminate choice D.\n5. Some newts and lizards are known to drop their tails when threatened by a predator. The detached, wiggling tail can distract the predator, allowing the newt or lizard to escape. This matches the description of an escape strategy.\nTherefore, the best answer is choice B: Newts drop their tails when threatened.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
