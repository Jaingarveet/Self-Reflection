The father contributes genetic material through sperm cells, while the mother contributes genetic material through egg cells.\n3. During fertilization, the sperm and egg combine, resulting in a unique combination of genetic material from both parents.\n4. This means that a child, regardless of their sex, inherits traits from both their father and mother.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that a son can inherit traits from both his father and his mother.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
