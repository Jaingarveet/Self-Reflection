This aligns with the skin's composition and role.\nD) While the skin is indeed part of an organism, this alone doesn't qualify it as an organ.\nThe skin is considered an organ because it is made of multiple types of tissues (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis) that work together to perform various functions such as protection, temperature regulation, and sensation.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
