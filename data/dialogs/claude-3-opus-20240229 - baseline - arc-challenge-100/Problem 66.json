A composite material is made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties that, when combined, produce a material with characteristics different from the individual components.\n2. Glass is made from sand, soda ash, and limestone, but these ingredients chemically react to form a single substance (glass). So a glass window is not a composite.\n3. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Alloys are homogeneous mixtures, not composites. So a bronze statue is not a composite.\n4. Aluminum cans are made from a single material, aluminum. So an aluminum can is not a composite.\n5. Fiberglass is made by reinforcing a plastic matrix with glass fibers. The plastic and glass fibers are distinct components that together provide properties different from either material alone. This is the definition of a composite material.\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
