Rivers contain flowing fresh water, but their total volume is relatively small compared to other reservoirs.\n3. Ice sheets, including glaciers, store a huge amount of fresh water in the form of ice. The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are the largest, holding about 99% of the world's freshwater ice.\n4. Aquifers are underground layers of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials. While they hold a large volume of water, it is not as much as the ice sheets.\nTherefore, the largest volume of fresh water is stored in ice sheets.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
