Sound energy is caused by vibrations, which is a form of motion, so it is kinetic energy.\n4. Radiant energy, such as light or heat, is energy that travels in waves or particles, which is also a form of motion, so it is kinetic energy.\n5. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, so it is kinetic energy.\n6. Chemical energy is the potential energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds, which can be released during chemical reactions.\nTherefore, chemical energy is a type of potential energy.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
