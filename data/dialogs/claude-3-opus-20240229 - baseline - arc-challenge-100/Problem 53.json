The plant uses about 10% of this energy for its life functions. \n   - Remaining energy: 100% - 10% = 90%\n3. The plant transfers approximately another 10% of the energy to consumers in the food chain.\n   - Energy transferred to consumers: 10% of the 90% remaining = 9% of the total\n   - Remaining energy: 90% - 9% = 81%\nSo, 81% of the original energy from the Sun is still unaccounted for. \n4. The energy is not reabsorbed by the Sun, as energy flows in one direction through ecosystems.\n5. Decomposers break down organic matter, releasing nutrients back into the ecosystem, but this doesn't account for the majority of the energy.\n6. Soil does not store energy for later use by the plant.\n7. Most of the energy that is not used by the plant or passed on to consumers is released as heat during the plant's metabolic processes and through the ecosystem's interactions.\nTherefore, most of the remaining energy is released into the ecosystem as heat.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
