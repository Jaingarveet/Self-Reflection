A solid has a definite shape and volume, while a liquid has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container.\n3. The number of atoms in a sample depends on the size (mass) of the sample. A large sample will have more atoms than a small sample.\n4. The amount of energy in a sample depends on factors like temperature and phase (solid, liquid, gas). A liquid sample will have more energy than a solid sample at the same temperature.\n5. The only property that is the same for both the small solid sample and the large liquid sample is the definite volume. Both samples have a fixed volume regardless of their shape or size.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
