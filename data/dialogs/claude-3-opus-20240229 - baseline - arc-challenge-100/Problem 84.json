        "content": "To determine how organic waste from fertilizers commonly affects freshwater ecosystems, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Fertilizers contain nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which help plants grow.\n2. When it rains, these nutrients can run off into nearby freshwater ecosystems like lakes and rivers.\n3. In freshwater, excess nutrients (especially phosphorus) can cause a rapid growth of algae, known as an algal bloom.\n4. Large algal blooms can cover the water surface, blocking sunlight from reaching aquatic plants below.\n5. When the algae die, they are decomposed by bacteria which consume oxygen in the process.\n6. This leads to a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water, a condition known as hypoxia.\n7. Low oxygen levels can stress or kill fish and other aquatic life.\nTherefore, the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly decreases oxygen levels in freshwater ecosystems due to the process of eutrophication and subsequent algal blooms.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
