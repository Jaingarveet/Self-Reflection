        "content": "To determine the correct answer, let's think through the process of planetary formation and the effects of heating:\n1. Planets formed from the accretion of dust and gas in the early solar system.\n2. As the planets grew in size, the increasing pressure and radioactive decay caused the planets to heat up.\n3. The heating caused the planets to melt, allowing denser materials to sink to the center and lighter materials to rise to the surface.\n4. This process, known as differentiation, resulted in the formation of distinct layers within the planets, such as the core, mantle, and crust.\nThe heating of the planets during formation did not cause:\n- An increase in their masses (A)\n- The loss of most radioactive isotopes (B)\n- The planets to start revolving around the Sun (D)\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\nThe heating of the planets during formation caused their structures to differentiate into distinct layers."
