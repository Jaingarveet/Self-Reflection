During photosynthesis, green plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air through their leaves.\n2. Using energy from sunlight, water from the soil, and the absorbed CO2, plants produce glucose (a simple sugar) and oxygen (O2).\n3. The oxygen produced during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere through the leaves.\n4. This process helps maintain the balance of CO2 and O2 in the Earth's atmosphere.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that green plants release oxygen into the air as a byproduct of photosynthesis, making them an essential part of the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
