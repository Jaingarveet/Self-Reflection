        "content": "To determine the process the students were observing, let's consider each choice:\nA. Oxidizing: This is a chemical reaction where a substance combines with oxygen. It doesn't directly cause cracks in rocks or allow trees to grow out of them.\nB. Deposition: This is the process by which sediments, soil, or rocks are added to a landform. It doesn't cause cracks in rocks or enable tree growth in those cracks.\nC. Weathering: This is the process where rocks are broken down by the action of physical, chemical, or biological forces. Over time, weathering can cause cracks in rocks. If soil accumulates in these cracks, it can support the growth of vegetation like trees.\nD. Decomposition: This is the process by which organic matter is broken down into simpler forms of matter. It doesn't typically involve inorganic materials like rocks.\nThe best answer is C, weathering. The crack in the boulder was likely caused by physical weathering processes like freeze-thaw cycles or biological weathering from plant roots. The tree growing out of the crack suggests that soil has accumulated there due to the weathering, allowing the tree to take root.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
