Let's consider each choice:\n   A. Making cars run on less fuel - This could help reduce emissions and conserve fossil fuels, which are important environmental issues.\n   B. Finding more sites for copper mines - Mining can have significant environmental impacts and is not directly focused on solving environmental problems.\n   C. Making ocean liners bigger and faster - This is not directly related to environmental issues and could potentially increase emissions.\n   D. Replacing human workers with robots - While automation is an important topic, it's not directly related to environmental concerns.\n3. Among the given choices, making cars run on less fuel (Choice A) is the most closely aligned with studying and addressing environmental issues. It could lead to reduced emissions and help conserve limited resources.\nTherefore, the best answer is Choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
