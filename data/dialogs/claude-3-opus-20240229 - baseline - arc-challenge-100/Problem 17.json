The fossil has much longer tusks and is much larger than the elephant species currently living in the area.\n3. The fact that the fossil is different from the present-day elephants suggests that changes have occurred in the elephant population over time.\n4. The longer tusks and larger size are physical characteristics that differ from the elephants now inhabiting the area.\n5. The fossil provides evidence of how the physical characteristics of elephants have changed over time in this location.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nThe elephant fossil most likely reveals that physical changes occurred in elephants over time."
