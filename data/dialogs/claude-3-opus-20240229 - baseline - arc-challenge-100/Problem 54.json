We know that gases can diffuse and spread out to fill the available space. This is why the smell can reach all the students.\n3. Choice A is incorrect because gases do have mass, although it is much less dense than liquids or solids.\n4. Choice B is also incorrect because gases have a very low mass compared to liquids and solids.\n5. Choice C correctly describes a property of gases - they do not have a fixed shape and will spread out to take the shape of their container (in this case, the classroom).\n6. Choice D is incorrect because gases do not keep a fixed shape when placed in a container.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: A gas takes the shape of its container.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
