When the sugar is dissolved, it becomes part of the solution. It doesn't disappear or evaporate.\n4. So, the total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of sugar and the mass of water.\n5. Total mass = Mass of sugar + Mass of water\n              = 10 g + 100 g\n              = 110 g\nTherefore, the sugar-and-water solution has a mass of 110 grams.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
