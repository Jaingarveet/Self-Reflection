The pan is being heated by conduction from direct contact with the hot stove burner. This is not convection.\n3. The metal spoon is also being heated by conduction when it comes into contact with the hot soup. This is not convection either.\n4. The stove burner is heating up due to electrical resistance. This is not convection.\n5. The soup, however, is a liquid. As it heats, the hotter, less dense portions of the soup rise, while the cooler, denser portions sink. This creates a circulatory motion that transfers heat throughout the soup. This is convection.\nTherefore, the heating of the soup is the example of heat transfer by convection.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
