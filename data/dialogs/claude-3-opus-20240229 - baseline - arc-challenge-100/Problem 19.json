Steel cans: Steel is a durable material that can be melted down and reformed into new products multiple times without losing its quality.\n2. Glass bottles: Glass can be recycled indefinitely without losing its purity or quality. It can be melted and remolded into new bottles or other glass products.\n3. Paper containers: Paper fibers become shorter each time they are recycled, limiting the number of times paper can be reused. Eventually, the fibers become too short to create new paper products.\n4. Plastic containers: While plastic can be recycled, the quality degrades each time it is reprocessed. This limits the number of times it can be recycled compared to glass or steel.\nConsidering the information above, both steel cans and glass bottles can be recycled and reused many times without significant loss in quality.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
