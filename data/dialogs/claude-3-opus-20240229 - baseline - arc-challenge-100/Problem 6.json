Density is defined as mass per unit volume. If the two pieces have the same density and mass, they must also have the same volume.\n3. The amount of matter per unit volume is the definition of density. Since the density is the same for both pieces, choice D cannot be the answer.\n4. If the two pieces are made of the same metal, they are made up of the same type of matter. Therefore, choice C is not the correct answer.\n5. Boiling point is a characteristic property of a substance. If the two pieces are the same metal, they will have the same boiling point. Thus, choice B is not the answer.\n6. If the two pieces have the same mass and density but are not identical, the only characteristic that can be different is their shape or dimensions.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: They have different dimensions.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
