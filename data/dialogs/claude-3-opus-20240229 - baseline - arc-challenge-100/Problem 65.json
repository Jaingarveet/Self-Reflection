Size alone doesn't explain the apparent difference.\nB: The sky is much darker at night.\nThe darker sky allows us to see the stars, but it doesn't directly affect their apparent size.\nC: The stars are much farther away.\nThis is the key factor. The sun is our closest star, at about 93 million miles away. Other stars are incredibly distant, often many light-years away. This vast distance makes them appear as tiny points of light, even though many are as large as or larger than the sun.\nD: The moon blocks out most starlight.\nThe moon can make some stars harder to see due to its brightness, but it doesn't block out most starlight or make the stars look smaller.\nTherefore, the best explanation is that the stars appear much smaller than the sun because they are much farther away.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
