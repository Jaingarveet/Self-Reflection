It is an inherited trait.\n4. Intelligence is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. While there may be some genetic components, intelligence is heavily influenced by factors like education, upbringing, and personal experiences. It is not considered a purely inherited trait like height, hair color, or skin color.\nTherefore, among the given choices, intelligence is the trait that is not strictly inherited.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
