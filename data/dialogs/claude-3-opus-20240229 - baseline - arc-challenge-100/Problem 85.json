Galaxies rotate in different directions depending on various factors, such as their formation history and interactions with other galaxies. There is no universal direction of rotation for galaxies.\n3. The number of stars in galaxies varies greatly. Some galaxies have billions of stars, while others have only millions. The Milky Way is estimated to have between 100 to 400 billion stars.\n4. All galaxies, including the Milky Way, are composed of similar basic elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of heavier elements. These elements were formed in the early universe and through stellar nucleosynthesis.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the Milky Way Galaxy and other galaxies in the universe have similar elements in common.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
