It is a more general process.\nB: Self-pollination involves the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or another flower on the same plant. This is more similar to asexual reproduction, as it does not involve the combination of genetic material from two different individuals.\nC: Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one plant to the stigma of a flower on another plant. This process involves the combination of genetic material from two different individuals, which is the key characteristic of sexual reproduction in vertebrates.\nD: Seed development occurs after fertilization, which is a result of sexual reproduction in plants. However, the process itself is not directly comparable to sexual reproduction in vertebrates.\nTherefore, the process in plants that is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates is cross-pollination.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
