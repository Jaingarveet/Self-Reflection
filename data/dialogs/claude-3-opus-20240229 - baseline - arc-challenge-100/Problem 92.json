Over the last 150 years, the use of fossil fuels has increased, resulting in more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some scientists think that these atmospheric gases will result in global warming. Scientists have recorded data on global temperature changes and have predicted possible changes in sea level that may affect Maryland residents. Which result of global warming will most negatively affect coastal residents in Maryland?\nChoices:\n  A: loss of shore land\n  B: erosion of mountains\n  C: decrease in average temperature\n  D: increase in the size of the polar ice caps\n"

Maryland is a coastal state, with a significant portion of its land bordering the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay.\n3. If global warming causes sea levels to rise, it would most directly impact areas closest to the coast.\n4. Among the choices given, the one that would most negatively affect coastal residents in Maryland is the loss of shore land.\n5. Erosion of mountains, decrease in average temperature, and increase in the size of polar ice caps are not directly related to the sea level rise that would impact Maryland's coastal areas.\nTherefore, the result of global warming that will most negatively affect coastal residents in Maryland is the loss of shore land.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
