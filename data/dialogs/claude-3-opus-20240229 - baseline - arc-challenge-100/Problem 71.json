Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) is a technique that uses sound waves to navigate, communicate, or detect objects underwater.\n2. The sonar equipment sends out sound waves into the water. These waves travel through the water until they encounter an object or the seabed.\n3. When the sound waves hit an object or the seabed, they are reflected back towards the source (the sonar equipment).\n4. The sonar equipment then detects these reflected waves. It measures the time taken for the sound wave to travel to the object and back.\n5. By calculating the time interval between the transmitted and reflected waves, and knowing the speed of sound in water, the distance to the object can be determined.\nTherefore, sonar equipment measures the time delay of the reflected waves to calculate the distance to objects underwater.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
