The Sun has been in this main-sequence phase for about 4.6 billion years.\n3. Based on our understanding of stellar evolution, a star with the mass of the Sun will spend approximately 10 billion years in the main sequence phase.\n4. Since the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old, it has spent roughly half of its time in the main sequence phase.\n5. When the Sun exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it will exit the main sequence and enter later stages of its life cycle.\nTherefore, the most accurate statement about the Sun is that it has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
