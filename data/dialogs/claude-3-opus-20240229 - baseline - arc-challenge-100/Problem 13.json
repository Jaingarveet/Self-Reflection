Objects with the same volume can have different masses and thus exert different gravitational forces.\nB: Weight - Weight is a measure of the force of gravity acting on an object. It depends on the object's mass and the strength of the gravitational field it is in. However, the gravitational force an object exerts on other objects depends on its own intrinsic property, not the force acting on it.\nC: Mass - According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses. The more mass an object has, the greater the gravitational force it exerts.\nD: Size - The size or shape of an object does not directly determine its gravitational force. Objects of the same size can have different masses and thus exert different gravitational forces.\nTherefore, the gravitational force exerted by an object depends on its mass.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
