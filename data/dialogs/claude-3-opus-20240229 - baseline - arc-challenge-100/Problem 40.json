One complete rotation of Earth on its axis takes approximately 24 hours, which is the length of a day.\n3. As Earth rotates, different parts of the planet face the Sun, experiencing daylight, while the opposite side experiences night.\n4. The other choices (seasons, months, and moon phases) are caused by different movements or take longer periods of time:\n   - Seasons change due to Earth's tilt and its orbit around the Sun, which takes a year.\n   - Months are a human construct and not directly related to Earth's rotation.\n   - Moon phases are caused by the Moon's orbit around Earth, which takes about a month.\nTherefore, the change that could be seen on Earth in the time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis is day becoming night.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
