Natural gas: When burned, it produces CO2, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. However, it doesn't produce long-lasting radioactive waste.\nB. Uranium: Used in nuclear power plants, it produces radioactive waste that can remain hazardous for thousands of years.\nC. Crude oil: When refined and burned, it produces CO2 and other pollutants. However, its waste products don't have the same long-term impact as radioactive waste.\nD. Coal: Burning coal produces CO2, sulfur dioxide, and other pollutants. While these have significant environmental impacts, they don't last as long as radioactive waste.\nAmong these options, uranium stands out as the energy source that produces waste products with the longest-lasting negative effects due to the longevity of radioactive waste.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
