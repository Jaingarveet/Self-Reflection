        "content": "To determine which area is most likely to form metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist, let's consider the conditions required for metamorphic rock formation:\n1. Metamorphic rocks form when pre-existing rocks are subjected to high temperatures and/or pressures, causing them to change their physical and/or chemical properties without melting.\n2. These conditions are typically found deep within the Earth's crust, where rocks are subjected to high pressures from the weight of overlying rocks and high temperatures from the Earth's internal heat.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA. A sea floor: While the pressure at the bottom of the ocean can be high, the temperatures are generally not high enough to cause significant metamorphism.\nB. A windblown desert: Desert environments are characterized by high temperatures but low pressures, which are not conducive to metamorphic rock formation.\nC. A site deep underground: Deep underground, rocks are subjected to both high pressures from the weight of overlying rocks and high temperatures from the Earth's internal heat. These conditions are ideal for the formation of metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist.\nD. A site covered by a glacier: Glaciers can exert high pressures on the rocks beneath them, but the temperatures are generally too low for significant metamorphism to occur.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
