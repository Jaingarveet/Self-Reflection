A physical change is a change in the physical properties of a substance, such as its shape, size, or state of matter, without changing its chemical composition. A chemical change, on the other hand, is a change in the chemical composition of a substance, resulting in the formation of a new substance with different properties.\n\nIn the context of digestion, a physical change would involve the breakdown of food into smaller pieces without changing its chemical composition. The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change, as it only changes the physical properties of the food without changing its chemical composition. The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) and the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) are both chemical changes, as they involve the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions. The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is also a physical change, as it only changes the physical properties of the food without changing its chemical composition.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
