        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted \"as it is\" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible \"reality\" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: \"The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.\" The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art \"a shameful destiny.\" A literary work must stand or fall on its \"artistic merit,\" he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is \"artistic\" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: \"To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.\" The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be \"useful\" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.\n  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.\n  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.\n  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.\n  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.\n\nTo determine the organization of the passage, let's break it down:\n1. The passage introduces two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time:\n   a) Art should stand above everyday reality\n   b) Art should be grounded in concrete reality and contribute to creating a new society (be useful)\n2. Dostoyevsky's third position is then introduced. The rest of the passage elaborates on his view:\n   - As a realist, he believed reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper\n   - He saw no distinction between fantasy and reality\n   - Reality is shaped by the person who experiences it\n   - The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world\n   - Art should be judged on its \"artistic merit\", not its political utility\n   - Artistic merit means the ability to express thoughts well in characters and images\n   - The usefulness of art can't always be measured precisely\n3. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated in detail from the two introduced at the beginning, especially the radical view that art must be useful.\nTherefore, the passage presents three positions, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the first two in detail.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly identified the passage as differentiating Dostoyevsky's position from both of the other two positions in detail. Upon re-reading, I see that while the passage does mention the first position briefly, it only goes into detail differentiating Dostoyevsky's view from the second, radical position. The first position is not elaborated on significantly.\nError Keywords:\n - Reading comprehension error\n - Passage structure misinterpretation \n - Failure to distinguish levels of detail given to different points\nSolution:\n1. The passage introduces two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism:\n   a) Art should stand above everyday reality (not elaborated in detail)\n   b) Art should be grounded in concrete reality and be useful to society (radical view)\n2. Dostoyevsky's third position is then introduced and elaborated in detail:\n   - Reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper\n   - No distinction between fantasy and reality; reality shaped by the experiencer\n   - Writer's task is to explode boundaries of the so-called real world\n   - Art should be judged on \"artistic merit\", not political utility\n   - Artistic merit means expressing thoughts well in characters and images\n   - Usefulness of art can't always be precisely measured\n3. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated in detail primarily from the second, radical position. The first position is not significantly elaborated on.\nTherefore, the passage presents three positions, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the second radical position in detail.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully, identifying the main positions or arguments presented.\n2. Note how much detail is provided for each position.\n3. Determine which positions are elaborated on and which are mentioned more briefly.\n4. Identify any positions that are directly compared or contrasted.\n5. Determine which position, if any, is given the most detailed treatment.\n6. Select the answer choice that best captures the structure you've identified.\nAdvice:\n - Always read passages carefully, taking note of the main ideas and how they are developed.\n - Pay attention to the level of detail given to each idea to understand their relative importance.\n - Look for direct comparisons or contrasts between ideas, as these often indicate the passage's structure.\n - Don't assume ideas are elaborated equally; some may be explained in more depth than others.\n - Make sure your answer choice accurately reflects the structure you've identified in the passage."
