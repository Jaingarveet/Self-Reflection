        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of \"points of identification\" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent \"points and characteristics\" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints \"match.\" There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a \"point-counting\" method that entails counting the number of similar \"ridge\" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles underlies the arguments in both passages?\nChoices:\n  A: Courts should be extremely reluctant to reject those forms of evidence that have withstood the test of time.\n  B: Defendants should have the right to challenge forms of evidence whose reliability has not been scientifically proven.\n  C: To evaluate the value of fingerprint evidence, one must know how likely it is that partial prints from two different people would match.\n  D: Fingerprint identification should not be considered to have a low error rate Wlless rigorously conducted tests have shown this to be so.\n  E: Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards iffingerprint identification is to be reliable.\n\nTo determine the principle underlying the arguments in both passages, I'll analyze the main points of each:\nPassage A:\n- Argues that fingerprint evidence should be admissible despite lack of scientific testing\n- Cites the long history of fingerprint evidence use in trials as evidence of reliability\n- Acknowledges lack of uniform standards but argues fingerprint examiners still follow a consistent approach\n- Concludes the trial court was right to accept testimony that fingerprint ID has a low error rate\nPassage B:\n- Argues there are no objective standards for declaring fingerprint matches\n- Points out the lack of data on how likely partial prints from different people could match\n- Contends that without this data, the value of fingerprint evidence can't be properly assessed\n- Cites the lack of studies on error rates and suggests some proficiency tests are not rigorous enough\nThe common thread is that both passages discuss the need to know the likelihood of partial prints from different people matching in order to properly evaluate fingerprint evidence. Passage A dismisses this concern by citing the long history of fingerprint evidence use, while Passage B emphasizes it as a critical flaw. But both acknowledge this as a key issue.\nTherefore, the principle underlying both passages is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI focused too narrowly on the discussion of error rates and the likelihood of partial prints matching between the two passages. While this was a common point, it was not the overarching principle connecting their arguments.\nLooking more broadly, both passages are fundamentally concerned with the lack of objective standards in fingerprint examination and identification. Passage A acknowledges this issue but argues it is outweighed by the long history of fingerprint evidence use. Passage B cites it as a critical problem that undermines the reliability of fingerprint evidence.\nSo the core principle underlying both of their arguments is that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. They just disagree on whether the current lack of fully objective standards is disqualifying or not.\nError Keywords:\n - Focusing on a minor detail instead of the overarching principle\n - Failing to synthesize arguments holistically \n - Misidentifying the common thread between passages\nSolution:\nPassage A argues that fingerprint evidence should be admissible despite some open questions about its scientific basis. It acknowledges there are no uniform, objective standards that specify the number of matching points required to declare a fingerprint match. However, it contends that fingerprint examiners still follow a consistent approach and that the long history of fingerprint evidence use in trials demonstrates its underlying reliability.\nPassage B argues that fingerprint evidence is unreliable because fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for declaring a match between two prints. It states there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, with practices varying between jurisdictions. The passage emphasizes that without data on how likely partial prints from different people are to match, the value of fingerprint evidence cannot be properly evaluated. It suggests error rates are understudied and some proficiency tests are not rigorous.\nWhile the two passages come to different conclusions, they both agree on the key principle that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. Passage A believes the lack of fully uniform standards is not disqualifying given fingerprinting's long history, while Passage B sees it as a critical flaw. But both share the underlying premise that objective standards are important for assessing the reliability of fingerprint examination.\nInstructions:\n1. Read both passages carefully and identify their key arguments.\n2. Look for common themes or principles that underlie the arguments in both passages, even if the passages come to different conclusions.\n3. Differentiate between minor details discussed in both passages and the overarching principles motivating their arguments.\n4. Synthesize the arguments holistically to determine what core premise or assumption both passages share, even if they build different cases on that foundation.\n5. Select the answer choice that best captures this common underlying principle.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the passages closely, but focus on discerning their high-level arguments and motivations, not just the specific details they discuss.\n - Look for thematic similarities between the passages' lines of argument, even when they reach different ultimate conclusions.\n - Differentiate between minor overlapping details and the core principles underlying both passages' reasoning.\n - Synthesize the arguments from a bird's-eye view to identify the key premises or assumptions both passages build upon.\n - Select an answer that captures the common foundation of the passages' arguments, not just a detail they both mention in passing."
