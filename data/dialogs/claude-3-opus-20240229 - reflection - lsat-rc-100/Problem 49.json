        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term \"proverb\" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, \"Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are.\" Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly implied by the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners, then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition.\n  B: The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.\n  C: The ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.\n  D: There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.\n  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.\n\nTo determine the answer most strongly implied by the passage, let's analyze each choice:\nA) The passage does not suggest that proverbs used to teach table manners primarily serve to maintain ethnic traditions. This is not implied.\nB) The passage states that proverbs \"serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture\" and \"provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.\" This strongly implies that proverb use conveys a sense of ethnicity to children in the community.\nC) While the passage mentions that many proverbs used by Mexican Americans come from Spain and are part of a common European tradition, it does not claim that the ways Mexican Americans use these proverbs are typical of all Spanish speakers worldwide.\nD) The passage does state that proverbs are \"self-contained sayings that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context\" and that \"each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context.\" However, this is presented as factual information rather than a strong implication.\nE) Although the passage notes an emphasis on using proverbs to regulate peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities, it does not clearly state that this emphasis distinguishes these communities from others in the U.S.\nConsidering the analysis above, choice B is most strongly implied by the information given in the passage.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly focused on the idea that proverb use conveys a sense of ethnicity to children in Mexican American communities. While the passage does discuss this, it is not the most strongly implied point. I overlooked the more fundamental implication about the nature of proverbs themselves.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpreting main implication \n - Focusing on supporting detail instead of main point\n - Overlooking key definitional information\nSolution:\nThe passage states: \"The term 'proverb' refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom.\" It then goes on to say: \"Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.\"\nTaken together, these two statements most strongly imply choice D: \"There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.\" This is a direct restatement of the key definitional points made about proverbs in the passage.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question stem carefully to identify what is being asked (e.g., main point, implication, etc.).\n2. Re-read the passage, highlighting or underlining key definitional statements or explanations of core concepts.\n3. Analyze each answer choice in turn, referring back to the highlighted portions of the passage.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly supported by the passage.\n5. Select the answer choice that most closely matches or restates the key ideas in the passage, with a focus on what is most strongly implied rather than merely mentioned.\nAdvice:\n - Always pay close attention to sentences that define key terms or explain important concepts, as these often contain the main ideas of the passage.\n - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is mentioned in the passage; look for the choice that is most strongly implied or supported by the passage as a whole.\n - If you're torn between two answers, refer back to the question stem to determine which one is a better fit for what is being asked.\n - Don't make assumptions or read things into the passage that aren't there; stick closely to what is directly stated or implied."
