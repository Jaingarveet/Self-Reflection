Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe average speed for the combined activities can be calculated by adding the speeds of both activities and dividing by the total time taken.\n\nMiles run in 4 hours = M\nMiles biked in 4 hours = N\n\nTotal distance covered = M + N\nTotal time taken = 4 hours\n\nAverage speed = Total distance / Total time\n= (M + N) / 4\n= M + N / 4\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) M + N / 4."
