I misunderstood the problem and thought it was only based on the percentage of monthly sales.\n\nTo find the monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500, we need to first calculate the fixed salary of $500.\n\nFixed salary = $500\n\nNow, we need to calculate the percentage of monthly sales based on the given percentage (5%).\n\nPercentage of monthly sales = 5%\n\nMonthly sales = fixed salary + percentage of monthly sales\n= $500 + ($500 x 5%)\n= $500 + $250\n= $750\n\nTherefore, the monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500 is $750.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
