To form a unique bike number, the letters must be distinct, and the numbers must be unique.\n\nSolution:\nThe total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is 74453.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The letters can be any combination of 26 letters, so there are 26 x 26 = 676 possible combinations of letters.\n2. For each combination of letters, there are 10 possible numbers that can be used, so there are 676 x 10 = 6760 possible bike numbers.\n\nHowever, some of these bike numbers may be duplicates, so we need to subtract the number of duplicates to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\nTo find the number of duplicates, we can use the following logic:\n\n* If the letters are the same, the bike numbers are duplicates.\n* If the numbers are the same, the bike numbers are duplicates.\n\nUsing this logic, we can eliminate duplicates and find the total number of distinct bike numbers.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
