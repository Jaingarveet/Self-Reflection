How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?\nChoices:\n  A: 1\n  B: 240\n  C: 30\n  D: 60\n  E: 120\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it would take to travel 48 miles at a constant speed of 12 miles per hour, which is not the correct approach.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed. In this case, the distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 miles per hour.\n\nSo, the correct answer is: Time = 48 miles / 12 miles/hour = 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) 60 minutes."
