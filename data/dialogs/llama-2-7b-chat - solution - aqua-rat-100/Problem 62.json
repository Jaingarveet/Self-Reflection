How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.\nChoices:\n  A: 2 miles\n  B: 2.25 miles\n  C: 3.25 miles\n  D: 3.85 miles\n  E: 2.85 miles\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nBill's average speed on a normal day is 15 mph, and on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. To find the distance traveled in 21 minutes, we need to calculate the total time taken to travel a certain distance at a reduced speed.\n\nAction:\nLet's first calculate the time taken to travel a distance of 1 mile at a reduced speed of 11 mph (15 mph - 4 mph).\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 11 mph = 0.09 miles/minute\n\nNow, we know that Bill travels for 21 minutes, so the total distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = Time x Speed = 0.09 miles/minute x 21 minutes = 1.89 miles\n\nAction:\nNow, let's choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n\nAnswer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], as it is the closest estimate to the actual distance traveled by Bill in 21 minutes, which is 1.89 miles.\n"
