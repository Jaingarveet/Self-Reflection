If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand where I went wrong. Here's my reflection:\n\nI misunderstood the problem and thought the ages were given in a linear sequence instead of an arithmetic progression. I calculated the sum of the ages incorrectly and arrived at an incorrect answer.\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, I will use the formula for the nth term of an A.P.:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nwhere a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\n\nGiven that the youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of the ages is 250, we can set up the equation:\n\n7 + (n - 1) Ã— 3 = 250\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn = 26\n\nTherefore, there are 26 members in the club.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
