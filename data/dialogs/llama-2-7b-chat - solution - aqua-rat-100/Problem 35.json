To calculate the required monthly sale, I will use the formula: Monthly sale = Monthly salary + Commission.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation: The monthly salary of the servant is 1500 Rupees, and the commission is 15% of the monthly sale. To find the required monthly sale, I will multiply the monthly salary by 1.15 (15% of 1500). Therefore, the required monthly sale is:\n\nMonthly sale = 1500 x 1.15 = 17250 Rupees\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 31500 Rupees."
