I will carefully review the problem and my solution to determine the correct answer.\n\nReflection: The problem states that the man divided Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five times as much as each nephew.\n\nTo calculate the amount each daughter receives, I will use the information that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew. So, if each nephew receives Rs x, each daughter receives Rs 4x.\n\nNext, I will use the information that each son receives five times as much as each nephew. So, if each nephew receives Rs x, each son receives Rs 5x.\n\nI will now use these calculations to determine the amount each daughter receives:\n\nRs x (received by each nephew) x 4 (received by each daughter) = Rs 4x\n\nRs 4x (received by each daughter) x 5 (received by each son) = Rs 20x\n\nNow, I will substitute the value of x (which is the amount each nephew receives) into the second equation:\n\nRs 4x (received by each daughter) x 5 (received by each son) = Rs 20x\n\nRs 4x = Rs 20x\n\nRs x = Rs 5x\n\nSo, each daughter receives Rs 5x.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
