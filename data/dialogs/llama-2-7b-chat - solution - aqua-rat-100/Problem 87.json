There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to arrange 2 of them in a particular order. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket is:\n\n10C2 = 10 × 9 = [REDACTED]\n"

        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem using the principle of permutations!\n\nTo find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the formula:\n\nNumber of ways = Number of objects × Number of choices\n\nIn this case, there are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to choose 2 of them. So, the formula becomes:\n\nNumber of ways = 10 × 9\n\nNow, we need to simplify the formula by multiplying the number of objects (10) by the number of choices (9):\n\nNumber of ways = 10 × 9 = 90\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 90.\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and used the formula for the number of combinations instead of the number of permutations. Thank you for pointing out my mistake, and I'm glad I could correct it!"
