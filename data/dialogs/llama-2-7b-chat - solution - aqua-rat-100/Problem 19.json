I will carefully review the problem and my previous solution to determine the correct answer.\n\nReflection: The problem states that the jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, and during the return journey, it increases its speed by 12km/hr. To find the distance traveled by the jeep, I will use the formula: distance = speed x time.\n\nIn the forward journey, the jeep travels a distance of:\ndistance = speed x time = 60 km/hr x 6 hours = 360 km\n\nDuring the return journey, the jeep travels a distance of:\ndistance = speed x time = 72 km/hr x 4 hours = 288 km\n\nTherefore, the total distance traveled by the jeep is:\ntotal distance = forward distance + return distance = 360 km + 288 km = 648 km\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
