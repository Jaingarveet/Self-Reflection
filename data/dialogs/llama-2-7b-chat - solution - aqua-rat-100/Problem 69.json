Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the correct answer:\n\nThought:\nYou correctly identified that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction can be calculated by subtracting the number of hardcover books and fiction books from the total number of books.\n\nAction:\nYou answered choice D, which is the correct answer. The maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 0.\n\nWell done! It's important to reflect on our mistakes and use them as opportunities to learn and improve.
