I reflected on my solution and the correct answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the total number of marbles in the bag before the first pull, and then calculate the number of black marbles after the first pull. We can use the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time to find the total number of black marbles in the bag.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
