How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly as B: y3/x2 units. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is C: x3/y2 units.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe problem states that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. To find the work that y men working y hours per day can do in y days, we need to scale the work done by x men by y/x.\n\nSo, the work done by y men in y days is:\n\ny men working y hours per day = x men working x hours per day x y/x = x3/y2 units\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: x3/y2 units.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
