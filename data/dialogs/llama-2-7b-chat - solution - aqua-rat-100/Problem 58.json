I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it takes for one ball to make a full rotation, which is not the correct approach.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the question:\n\n* Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.\n* Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.\n\nI will start by calculating the time it takes for Ball A to make one full rotation:\n\n26 minutes / 2 = 13 minutes per full rotation\n\nNow, I will calculate the time it takes for Ball B to make one full rotation:\n\n35 minutes / 5 = 7 minutes per full rotation\n\nSince both balls start rotating from the same point, they will be at the same starting point again after:\n\nBall A: 13 minutes + 13 minutes = 26 minutes\nBall B: 7 minutes + 7 minutes = 14 minutes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 2 hours and 31 minutes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
