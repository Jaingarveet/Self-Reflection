I realized that I misunderstood the problem and calculated the percentage incorrectly.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n* 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.\n* 90% of the rest are squashed.\n\nSo, the total number of chocolates that are not squashed is:\n90% of 100 = 90\n\nNow, we need to find the number of vanilla flavored chocolates among the non-squashed chocolates:\n\n* 10% of the non-squashed chocolates are vanilla flavored.\n* 90% of the non-squashed chocolates are not vanilla flavored.\n\nSo, the number of vanilla flavored chocolates among the non-squashed chocolates is:\n10% of 90 = 9\n\nNow, we can find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed:\n\nPercentage = (number of vanilla flavored chocolates among non-squashed chocolates) / (total number of non-squashed chocolates)\n= (9) / (90)\n= 10%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
