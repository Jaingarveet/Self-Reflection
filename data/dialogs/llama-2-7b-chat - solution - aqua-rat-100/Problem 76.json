I misunderstood the problem and ended up with an incorrect solution. To solve this problem correctly, I need to pay closer attention to the given information and use the correct mathematical operations.\n\nHere is my revised solution:\n\nLet n be the number that satisfies 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Then, we can write the equation:\n\nx = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)\n\nWe are asked to find the value of x that satisfies the inequality given in the choices.\n\nA: 20 < x < 54\n\nWe can see that 20 < n < 54, so the expression inside the parentheses is:\n\nn2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16\n\n= n2 + 2n + 16\n\n= n(n + 2) + 16\n\nSince n is between 20 and 54, the value of n(n + 2) is between 40 and 112, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 40 and 112, inclusive.\n\nB: 23 < x < 58\n\nWe can repeat the same calculation as before:\n\nn2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16\n= n2 + 2n + 16\n= n(n + 2) + 16\n\nSince n is between 23 and 58, the value of n(n + 2) is between 46 and 126, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 46 and 126, inclusive.\n\nC: 25 < x < 64\n\nAgain, we can calculate the expression inside the parentheses:\n\nn2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16\n= n2 + 2n + 16\n= n(n + 2) + 16\n\nSince n is between 25 and 64, the value of n(n + 2) is between 50 and 136, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 50 and 136, inclusive.\n\nD: 28 < x < 60\n\nWe can repeat the same calculation as before:\n\nn2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16\n= n2 + 2n + 16\n= n(n + 2) + 16\n\nSince n is between 28 and 60, the value of n(n + 2) is between 44 and 120, inclusive. Therefore, the value of x is between 44 and 120, inclusive.\n\nE: None of these\n\nSince none of the choices match the value of x that we calculated, the answer is E: None of these.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (E) None of these."
