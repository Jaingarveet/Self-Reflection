What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that my solution was not correct. I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\n\nThe problem states that 1/4 inch on the map represents an actual distance of 10 miles. This means that the actual distance on the map is 20 inches / 4 = 5 miles.\n\nHowever, I made a mistake in my previous answer by not taking into account the conversion from inches to miles. The actual distance from Town F to Town G is 5 miles x 10 miles/inch = 50 miles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 1140 miles.\n\n[REDACTED]"
