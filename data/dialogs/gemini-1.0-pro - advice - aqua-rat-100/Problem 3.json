        "content": "Self-reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the relationship between the area of the triangles and the dimensions of the original square. I also made a mistake in my calculations.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to:\n1. Determine the side length of the original square.\n2. Calculate the perimeter of the original square.\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n1. **Determine the side length of the original square.**\nThe area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Since the triangles are formed by cutting a square diagonally in half, the area of the original square is twice the area of one triangle. Therefore, the area of the original square is 2 * 70 = 140 square feet.\nThe side length of a square is the square root of its area. Therefore, the side length of the original square is sqrt(140) = 11.83 feet (rounded to two decimal places).\n2. **Calculate the perimeter of the original square.**\nThe perimeter of a square is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal in length, the perimeter of the original square is 4 * 11.83 = 47.32 feet (rounded to two decimal places).\nTherefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth was 47.32 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
