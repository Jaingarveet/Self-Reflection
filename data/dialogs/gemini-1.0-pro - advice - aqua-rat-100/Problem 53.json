        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** 62, 35\n**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:**\nMy previous solution involved setting up two equations based on the given information:\n1. Sajal + 30 = 2 * (Arjun - 30)\n2. Arjun + 10 = 3 * (Sajal - 10)\nHowever, I made a mistake in manipulating these equations. When solving for Arjun in the first equation, I incorrectly subtracted 30 from both sides instead of adding 30. This led to an incorrect value for Arjun and consequently an incorrect answer for Sajal.\n**Corrected Solution:**\n1. Sajal + 30 = 2 * (Arjun - 30)\n2. Arjun + 10 = 3 * (Sajal - 10)\nSolving for Arjun in the first equation:\nArjun = (Sajal + 30) / 2 + 30\nSubstituting this value of Arjun into the second equation:\n((Sajal + 30) / 2 + 30) + 10 = 3 * (Sajal - 10)\nSimplifying and solving for Sajal:\nSajal = 62\nSubstituting Sajal back into the first equation to solve for Arjun:\nArjun = (62 + 30) / 2 + 30 = 61\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")**"
