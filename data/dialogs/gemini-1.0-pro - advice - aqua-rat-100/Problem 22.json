I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the total number of hours worked by Alex and Jacob incorrectly.\n* **Reason:** I added the time taken by each person to make one toy instead of multiplying it by the number of toys they made.\n* **Correction:** I need to multiply the time taken by each person to make one toy by the number of toys they made to get the total time they worked.\n**Solution:**\n* Alex takes 7 hours to make one toy, and he made 35 toys, so he worked for 7 * 35 = 245 hours.\n* Jacob takes 9 hours to make one toy, and he made 35 toys, so he worked for 9 * 35 = 315 hours.\n* Therefore, Jacob made 35 - 245 = 70 toys.\n**Answer:**\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
