        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C\n**Reasoning:** I incorrectly calculated the amount each person would need to contribute after four people didn't show up. I divided the total cost (Rs. 96) by the remaining number of people (12), which resulted in Rs. 8 per person. However, this did not account for the extra Rs. 4 each person had to contribute.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Reasoning:** \n1. Let x be the original number of friends who planned to attend the picnic.\n2. The total cost of the eatables was Rs. 96, so each person would initially contribute Rs. 96/x.\n3. After four people didn't show up, the remaining number of people became (x-4).\n4. Each of the remaining people had to contribute an extra Rs. 4, so their total contribution became Rs. (96/x) + 4.\n5. The total cost of the eatables remained the same at Rs. 96.\n6. Setting up the equation: 96 = (x-4) * [(96/x) + 4]\n7. Solving the equation: \n    - Multiply both sides by x: 96x = (x-4) * (96 + 4x)\n    - Expand the right side: 96x = 96x + 4x^2 - 384 - 16x\n    - Simplify: 4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0\n    - Divide both sides by 4: x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0\n    - Factor the equation: (x-12)(x+8) = 0\n    - Solve for x: x = 12 or x = -8 (Discard the negative solution)\n8. Therefore, the original number of friends who planned to attend the picnic was 12.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\") \n"
