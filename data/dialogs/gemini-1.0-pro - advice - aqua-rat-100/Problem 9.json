I divided the total profit ($3,000) by the profit margin (25%) without considering the selling price ($100). This resulted in an inflated number of bags sold (24).\n**Correct Approach:**\n1. **Calculate the profit margin per bag:** 25% of $100 = $25\n2. **Divide the total profit by the profit margin per bag:** $3,000 รท $25 = 120 bags\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\") \n"
