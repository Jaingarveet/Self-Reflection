I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Thought:**\n* The percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20 = 5%.\n* This percentage represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag.\n* Let Q be the total number of marbles in the bag.\n* The number of black marbles in the bag is 0.05Q.\n* Since 20 black marbles were added to the bag, the total number of black marbles is 0.05Q + 20.\n* The total number of marbles in the bag is Q + 20.\n* We know that 0.05Q + 20 = 0.05(Q + 20).\n* Solving for Q, we get Q = 380.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")"
