I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-Reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the total percentage of vitamins E and A provided by one gram of the health food (17%). However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the minimum daily requirement for each vitamin.\n* **Correction:** To solve this problem, we need to find the number of grams that provide at least 100% of the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins E and A.\n**Solution:**\nLet x be the number of grams of the health food needed daily.\nFor vitamin E: 0.09x >= 1 (100% of the minimum daily requirement)\nFor vitamin A: 0.08x >= 1 (100% of the minimum daily requirement)\nSolving for x in both equations:\nVitamin E: x >= 1 / 0.09 = 11.11\nVitamin A: x >= 1 / 0.08 = 12.5\nTherefore, to meet the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins, at least 12.5 grams of the health food must be eaten daily.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
