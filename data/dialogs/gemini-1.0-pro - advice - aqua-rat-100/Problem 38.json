        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: 500\n**Reasoning for Previous Answer:**\n1. I calculated the total number of small cubes in the hollow cube: (5-2)^3 = 27.\n2. I then calculated the surface area of the hollow cube: 6 * (5^2 - (5-2)^2) = 90.\n3. Assuming each small cube has 6 faces, I multiplied the surface area by the number of small cubes: 90 * 27 = 2430.\n4. I then subtracted the number of faces on the outer surface (90) to get the number of unpainted faces: 2430 - 90 = 2340.\n5. However, I realized that this approach counted the inner faces of the hollow cube as unpainted, which is incorrect.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. The number of small cubes on each face of the hollow cube is (5-2)^2 = 9.\n2. The total number of faces on the small cubes is 6 * 9 = 54.\n3. The number of faces on the outer surface of the hollow cube is 6.\n4. Therefore, the number of unpainted faces is 54 - 6 = 48.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
