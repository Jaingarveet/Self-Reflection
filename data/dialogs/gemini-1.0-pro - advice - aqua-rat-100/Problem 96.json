I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the ratio of investments incorrectly, leading to an incorrect answer.\n* **Correction:** I will carefully calculate the ratio of investments based on the time each person invested their money.\n* **Improvement:** I will double-check my calculations and ensure I am using the correct formula for calculating ratios.\n**Solution:**\nLet's calculate the ratio of investments:\n* A: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000 (invested for 12 months)\n* B: 60,000 * 10 = 600,000 (invested for 10 months)\n* C: 120,000 * x (invested for x months)\nThe total investment ratio is 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000x.\nSince C received Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, his share is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.\nTherefore, the ratio of investments for C should also be 2/5.\n2/5 = 120,000x / (480,000 + 600,000)\n2/5 = 120,000x / 1,080,000\nx = (2/5) * 1,080,000 / 120,000\nx = 3.6\nC joined the business after 3.6 months, which is approximately 4 months.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")**"
