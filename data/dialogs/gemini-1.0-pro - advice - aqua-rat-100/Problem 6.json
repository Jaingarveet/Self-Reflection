I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially calculated the total work incorrectly, leading to an incorrect answer.\n* **Reasoning:** I did not consider the different rates of each worker and the time they spent working.\n* **Correction:** I will carefully calculate the work done by each worker and the remaining work to be completed by Mr. Blue.\n**Solution:**\n* Mr. Brown paints 1/6 of a house per day.\n* Mr. Black paints 1/8 of a house per day.\n* Mr. Blue paints 1/12 of a house per day.\n* In 8 days, Mr. Brown paints 8/6 = 4/3 houses.\n* In 6 days, Mr. Black paints 6/8 = 3/4 houses.\n* The total work completed is 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 houses.\n* The remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = 1/12 houses.\n* Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in 1 day.\n* Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue **1 day** to complete the contract.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")**"
