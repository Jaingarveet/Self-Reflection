I assumed that B was the midpoint of minor arc AC, which was not stated in the question. As a result, I calculated the measure of minor arc AD incorrectly.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read the question and understand the problem before attempting to solve it. I will also decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step. I will not skip any steps and will be explicit in each step of my reasoning. I will double-check my calculations and final answer. Finally, I will remember that the measure of a minor arc is always positive, even if the result of my initial calculation is negative.\nThought:\nSince B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AB is half the measure of minor arc AC, which is 160°/2 = 80°.\nThe measure of minor arc AD is the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB and BD, which is 80° + 150° = 230°.\nHowever, the measure of a minor arc cannot be greater than 180°, so the measure of minor arc AD is 230° - 180° = 50°.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
