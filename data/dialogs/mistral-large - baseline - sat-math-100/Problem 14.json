This means that the equation of the line must be in the form $y=mx$.\n\nWhen $x=3a$, $y=-a$, so we can substitute these values into the equation to find the slope: $-a=m(3a)$, which simplifies to $m=-1/3$.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $y=-1/3x$.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to $x+3y=0$.\n\nComparing this to the answer choices, we can see that none of them match exactly. However, we can manipulate the equation to match one of the choices.\n\nIf we multiply both sides of our equation by 2, we get $2x+6y=0$.\n\nWe can then subtract $4ay$ from both sides to get $2x+2y=-4ay$.\n\nFinally, we can add $5ay$ to both sides to get $2x+2y=ay$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
