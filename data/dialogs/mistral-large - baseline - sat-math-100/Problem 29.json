We know the weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons, so we can find its mass by rearranging the formula to $m=\\frac{W}{g}$. Using the value of $g$ for Earth from the chart, we get $m=\\frac{150}{9.8} \\approx 15.3$ kg.\nNow we can use this mass to find the weight of the object on each of the planets listed in the choices. We'll use the values of $g$ from the chart and the formula $W=m g$ to calculate the weight on each planet.\n\n* Venus: $W=15.3 \\times 8.9 \\approx 136$ newtons\n* Saturn: $W=15.3 \\times 11.1 \\approx 170$ newtons\n* Uranus: $W=15.3 \\times 10.7 \\approx 164$ newtons\n* Neptune: $W=15.3 \\times 14.1 \\approx 216$ newtons\n\nThe weight of the object on Saturn is approximately 170 newtons.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
