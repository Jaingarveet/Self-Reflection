The original area of the rectangle is L \\* W.\nAfter the alterations, the length becomes 1.1L and the width becomes (1 - p/100)W. The new area is 1.1L \\* (1 - p/100)W.\nAccording to the question, the new area is 88% of the original area. So we have:\n1.1L \\* (1 - p/100)W = 0.88L \\* W\n\nDividing both sides by L \\* W, we get:\n1.1 \\* (1 - p/100) = 0.88\n\nNow, we can solve for p:\n1.1 - 1.1p/100 = 0.88\n1.1p/100 = 1.1 - 0.88\n1.1p/100 = 0.22\np = 0.22 \\* 100 / 1.1\np â‰ˆ 20\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
