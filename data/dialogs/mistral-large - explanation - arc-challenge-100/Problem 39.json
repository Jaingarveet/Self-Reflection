As the protostar contracts, its core temperature increases until nuclear fusion can occur, at which point it becomes a main sequence star.\nChoice A is incorrect because hydrogen in the cores of stars is exhausted during the later stages of a star's life, not during its formation.\nChoice B is incorrect because while material from dead stars can contribute to the formation of new stars, it is not the primary process involved in star formation.\nChoice C is incorrect because elements such as iron do not undergo fusion in stars; fusion in stars is limited to lighter elements such as hydrogen and helium.\nChoice D is incorrect because while the cores of stars do become more massive as they evolve, this is not a process associated with star formation.\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\") (Note: The correct answer has been redacted in the self-reflection, so I cannot provide it here.)"
