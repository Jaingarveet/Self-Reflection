Let x be the number of students in the class.\n\nWhen Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This can be represented as:\n\n3x + 5 = n\n\nWhen Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional 21 milliliters. This can be represented as:\n\n4x = n + 21\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n4x - 3x = 21 + 5\n\nx = 26\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I made an algebraic error when setting up the equations. I incorrectly subtracted the first equation from the second equation, which resulted in an incorrect answer. To avoid this error in the future, I will carefully check my equation setup and simplification steps."
