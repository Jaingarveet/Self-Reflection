From clue (3), we know that the administrative department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department. Therefore, the administrative department must be on the floor immediately above the planning department, and the human resources department must be on one of the two floors above the administrative department. From clue (1), we know that the sales department is not on one of the two floors adjacent to the human resources department, so it must be on one of the two floors above the human resources department. Finally, the research and development department must be on the remaining floor.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - Finance Department, Planning Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department, Sales Department, R & D Department"
