Any car equipped with airbags may experience a car accident.\n  B: Ignore this possibility? Owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously.\n  C: Improper assumption?

The evidence used to support the conclusion is that statistics show that in car accidents, the proportion of cars with airbags is higher than that of cars without airbags.\n3. The assumption made in the argument is that the severity of the car owner's injury in an accident is the only factor that determines whether the car owner is safer.\n4. Answer choice A assumes that all cars, regardless of whether they have airbags or not, may experience a car accident. This assumption does not point out the loophole in the argument. Answer choice B assumes that owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously, which is irrelevant to the argument. Answer choice C assumes that the airbag will always open in any car accident, which is not necessarily true. Answer choice D correctly points out that the argument improperly equates the possibility of a car accident with the seriousness of the car owner's injury in the accident.\n5. Action: Answer(\"D\")"
