Read and analyze each option carefully.\n2. Identify the option that supports the argument in the question stem.\n3. Eliminate options that are not relevant to the argument or weaken it.\n4. Choose the option that best supports the argument.\n"

It also mentions that we can evaluate prescribed right and wrong. The question asks which option supports the argument. \nOption A talks about how we need regulations to judge right and wrong, which supports the argument. \nOption B talks about punishment from heaven, which is not relevant to the argument. \nOption C talks about how rules and standards are behind the judgment of right and wrong, which supports the argument. \nOption D talks about how moral regulations vary from person to person and place to place, which weakens the argument. \nTherefore, the answer is Action: Answer(\"A\")."
