        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Understand the given information:\n   * Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week\n   * His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon\n   * Gasoline costs $4 per gallon\n   * Alan wants to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure by $5\n2. Define the variable:\n   * Let $m$ be the number of miles Alan should drive less each week\n3. Set up the equation:\n   * Current cost of gasoline per week = $\\frac{100 \\text{ miles}}{25 \\text{ miles/gallon}} \\times \\$4/\\text{gallon} = \\$16$\n   * Desired cost of gasoline per week = Current cost - $5 = $16 - $5 = $11\n   * Desired miles driven per week = 100 miles - $m$ miles\n   * Equation: $\\frac{100-m}{25} \\times 4 = 11$\n4. Solve the equation:\n   * $\\frac{100-m}{25} \\times 4 = 11$\n   * $\\frac{4}{25}(100-m) = 11$\n   * $\\frac{4}{25}(100-m) = \\frac{4}{25} \\times 25$\n   * $100-m = 25$\n   * $-m = 25-100$\n   * $-m = -75$\n   * $m = 75$\n5. Check the answer choices:\n   * The equation $\\frac{4}{25}m = 5$ matches our setup and solution\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: $\\frac{4}{25}m = 5$\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
