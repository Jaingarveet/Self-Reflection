So $a=9$, $m=3$, and $n=4$.\n3) Applying the rule, we get:\n   $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (\\sqrt[4]{9})^3 = (9^{\\frac{1}{4}})^3$\n4) Now, let's look at the answer choices:\n   A: $\\sqrt[3]{9}$ is equivalent to $9^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, not $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\n   B: $\\sqrt[4]{9}$ is equivalent to $9^{\\frac{1}{4}}$, which is part of the correct expansion of $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$, but not the complete answer.\n   C: $\\sqrt{3}$ is not related to the given expression.\n   D: $3\\sqrt{3}$ is also not related to the given expression.\n5) None of the given answer choices correctly represent $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nTherefore, none of the provided choices are equivalent to $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
