Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

[step] If you have a low sex drive, or if your sex drive has declined with age, you might want to give it a boost with some extra testosterone. In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.\nChoices:\n  A: A healthy body needs more testosterone in order to maintain erections. Some women who are female or older do not maintain regular erections until all their testosterone has been expended, so other people may need testosterone anyway.\n  B: [substeps] Be honest with yourself if you want to lower your testosterone. Taking testosterone supplements can lead to a reduction in your sex drive.\n  C: [title] Distinguish between testosterone and regular erections. [step] Studies have shown that women with low testosterone are able to have slightly lower levels of sexual function after sex, which is because the hormone changes are carried out through pleasure.\n  D: [title] Ask yourself if you want a healthier body. [step] Men who suffer from low testosterone may experience increased body fat and larger breasts.\n\nThought:\nThe text discusses the benefits of testosterone for sexual function, specifically for men. \nOption B seems to be the most logical continuation as it introduces the potential downsides of taking testosterone, providing a balanced perspective.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
