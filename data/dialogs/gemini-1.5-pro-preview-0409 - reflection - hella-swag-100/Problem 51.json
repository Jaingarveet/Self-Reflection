Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Hurling Question\n**Explanation:** I focused too much on the specific actions described (throwing and hitting a ball) and assumed the passage was describing a continuous action sequence within a game. I failed to consider the broader context of team sports and the purpose of drills, which is typically followed by discussion or further instruction.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Contextual misunderstanding\n*   Assumption of continuous action\n*   Neglecting purpose of drills\n**Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze the situation:** Boys are practicing throwing and hitting a ball in a specific pattern. This suggests a sports practice setting with drills.\n2.  **Consider the purpose of drills:** Drills are typically used to improve skills and teamwork, followed by feedback, discussion, or instruction.\n3.  **Evaluate options:**\n    *   Option A describes a complex game scenario, unlikely to immediately follow a drill.\n    *   Option B is unrelated to sports and involves batons and a stage.\n    *   Option C suggests the end of an event, not a transition within a practice.\n    *   **Option D aligns with the purpose of drills, with the team forming a huddle for discussion or instruction.**\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Consider the broader context** beyond the specific actions described.\n2.  **Identify the purpose or goal** of the activity (e.g., practice, game, performance).\n3.  **Think about typical sequences of events** in the given context (e.g., drills followed by discussion in sports practice).\n4.  **Evaluate options based on logical transitions and coherence** with the context and purpose.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Avoid focusing solely on keywords or specific actions.**\n*   **Think about the overall situation, goals, and common sequences of events.**\n*   **Consider the purpose and motivations of the people involved.**\n*   **Use common sense and real-world knowledge to infer likely outcomes.** \n"
