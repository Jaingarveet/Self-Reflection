        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In some countries, there is a free flow of information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, whereas in other countries, this information is controlled by a small elite. In the latter countries, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare. Thus, these countries are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries do.\nQuestion: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: It is more likely that people without political power will suffer from economic crises than it is that people in power will.\n  B: Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases.\n  C: In nations in which the government controls access to information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, economic crises are common.\n  D: The higher the percentage of the population that participates in economic decisions, the better those decisions are.\n  E: A small elite that controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is likely to manipulate that information for its own benefit.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe conclusion that the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare, and that this lack of information leads to more frequent economic crises, logically follows from the assumption that economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases (choice B).\n\nThe other answer choices do not logically lead to the conclusion. Choice A states that people without political power are more likely to suffer from economic crises, but this does not necessarily relate to the availability of information. Choice C mentions that economic crises are common in nations where the government controls access to information, but this does not imply a causal relationship between the two. Choice D suggests that higher participation in economic decisions leads to better decisions, but this is unrelated to the availability of information. Choice E suggests that the elite may manipulate information for their own benefit, but this does not necessarily result in economic crises.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice B.\n"
