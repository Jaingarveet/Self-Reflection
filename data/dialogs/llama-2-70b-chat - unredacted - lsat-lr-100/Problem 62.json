Children need to learn the consequences of being bad. Yoko: Children's stories still tend to have clearly immoral characters in them, but now these characters tend not to be the sort that frighten children. Surely that's an improvement.\nQuestion: Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories\nChoices:\n  A: should be less frightening than they are\n  B: tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were\n  C: differ significantly in overall quality from earlier children's stories\n  D: tend to have clearly immoral characters in them\n  E: should help children learn the consequences of being bad\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the nuance of the disagreement between Peter and Yoko.

Yoko, on the other hand, believes that children's stories still have immoral characters, but they are not as frightening as they used to be, which is an improvement.\n\nThe correct answer is D, as Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories tend to have clearly immoral characters in them.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Carefully read the question and the disagreement between Peter and Yoko.\n2. Identify the main issue that Peter and Yoko are disagreeing on.\n3. Look for the choice that best aligns with the main issue.\n4.
