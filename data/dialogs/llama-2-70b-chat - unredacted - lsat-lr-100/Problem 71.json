Additionally, the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. This means that all the works displayed in the museum that are not on loan from private collectors are part of the museum's permanent collection, and therefore, there are prints of them in the museum store.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true based on the given information:\n\nOption A: This statement is not necessarily true, as there may be works on loan to the museum that are not in the museum's permanent collection, and therefore, there may not be prints of them in the museum store.\n\nOption B: This statement is not necessarily true, as the museum store may sell prints of works that are not twentieth-century works.\n\nOption D: This statement is false, as Hopper's Nighthawks is not on loan to the museum from a private collector, but rather is a print that is sold in the museum store.\n\nOption E: This statement is false, as Hopper's Nighthawks is indeed displayed in the museum, but its print is sold in the museum store.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n"
