        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.\n  B: Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.\n  C: Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations.\n  D: A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\n  E: A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAction: Answer(E)\n\nExplanation:\nThe editorial argues that the current school calendar, which was established to accommodate agricultural life, is no longer relevant and should be changed to better serve the interests of children. The assumption on which the editorial's argument depends is that a school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would be more beneficial for children than the current calendar with long breaks. Choice E, \"A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks,\" accurately reflects this assumption.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect format\n - Failure to identify the correct assumption\n\nSolution:\nIdentify the assumption on which the editorial's argument depends.\nRestate the assumption in your own words.\nChoose the answer choice that most accurately reflects the restated assumption.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the editorial and understand the argument being made.\n2. Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.\n3. Restate the assumption in your own words.\n4. Choose the answer choice that most accurately reflects the restated assumption.\n5. Verify that the chosen answer choice logically follows from the restated assumption.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the editorial carefully and understand the argument being made.\n - Identify the underlying assumptions that support the argument.\n - Restate the assumptions in your own words to ensure clarity.\n - Choose the answer choice that most accurately reflects the restated assumption.\n - Verify that the chosen answer choice logically follows from the restated assumption.\n - Pay attention to the format of your answer and ensure it is correct.\n"
