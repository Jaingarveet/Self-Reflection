        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Anyone who knows Ellsworth knows that he is bursting with self-righteousness, touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation. So no one who knows him will be surprised that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.\n  B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before.\n  C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.\n  D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.\n  E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAction: Answer(E)\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. The passage states that Ellsworth is self-righteous and offended by suggestions of unethical business practices. It is reasonable to assume that people who know Ellsworth expect him to be easily offended, given his self-righteous nature. This expectation does not necessarily imply that Ellsworth is engaged in unethical practices, but it does suggest that his offense may be a result of his self-righteousness rather than any actual wrongdoing.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Assumption\n* Hypocrisy\n* Indignation\n* Offense\n* Self-righteousness\n\nSolution:\n1. Identify the self-righteous person in the passage.\n2. Identify the reason for the person's offense.\n3. Consider the possibility that the person's offense may be a cover for unethical behavior.\n4. Assess whether the person's self-righteousness is the cause of their offense.\n5. Evaluate whether people who know the person expect them to be easily offended.\n6. Choose the answer that aligns with the evaluation.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully.\n2. Identify the key characters and their traits.\n3. Analyze the relationships between the characters and their traits.\n4. Evaluate the assumptions made in the passage.\n5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the information provided.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the passage carefully and identify the key characters and their traits.\n* Analyze the relationships between the characters and their traits.\n* Evaluate the assumptions made in the passage.\n* Choose the answer that logically follows from the information provided.\n* Avoid making assumptions that are not supported by the passage.\n"
