        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the connection between the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and international film festivals, neglecting the broader context of Canadian films as a whole. This led me to a conclusion that was not necessarily supported by the given statements.\n## Reasoning for Correct Answer:\n1. **Statement Analysis:** We know that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and that most prize-winning films from this festival also won prizes internationally.\n2. **Focus on Overlap:** The key is to identify the overlap between films winning at Lac Nichoutec and those winning internationally. \n3. **Choice C directly addresses this overlap:** It states that \"Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\" This is a direct consequence of the given information, as some of the Lac Nichoutec winners (which are all Canadian films) also won at international festivals.\n## Eliminating Other Choices:\n* **Choice A:** This reverses the direction of the connection. We know Lac Nichoutec winners succeeded internationally, but not necessarily the reverse.\n* **Choice B:** We have no information about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec compared to all Canadian films produced.\n* **Choice D:** This might be true, but it's not guaranteed by the statements. \n* **Choice E:** This also might be true, but it's not a necessary conclusion from the given information.\nTherefore, based on the given information and focusing on the overlap between the two groups of films, the only guaranteed true statement is that some internationally awarded films were Canadian.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
