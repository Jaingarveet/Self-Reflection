Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely focused on the variability of allergens between cats and the fact that not all cats trigger reactions in all individuals. This led me to incorrectly choose an answer that emphasized the unpredictable nature of allergic reactions.  However, the passage clearly states that the specific proteins causing allergies vary between individuals, not cats.\n## Applying the Learning:\nThe key takeaway is to focus on the cause of the allergy (proteins) and its variability among **individuals**, not cats.\n## Answering the Question:\n**Analysis:**\n*   Option A is incorrect as it suggests breed-specific allergies, which is not supported by the text.\n*   Option B is closer, but it talks about \"all types of allergy sufferers,\" which is too broad. The passage focuses on cat allergies specifically.\n*   **Option C directly addresses the variability of proteins between individual cats, aligning with the passage's main point.**\n*   Option D discusses the intensity of reactions, which is not mentioned in the passage.\n*   Option E, while related to unpredictability, is not the central point of the passage.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
