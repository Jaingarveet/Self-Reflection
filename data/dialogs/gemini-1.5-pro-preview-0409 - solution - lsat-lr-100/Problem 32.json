On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

However, the core of the editorial's argument lies in the perceived inconsistency of the political party's stance on education spending, not the morality of the goal itself.\n**Understanding the Argument:**\nThe editorial criticizes the party for claiming both that increased education spending is a worthy goal and that the government should not increase such spending. This implies an inconsistency in their policy. \n**Key Assumption:**\nThe argument hinges on the assumption that it's inconsistent for a party to hold both these views simultaneously.  \n**Corrected Approach:**\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer should point to the inconsistency of holding both positions. \n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
