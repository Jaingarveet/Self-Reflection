The curator mentions the store sells prints of works NOT in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.\n* **B:** This MUST be true. The curator states the museum ONLY displays 20th-century works, and the store sells prints of displayed works and some additional ones like Nighthawks (also 20th century).\n* **C:** This may not be true. The curator only mentions prints of works in the permanent collection are available, not necessarily ALL displayed works.\n* **D:** This may not be true. We only know Nighthawks is NOT part of the permanent collection, but its loan status is unclear.\n* **E:** This may not be true. The information about Nighthawks doesn't clarify if it's displayed or not.\nTherefore, the only option that MUST be true is B. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
