Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

The argument focuses specifically on the controllability of the feeling of love in the context of vows.\n* **B:** This aligns with the implied premise 2, making it a strong contender. \n* **C:** While true, it doesn't explain why \"love\" *shouldn't* be interpreted as feelings.\n* **D:** This restates the implied premise 2, making it equivalent to option B.\n* **E:** This is too strong. The argument focuses on promises making sense, not necessarily on their ability to be kept perfectly.\n## Conclusion:\nBoth **B and D** represent the implied premise necessary for the ethicist's conclusion to be valid. Since the options are essentially equivalent, choosing either would be correct. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
