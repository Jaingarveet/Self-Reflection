However, I can still analyze the current conversation and provide the best possible answer based on the information available.\n## Analysis of Peter and Yoko's Disagreement:\n* **Peter:** Believes modern children's stories lack clearly immoral characters and thinks this is negative. He argues children need to learn consequences of bad behavior.\n* **Yoko:** Agrees that modern stories still have immoral characters but argues they are less frightening, which she sees as an improvement.\n## Identifying the Point of Disagreement:\nBased on their statements, Peter and Yoko disagree on the **nature of immoral characters** in today's children's stories compared to earlier ones. \nTherefore, the best answer is: \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
