The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

However, I can still analyze the question and choices to determine the least helpful factor in establishing the conclusion's validity.\n## Analysis:\nThe conclusion states that at least one type of memory doesn't decline with age, based on Group A's superior performance in remembering to make a call at a specific time. We need to identify the option that least strengthens this cause-and-effect relationship.\n* **A, D, and E** ensure both groups had equal opportunity and resources to perform the task, making the comparison fair.\n* **B** ensures consistency in answering the calls, eliminating potential bias in recording the call times.\n* **C** simply clarifies the age range of Group B but doesn't directly impact the comparison between the groups' memory performance.\n## Conclusion:\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")**\nOption C is the least helpful as it only provides additional information about Group B's age range without affecting the validity of the comparison between the groups' memory capabilities. \n"
