I realized that the text does not mention a bowl, and the action of stirring suggests that the person is adding more ingredients to a glass, rather than mixing a drink in a bowl. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) pulls out more stuff from the bag and swirls it around in the glass and adds it to the glass.\n\n[REDACTED]"
