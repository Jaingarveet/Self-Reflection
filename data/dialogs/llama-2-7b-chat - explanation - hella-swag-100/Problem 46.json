The correct answer is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. This is because the text states that the man rakes the mulch out over the ground, indicating that he is adding more mulch to the lawn, not removing dirt or blowing it around.\n\nIn my previous answer, I misunderstood the context of the situation and selected (A) rakes up dirt over the mulch. This was incorrect because the text does not mention anything about raking up dirt, and the man is actually adding mulch to the lawn.\n\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read the text and consider the context of the situation before answering the question."
