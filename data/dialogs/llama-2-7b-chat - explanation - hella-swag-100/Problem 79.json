However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option C: is shown with a river flowing.\n\nMy mistake was due to misinterpreting the context of the sentence. I thought the closing image was likely to be a photograph of the dog after the bath, but the text suggests that the image is a representation of the dog being washed in a river.\n\nTo avoid making the same mistake in the future, I will carefully read and interpret the question, paying close attention to the context and details provided."
