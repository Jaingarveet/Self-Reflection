That leaves G, H, I, W, X, Y for the other departments.\n2. H and Y must be together (given). So they are either both in production, both in sales, or both in PR. \n3. If X is in sales, then W must be in production (given). The contrapositive is also true: if W is not in production, then X cannot be in sales.\n4. F and G cannot be together (given). Since F is in production, G must be in either sales or PR.\n5. There must be 3 people in production, 3 in sales, and 1 in PR (given).\n6. If G is in sales, then H and Y cannot be in sales (since there are only 3 sales spots and G would take one). \n7. If H and Y are not in sales, they must be together in either production or PR.\n8. But production already has F, so adding both H and Y would exceed the 3 person limit. Therefore, H and Y cannot be in production.\n9. The only remaining option is for H and Y to be in PR together. This forces G to be in sales.\nTherefore, G and Y cannot be in sales together, since Y must be in PR with H.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
