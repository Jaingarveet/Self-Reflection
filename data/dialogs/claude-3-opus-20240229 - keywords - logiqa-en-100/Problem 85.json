This eliminates choice A.\nFrom condition (2), papers G and H cannot both be used, as that would require paper J to not be used. This eliminates choice B.\nCondition (3) states that if G is not used, then K is not needed. However, the converse is not necessarily true - if K is not used, G could still potentially be used. So choice C is not definitively true.\nLooking at choice D: \n- We don't know for certain that G is unnecessary. \n- However, if J is used, then from condition (2) we know that neither G nor H can be used.\n- And if J is not used, G and H could potentially be used, but are not required to be.\nSo in either case, G is not strictly necessary. The same logic applies to J.\nTherefore, choice D must be true - it is possible to not use either paper G or paper J.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
