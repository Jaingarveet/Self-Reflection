H and Y must be in the same department (given condition 1). \n   Since F is in production, and F and G can't be in the same department (condition 2),\n   G can't be in production. So H and Y can't be in production either, as that would\n   force G to be with them.\n3. If X is in sales, then W must be in production (given condition 3).\n   But we know from step 2 that H and Y must also be together in a non-production department.\n   The only way to satisfy this is to put X in public relations, W in production, and\n   H and Y in sales together.\n4. That leaves I and G. We know G can't be in production with F. So G must go to sales\n   with H and Y, and I goes to production with F and W.\nTherefore, the final allocation is:\nPublic Relations: X\nProduction: F, I, W  \nSales: G, H, Y\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
