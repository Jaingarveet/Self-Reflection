        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe expert's main argument is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to allow giant ships to pass through and fully utilize the Yangtze River waterway.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA) This supports the expert's view by highlighting the negative economic impact of the bridge limiting ship passage. It does not raise doubts.\nB) This suggests that 99% of international ships don't even go past the Nanjing Bridge, and the ports above it rarely have large ships. If true, this would mean demolishing the bridge to allow large ship passage is not actually necessary, contradicting the expert. \nC) This just says there are other low bridges that also limit ships. It doesn't contradict the need to address the Nanjing Bridge specifically.\nD) 8000-ton ships being able to pass through to Wuhan suggests the bridge is not actually preventing large ships as the expert claims. However, those ships are specially designed for the Yangtze, so it doesn't fully refute the expert's broader point about giant ships in general.\nConsidering the reflection keywords, B provides the strongest contradictory evidence to the expert's central claim, while the other choices are either supportive or focus on less relevant details. Avoiding confirmation bias, B raises the most doubt.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
