        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know F must be in production (given condition 4). \n2. If X is in the same department as F, then X must also be in production.\n3. If X is in production, then W must also be in production (given condition 3).\n4. So if X and F are in the same department (production), then F, X and W are all in production. That fills the 3 production slots.\n5. H and Y must be together (condition 1), so they must be either in sales or public relations. \n6. Since there's only 1 public relations slot, H and Y must be in sales together.\n7. That leaves G and I. G can't be with F (condition 2), and F is in production, so G must be in sales or public relations.\n8. I must then take the remaining slot, either sales or public relations, whichever G did not take.\nTherefore, if X and F are in the same department (production), the only possible allocations are:\nProduction: F, X, W\nSales: H, Y, and either G or I \nPublic Relations: either G or I\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: G in sales is possible, so this can be true.\nB: H must be in sales, so this cannot be true.\nC: I in sales is possible, so this can be true. \nD: W must be in production, so this cannot be true.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
