The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department (given). \n3. The human resources department and sales department cannot be on adjacent floors (given).\n4. If the finance department is directly above planning (1), and administration is above planning but below HR (2), then the order so far must be:\n   Planning\n   Finance \n   Administration\n   Human Resources\n5. The sales department can't be directly above or below HR (3). The only spot left for sales is the very top. \n6. That leaves R&D to go between HR and Sales.\nSo the final order from bottom to top is:\nPlanning Department \nFinance Department\nAdministration Department \nHuman Resources Department\nR&D Department\nSales Department\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
