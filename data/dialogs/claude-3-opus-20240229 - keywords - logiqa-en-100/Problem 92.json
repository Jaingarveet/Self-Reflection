We have three statements from the professors:\n   - Prof Zhao: The champion is not Tsinghua or Zhejiang \n   - Prof Qian: The champion is not Tsinghua, but is USTC\n   - Prof Sun: The champion is not USTC, but is Tsinghua\n2. We're told that only one professor is completely correct, one is completely wrong, and one is half right.\n3. If Prof Zhao is completely correct, that would mean Tsinghua and Zhejiang both didn't win. But this conflicts with the other two statements, so Prof Zhao can't be completely correct.\n4. If Prof Qian is completely correct, that would mean USTC won. But this conflicts with Prof Sun's statement. So Prof Qian can't be completely correct either.\n5. If Prof Sun is completely correct, that would mean Tsinghua won. This is consistent with Prof Zhao being half right (Tsinghua didn't win, Zhejiang didn't win). And it's consistent with Prof Qian being completely wrong.\n6. Therefore, the only possibility is that Prof Sun is completely correct, Prof Zhao is half right, and Prof Qian is completely wrong. This means Tsinghua University won.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
