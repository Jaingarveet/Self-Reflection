        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The first statement says that for listed companies, only those with dividends can issue new stocks. \n2. The second statement says that if a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.\n3. The third statement says that if a company needs financing, there is no way for it to pay dividends.\nFrom these statements, we can deduce:\n- If a listed company needs financing, it cannot have dividends (from statement 3)\n- If a listed company does not have dividends, it cannot issue new stocks (contrapositive of statement 1)\n- Therefore, if a listed company needs financing, it cannot issue new stocks.\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\nA: This is the contrapositive of statement 2. It must be true if statement 2 is true.\nB: This does not have to be true. A listed company could not need financing and also not have dividends.\nC: This must be true. If a listed company does not need to issue new stocks, then either it does not need financing (and so can have dividends), or it needs financing but has no dividends (and so cannot issue new stocks).\nD: This is false, because as deduced above, a listed company that needs financing cannot issue new stocks.\nTherefore, the answer that cannot be false is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
