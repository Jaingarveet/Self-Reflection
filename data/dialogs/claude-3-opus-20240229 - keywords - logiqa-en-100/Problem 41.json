It also states that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can actually achieve a 20% productivity increase.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) This is not necessarily true. The question only states that a 10% increase is needed to avoid bankruptcy. It does not say a 20% increase is required.\nB) This logically follows from the information given. If a 10% increase avoids bankruptcy, and Green Island can actually achieve a 20% increase, then a 20% increase will certainly avoid bankruptcy.\nC) The question does not provide any information about what happens if the market does not change. We cannot deduce this statement from the given information.\nD) This directly contradicts the information given, which states that if a 10% increase is possible, then a 20% increase is achievable.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true based on the information provided is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
