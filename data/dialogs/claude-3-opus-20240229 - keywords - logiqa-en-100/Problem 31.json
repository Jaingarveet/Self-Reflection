It claims they are inevitable.\nTo question this opinion, we need to find evidence that the storms are not inevitable natural disasters, but rather caused by human factors.\nChoice A: The fact that grass used to be much taller in the 1950s compared to now suggests that the degradation is not purely due to natural climate change, but likely influenced by human activity over time. This choice helps question the given opinion.\nChoice B: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia versus the much healthier grasslands in neighboring Mongolia also points to human influence, since the regions likely experience similar natural climate conditions. This choice helps question the opinion too.\nChoice C: The fact that grass along the uninhabited border maintains its 1950s height strongly suggests that the degradation elsewhere is due to human factors, not inevitable natural changes. This choice questions the opinion.\nChoice D: This choice directly states that human factors like overgrazing are the main cause of increased dust storms. It does not help to question the opinion, but rather directly refutes it.\nTherefore, Choice D is the only one that does not help question the given opinion, since it outright states the opinion is incorrect rather than simply casting doubt on it.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
