Z (this basket of vegetables) does not have property Y (is not cheap) \n   3. Therefore, Z is not X (not from Dongdun Market)\nC) This also does not match. It goes:\n   1. All X (Jiutian employees) have Y (speak English)\n   2. Z (Lin Yingrui) is X \n   3. Therefore Z has Y\n   This is a valid argument but a different structure.\nD) This also has a different structure:\n   1. All X (those meeting conditions) can do Y (apply for loan)\n   2. Z (Sun Wen) did not do Y\n   3. Therefore Z is not X  \n   This reverses the order of the original.\nTherefore, B is the only choice that matches the logical structure of the original argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
