This fits with the expert view but doesn't address the survey finding.\nB) If cities with strict enforcement still have drunk driving occurring, that could explain why their accident rates are similar to cities without enforcement. The enforcement may not be effective enough.\nC) Driver awareness is a separate issue. Even if awareness is more important, it doesn't resolve the specific inconsistency about enforcement.\nD) Stopping other violations is also a tangential point. The inconsistency is specifically about drunk driving enforcement.\nTherefore, B provides the most direct explanation - if drunk driving is still prevalent despite enforcement, accident rates may remain high. The enforcement might be insufficient to significantly reduce drunk driving and accidents.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
