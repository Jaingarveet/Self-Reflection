Eliminated.\nChoice B questions how we can know others have similar experiences. This challenges the argument's assumption and is a reasonable doubt. Eliminated. \nChoice C claims mirages are real because visual experience is reliable. However, the argument never claimed all visual experiences are veridical - just that they generally indicate an external reality. Mirages being illusions is compatible with the argument. This is not a strong objection.\nChoice D asks why natural science is so successful if it's not reflecting an external reality. This actually supports the original argument rather than challenging it. The success of science is presented as evidence for an external world.\nTherefore, choice C is the only option that does not present a reasonable challenge or rebuttal to the argument for an external world.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
