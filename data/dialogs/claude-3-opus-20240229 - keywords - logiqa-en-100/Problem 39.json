So Robot 1 must be Type A.\n2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize shape (balls) but not color. So Robot 2 must be Type B.\n3. We can rule out choices A and B, because neither robot behaved like a Type C that can't recognize color or shape.\n4. Choice C matches our deductions - Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B. \n5. Choice D is incorrect, because we determined Robot 1 is Type A (not \"not Type B\") and Robot 2 is Type B (not \"not Type A\").\nTherefore, the answer that must be true is C - Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
