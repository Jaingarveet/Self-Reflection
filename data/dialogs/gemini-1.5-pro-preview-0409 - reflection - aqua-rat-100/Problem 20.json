Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the final ratio requirement. I focused on increasing the proportion of girls to match the boys' proportion, rather than adjusting both to reach the desired 4:3 ratio.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Ratio misinterpretation\n*   Proportion misunderstanding\n*   Goal misalignment \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Initial Ratio:** The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64/40, which simplifies to 8/5.\n2.  **Target Ratio:** We want a final ratio of 4/3. \n3.  **Equivalent Ratios:** To compare, we need equivalent ratios with the same \"parts\". Multiplying both parts of the target ratio by 2, we get 8/6.\n4.  **Difference in Parts:** The difference in \"girl parts\" between the initial ratio (5 parts) and the desired ratio (6 parts) is 1 part.\n5.  **Value of One Part:** Initially, 5 parts correspond to 40 girls, so 1 part represents 40 girls / 5 parts = 8 girls.\n6.  **Number to Add:** To achieve the 8/6 ratio, we need to add 1 part to both boys and girls, which means adding 8 boys and 8 girls.\n7.  **Final Number of Members:** The group will have 64 (boys) + 8 (boys) + 40 (girls) + 8 (girls) = 120 members. \n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  Always simplify the initial and target ratios to their lowest terms.\n2.  Find equivalent ratios with the same \"parts\" to enable direct comparison.\n3.  Identify the difference in \"parts\" between the initial and target ratios for both boys and girls.\n4.  Calculate the value of one \"part\" based on the initial number of boys or girls.\n5.  Multiply the value of one \"part\" by the difference in \"parts\" to find the number of boys and girls to add.\n6.  Add the calculated number of boys and girls to the initial number to find the final total.\n7.  Double-check your calculations and ensure the final ratio matches the target ratio.\n**General Advice:**\n*   Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and the specific requirements of the target ratio.\n*   Focus on adjusting both parts of the ratio proportionally to achieve the desired outcome.\n*   Use equivalent ratios to facilitate comparison and avoid misinterpretations.\n*   Break down the problem into smaller steps and work through them systematically.\n*   Always verify your solution against the problem statement and the target ratio. \n"
