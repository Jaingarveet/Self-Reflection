Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I focused on the net progress per day and the total distance but neglected the specific action on the day of escape.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Incomplete analysis \n*   Failure to consider final step\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Net Progress:** The frog makes a net progress of 1 meter per day (3m up - 2m down).\n2.  **Distance to Top:** The frog needs to cover 27 meters to reach the point where it can escape (30m - 3m final jump).\n3.  **Days to 27m:** It will take the frog 27 days to reach 27 meters (27m / 1m per day).\n4.  **Final Day:** On the 28th day, the frog will jump 3 meters from the 27-meter point and escape the well.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Analyze Net Progress:** Determine the net progress made per day or unit of time.\n2.  **Calculate Distance to Goal:** Identify the total distance or steps needed to reach the goal.\n3.  **Consider Final Step:** Analyze what happens on the final step or day, especially if there's a unique action like a final jump or leap.\n4.  **Account for Full Duration:** Include the final day or step in the total count to reach the goal.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Break Down the Problem:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n*   **Consider All Stages:** Think through each stage of the process, including the beginning, middle, and end.\n*   **Visualize the Scenario:** Create a mental or physical representation of the problem to understand the actions and progress.\n*   **Review and Revise:** Double-check your reasoning and calculations to ensure all aspects are considered. \n"
