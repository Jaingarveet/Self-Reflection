Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\n\nThought:\nLet's use algebra to solve this. Let A be the amount Arjun has and S be the amount Sajal has. We can set up two equations based on the given information:\n*   **Equation 1:** If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice what Arjun has left: 2(A-30) = S+30 \n*   **Equation 2:** If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice what Sajal has left: 3(S-10) = A+10\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get A = 62 and S = 34.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
