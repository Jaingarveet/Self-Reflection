Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from incorrectly accounting for the identical nature of the chairs. I considered the order of Susan and Tim but failed to recognize that the position of Zen relative to them wouldn't create unique arrangements due to the chairs being indistinguishable.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Permutation error\n*   Identical objects error\n*   Counting principle error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Susan and Tim's positions:** There are only two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim as Susan must be to Tim's left: (Susan, Tim) or (Tim, Susan). \n2.  **Zen's position:** Since the chairs are identical, Zen's position relative to Susan and Tim doesn't create a new arrangement. Whether Zen sits to the left, between, or to the right of Susan and Tim, the arrangement remains the same.\nTherefore, there are only **2 possible arrangements**.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify restrictions:** Carefully analyze the problem for any restrictions or conditions (like Susan being to the left of Tim).\n2.  **Consider identical objects:** Determine if there are identical objects or positions involved and how they impact the number of unique arrangements.\n3.  **Apply counting principles:** Use appropriate counting principles (permutations, combinations) while considering the restrictions and identical objects.\n4.  **Account for symmetry:** If symmetry is present due to identical objects, adjust the count to avoid overcounting arrangements.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of the problem, especially terms like \"identical\" or \"distinct.\"\n*   **Visualize:** Try to visualize the problem or draw diagrams to understand the arrangements better.\n*   **Break it down:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps to avoid confusion.\n*   **Check for overcounting:** Always be mindful of potential overcounting due to symmetry or identical objects. \n*   **Practice:** Solve various permutation and combination problems to strengthen your understanding of counting principles. \n"
