What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\n\nThought:\nThe company needs to make a profit of $626,400 per year, which is $52,200 per month. \nThey produce 420 units per month, so they need to make a profit of $52,200 / 420 = $124.29 per unit.\nThe production cost is $110 per unit, so the selling price must be at least $110 + $124.29 = $234.29.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI made a rounding error when calculating the required profit per unit. I rounded $124.2857... down to $124.29, leading to an incorrect minimum selling price.\nError Keywords:\n - Rounding error\n - Decimal truncation error\n - Approximation error\nSolution:\nAnnual profit needed: $626,400\nMonthly profit needed: $626,400 / 12 = $52,200\nUnits produced per month: 420\nRequired profit per unit: $52,200 / 420 = $124.2857... (keep the full decimal for now)\nProduction cost per unit: $110\nMinimum selling price: $110 + $124.2857... = $234.2857...\nSince the selling price must be an integer, we round up to the nearest dollar to ensure the profit target is met: $235\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the required monthly profit by dividing the annual profit target by 12.\n2. Calculate the required profit per unit by dividing the monthly profit by the number of units produced per month.\n3. Avoid rounding off the profit per unit prematurely; keep the full decimal value for accuracy.\n4. Add the production cost per unit to the required profit per unit to find the minimum selling price.\n5. If the minimum selling price is not an integer, round it UP to the nearest dollar to ensure the profit target is met. \nAdvice:\n - Be cautious with rounding, especially when dealing with financial calculations.\n - When in doubt, round up to ensure you meet the minimum requirement.\n - Consider using a calculator or spreadsheet software to avoid manual calculation errors. \n - Always review your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context. \n"
