Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My approach was partially correct, but I only considered the inner cube and neglected the unpainted faces between the inner and outer layers.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Incomplete analysis\n*   Neglecting internal faces\n*   Three-dimensional geometry visualization error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Outer Cube:** The outer cube has 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 small cubes.\n2.  **Inner Cube:** Removing the outer layer leaves a 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 small cube core.\n3.  **Unpainted Cubes:** The number of unpainted cubes is the difference: 125 - 27 = 98 cubes.\n4.  **Unpainted Faces:** Each unpainted cube has 6 faces, so there are 98 x 6 = 588 unpainted faces.\n5.  **Subtracting Exposed Faces:** However, some of these faces are exposed to the outside and painted. We need to subtract these. \n    *   Each face of the inner cube has 9 exposed faces (3x3 grid). \n    *   Since there are 6 faces on the inner cube, we have 6 x 9 = 54 exposed faces to subtract.\n6.  **Total Unpainted Faces:** Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is 588 - 54 = 534.\n## Instructions for Future\n1.  **Visualize the Structure:** Clearly visualize the 3D structure of the cube and its layers.\n2.  **Consider All Layers:** Don't just focus on the inner or outer layer; consider the unpainted faces between them.\n3.  **Calculate Unpainted Cubes:** Find the difference between the total number of cubes and the inner cube's cubes.\n4.  **Account for Exposed Faces:** Remember to subtract the exposed faces of the inner cube that are painted.\n## General Advice\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Practice visualizing and manipulating 3D objects in your mind.\n*   **Break Down Complex Shapes:** Divide complex shapes into simpler components for easier analysis.\n*   **Consider All Surfaces:**  When dealing with painted surfaces, consider all sides and potential hidden faces. \n*   **Review and Learn:** Analyze mistakes to understand the reasoning gaps and avoid them in the future. \n"
