In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Overgeneralization\n - Assumption error\n - Logical fallacy\n"

This was due to an overgeneralization error, where I assumed that all descriptions of monstrous beasts would necessarily involve violations of the laws of nature. This assumption was not supported by the context provided.\n**Solution:** To avoid this error in the future, I will pay closer attention to the specific details provided in the context and avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated. I will also consider alternative interpretations of the information presented and ensure that my answer is consistent with all aspects of the context.\n**Correct Answer:** The correct answer to the question is **E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.** This is because the context explicitly states that some horror stories about monstrous beasts employ symbolism, and that these stories often describe violations of the laws of nature. This option is consistent with all aspects of the context and does not involve any overgeneralizations or assumptions.\n## Action: Answer(\"E\")"
