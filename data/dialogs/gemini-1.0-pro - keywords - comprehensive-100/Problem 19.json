I mistakenly assumed that if one statement is true, the other must be false, leading to the absurd conclusion.\n## Correct Answer and Explanation:\nThe correct answer is **D: The words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false.**\nThis answer acknowledges that both statements can be true or false independently, without necessarily leading to a contradiction. The absurdity arises from the attempt to combine these statements in a way that implies a direct comparison between money and friends, which is logically flawed.\n## Key Takeaways:\n* Be cautious of drawing conclusions based on seemingly contradictory statements.\n* Analyze the logical relationships between statements to avoid reaching absurd conclusions.\n* Recognize that statements can be true or false independently, without necessarily implying a direct comparison.\n## Action:\nAnswer(\"D\")"
