This is because liquids are incompressible, meaning their volume cannot be significantly changed by applying pressure.\n* A liquid will not keep its shape when transferred to a larger container. This is because liquids take the shape of their container.\n* The volume of a liquid can be slightly reduced by adding pressure, but not greatly.\n* The shape of a liquid can be changed by increasing its temperature, but this is not the best description of a liquid sample.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
