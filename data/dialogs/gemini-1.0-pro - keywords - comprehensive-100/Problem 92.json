I am now ready to answer the question correctly.\nThought:\n* Serous cystadenoma is the most common type of ovarian tumor.\n* Mucinous cystadenoma is the second most common type of ovarian tumor.\n* Dermoid cyst is a type of teratoma, which is a tumor that contains tissues from all three germ layers.\n* Theca lutein cyst is a type of functional cyst that is associated with pregnancy.\n* Of these four types of ovarian tumors, dermoid cysts are the most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy. This is because they are often pedunculated, meaning that they are attached to the ovary by a thin stalk. This stalk can become twisted, cutting off the blood supply to the tumor and causing it to die.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
