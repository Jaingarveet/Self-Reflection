I was so focused on the increase in violent crime that I overlooked the fact that the argument was about the likelihood of an average citizen becoming a victim of a violent crime.\nImproved Response:\nThe argument claims that the average citizen is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. However, if the town's overall crime rate has only risen slightly, then the likelihood of an average citizen becoming a victim of a violent crime may not have increased as much as the argument suggests. Therefore, answer choice (A) most seriously weakens the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
