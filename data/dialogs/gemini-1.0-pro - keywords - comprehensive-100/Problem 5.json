I used the wrong value for the number of terms (n) in the series, which led to an inaccurate result.\n**Corrected Approach:**\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n    - Youngest member's age (a) = 7 years\n    - Common difference (d) = 3 months = 0.25 years\n    - Sum of ages of all members (S) = 250 years\n2. **Find the number of terms (n):**\n    - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n    - Substitute the given values: 250 = n/2 [2(7) + (n-1)(0.25)]\n    - Simplify and solve for n: 500 = n(14 + 0.25n) --> n^2 + 56n - 2000 = 0\n    - Factor the quadratic equation: (n-20)(n+100) = 0\n    - Since the age cannot be negative, n = 20\n3. **Therefore, the number of members in the club is 20.**\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\") \n"
