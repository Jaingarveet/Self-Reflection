        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.\n  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.\n  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.\n  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.\n  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.\n"

Therefore, the answer that would best justify the prediction is one that further emphasizes the game's popularity and appeal beyond what is already known.\n\nChoice B states that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game. This indicates that the game is substantial and engaging enough to keep players occupied for an extended period, suggesting that it offers good value for money and is likely to be highly regarded. This popularity would lead to increased sales over time as more people hear about the game through word of mouth and seek to purchase it.\n\nWhile choices A, C, D, and E provide additional information, they do not directly strengthen the link between the initial findings (high rentals, sales meeting expectations) and the prediction (sales will exceed expectations) as effectively as choice B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
