The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.\nQuestion: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.\n  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.\n"
