These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional \"talk\" methods.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends?\nChoices:\n  A: All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes.\n  B: improvements in a patient's behavior produced by \"talk\" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry.\n  C: Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change.\n  D: If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable.\n  E: Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is \"talk\" therapy.\n"
