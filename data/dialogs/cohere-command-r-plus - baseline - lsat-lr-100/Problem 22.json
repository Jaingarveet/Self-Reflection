The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.\n  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.\n  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.\n"

If there was another text published before both Jordan's and Grey's books that contains the same metaphor, then it is possible that they both drew inspiration from this earlier source, rather than Grey copying directly from Jordan.\n\nTherefore, Choice A most weakens the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
