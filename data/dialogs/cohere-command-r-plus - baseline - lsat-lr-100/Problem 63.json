But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.\nQuestion: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.\n  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.\n  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.\n  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.\n  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.\n"

This is a false dichotomy, as there may be other factors at play or alternative explanations for the result.\nThis type of reasoning is most similar to choice A. The argument states that if there had been an invasion or climatic change, architectural changes would have occurred. As there were no architectural changes, the conclusion is that there must not have been an invasion. This ignores other possible reasons for architectural continuity.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
