The original statements tell us that most films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international festivals, and that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, it must be true that some of the films that won prizes at international festivals were Canadian films.\n\nStatement D is not necessarily true as it is possible that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international festival, we just know that most films did so.\n\nStatement E is not necessarily true as it is possible that all films that won prizes at international festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
