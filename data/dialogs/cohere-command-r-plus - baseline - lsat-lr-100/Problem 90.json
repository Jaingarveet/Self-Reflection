        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\n"

        "content": "Thought: \nThe science journalist's statements support the inference that the presence or absence of lithium in the atmosphere of a celestial object is indicative of the object's mass and the functionality of its nuclear furnace.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because not all celestial objects without lithium in their atmospheres are stars with less mass than the Sun. Some may be brown dwarfs or other objects with different formation histories.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because not all celestial objects with lithium in their atmospheres have incompletely mixed elements. Stars more massive than the Sun also have lithium but their elements are thoroughly mixed due to higher temperatures and pressures.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because it is a negative statement that is too broad. While it is true that the presence of lithium suggests an object is not a brown dwarf, the absence of lithium could be due to other factors besides being a brown dwarf.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because it is a negative statement that is too broad and misleading. There may be celestial objects with lithium that have less mass than the Sun, but they are not brown dwarfs because they have functional nuclear furnaces that can consume lithium.\n\nChoice E is correct because it is the most specific and accurate inference based on the information provided. Brown dwarfs are defined by their mass range and the fact that they do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces that can consume lithium. Therefore, if a celestial object has lithium in its atmosphere, it cannot be less massive than a brown dwarf, as it would then fall into the category of a planet or smaller substellar object.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice E.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
