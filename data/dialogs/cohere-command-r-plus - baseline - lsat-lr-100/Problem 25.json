        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\n"

This legal principle states that someone cannot benefit from or use as evidence any information obtained through illegal means, even if it is for a just cause.\n\nIn each of the choices, a situation is described where one party has committed a wrongdoing, and another party responds with a similar or related wrongdoing. The correct answer will illustrate a situation where the response is not justifiable due to the nature of how the information was obtained or the method used.\n\nChoice A: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine because Long's response to Price's theft is a separate wrongdoing, and there is no mention of how Long obtained the information.\n\nChoice B: This scenario comes closest to illustrating the clean hands doctrine. Shakila's knowledge of her secretary's wrongdoing is based on her own past experience, which could be considered an illegal means of obtaining information.\n\nChoice C: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine because Sarah's parents could have obtained the information about her sneaking out from Takashi regardless of his curfew violation. The curfew violation does not impact the justifiability of their potential punishment for Sarah.\n\nChoice D: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine because the conservation officer's discovery of Kuttner's illegal traps is not inherently tied to the officer's trespass. The officer's trespass may be a separate ethical or legal issue, but it does not invalidate the discovery of Kuttner's wrongdoing.\n\nChoice E: This scenario does not illustrate the clean hands doctrine. While the board of directors may have pardoned similar improprieties in the past, this does not change the fact that Ramirez's actions were improper. The principle in the argument is focused on the means of obtaining evidence, not the consistency of punishment.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is choice B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
