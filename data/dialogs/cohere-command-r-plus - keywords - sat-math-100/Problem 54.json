So, $p(3) = (3 - 3)q(3) + (-2) = -2$. Thus, $x - 3$ is a factor of $p(x)$.\n\nReflection:\nI misinterpreted the question and incorrectly assumed that $p(x)$ must have a factor of $(x - 3)$ to yield a value of $-2$ when $p(3)$ is substituted. However, the remainder theorem states that the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$ is indeed $-2$, which is the value of $p(3)$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
