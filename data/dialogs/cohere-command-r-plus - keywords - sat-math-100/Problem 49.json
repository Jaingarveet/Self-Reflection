Focusing on the first equation and rearranging it, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n24x^2 + 25x + 446 &= 0 \\\\\n24x^2 + 64x - [REDACTED]9x + 446 &= 0 \\\\\n6(4x^2 + 8x) - [REDACTED]9(x + 11) &= 0 \\\\\n6(2x + 1)(2x + 4) - [REDACTED]9(x + 11) &= 0 \\\\\n(6x + 11)(2x + 4) - [REDACTED]9(x + 11) &= 0 \\\\\n(6x + 11)(2x + 4 - [REDACTED]) &= 0 \\\\\n(6x + 11)(2x + 1) &= 0 \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the solutions for $x$ are $x = -\\frac{11}{6}$ and $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Now, we can plug these values back into the original equation to find the value of $a$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{24x^2 + 25x - 47}{ax - 2} &= -8x - [REDACTED] - \\frac{5[REDACTED]}{ax - 2} \\\\\n\\frac{24(-\\frac{11}{6})^2 + 25(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 47}{a(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 2} &= -8(-\\frac{11}{6}) - [REDACTED] - \\frac{5[REDACTED]}{a(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 2} \\\\\n\\frac{24(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 25(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 47}{a(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 2} &= -8(-\\frac{1}{2}) - [REDACTED] - \\frac{5[REDACTED]}{a(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 2} \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying these expressions, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= [REDACTED] \\\\\na &= [REDACTED] \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $a$ is a constant, it must satisfy both equations. Therefore, the correct value of $a$ is $[REDACTED]$, which is choice [REDACTED].\n"
