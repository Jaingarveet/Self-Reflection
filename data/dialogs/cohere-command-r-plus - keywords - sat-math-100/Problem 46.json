As the outlier is a large value, its removal will significantly reduce the sum, thus lowering the mean. \n\nThe range will also change, but not as drastically as the mean. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Removing the outlier will result in a new maximum value, but the minimum will remain unchanged, so the range will decrease by a set amount. \n\nThe median will be relatively unaffected. With an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value when they are arranged in order. Removing the highest value will not impact the middle value significantly, especially with many similar values in the data set. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 'A: Mean'.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
