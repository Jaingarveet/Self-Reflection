We can calculate the slope using any two points from the table:\n\n$m=\\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\\frac{1+2}{-2}=3$\n\nNow, we can use the y-intercept, which is given as $f(0)$, to find $b$:\n\n$b=f(0)=3$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the linear function is $f(n)=3n+3$, which matches option [REDACTED]: $f(n)=3n-5$.\n"
