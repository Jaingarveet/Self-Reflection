I correctly found the relationship between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates for the line ($y = \\frac{1}{7}x$), but I incorrectly assumed that the $x$ value had to be 1. Upon reflection, I realized that the $x$ value can be any number, and we should compare the ratio of the $x$ and $y$ values to identify points on the line.\n\nCorrect answer: None of the given points lie exactly on the line, but we can come close by choosing a point with coordinates that are multiples of the slope (e.g., $x = 7, y = 1$)."
