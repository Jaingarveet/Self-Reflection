        "content": "Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by not considering the relationship between the angles of elevation and the distance traveled by the car.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to use trigonometry and the properties of similar triangles.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tower as h, the initial distance from the car to the tower as d1, and the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° as d2.\n\nSince the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, we can write the following equations using the tangent function:\n\ntan(45°) = h/d1\ntan(60°) = h/(d1 - d), where d is the distance traveled by the car in 10 minutes.\n\nWe can simplify these equations as follows:\n\nd1 = h\nd1 - d = h/√3\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\nd = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3) = h(√3 - 1)/√3\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance d2, which is equal to d1 - d = h/√3.\n\nSince the car is traveling at a uniform speed, we can write the following proportion:\n\nd/10 = d2/t, where t is the time it takes for the car to travel the remaining distance d2.\n\nSolving for t, we get:\n\nt = 10 \\* d2/d = 10 \\* (h/√3) / (h(√3 - 1)/√3) = 10 \\* √3 / (√3 - 1) = 5(√3 + 1)\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
