The question is about the measure of a minor arc in a circle, not about the location of a university or the number of letters in a city or state name.\n\nThought:\nSince B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB and minor arc BC are equal. Minor arc AC is given as 160°, so minor arc AB and minor arc BC are each 80°. Minor arc BD is given as 150°, so minor arc AD is equal to minor arc AB + minor arc BD = 80° + 150° = 230°. However, this is the measure of the major arc AD. To find the measure of the minor arc AD, we subtract the measure of the major arc AD from 360°: 360° - 230° = 130°.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
