The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train?\nChoices:\n  A: 0.9\n  B: 0.8\n  C: 0.6\n  D: 0.65\n  E: 1.5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, so they will arrive at the station at the same time every 10 minutes.\nThe main line service starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 [REDACTED].M., which means that the harbor line train will arrive 2 minutes after the main line train.\nSince the frequency is 10 minutes, the man will have to wait for either 2 minutes or 8 minutes for the next train.\nThe probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time he waits for the first train to the total time between the arrival of two consecutive trains.\nThe probability of catching the main line train is 2/10 = 0.2, and the probability of catching the harbor line train is 8/10 = [REDACTED].\nThe total probability of catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of catching either train, which is 0.2 + [REDACTED] = 1.\nHowever, since the man can only catch one train, the probability of catching the first train is the probability of catching the train that arrives first.\nThe harbor line train arrives 2 minutes after the main line train, so the probability of catching the first train is the probability of catching the main line train, which is 0.2.\n"
