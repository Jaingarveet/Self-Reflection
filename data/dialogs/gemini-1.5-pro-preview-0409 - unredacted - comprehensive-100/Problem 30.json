        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the placement of book K. I assumed K being above F meant it couldn't be on the middle shelf, overlooking the possibility of F being on the bottom shelf.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Assumption error\n*   Placement constraint misunderstanding \n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **G on Top Shelf:** We know G is on the top shelf. \n2. **I on Middle Shelf:** I is always on the middle shelf.\n3. **K above F:** K needs to be above F, but this doesn't restrict K to the top shelf.\n4. **O above L:** O needs to be above L, so L cannot be on the top shelf.\n5. **F with M:** F and M are always together.\n6. **Bottom Shelf Capacity:** Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top, and G is alone on top, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\nConsidering these constraints:\n*   **Top Shelf:** G\n*   **Middle Shelf:** I, K, L (possible)\n*   **Bottom Shelf:** F, M, O (possible)\nTherefore, the middle shelf could be **I, K, and L (Option D)**. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1. **List all constraints explicitly:** Write down each placement rule clearly.\n2. **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about placement based on partial information.\n3. **Work through scenarios:** Test different shelf arrangements that satisfy the constraints.\n4. **Pay attention to shelf capacity:** Remember the rule about the number of books on each shelf.\n5. **Eliminate impossible options:** Use the process of elimination based on the constraints.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read carefully:** Understand the problem and all its conditions before starting.\n*   **Be flexible in your thinking:** Don't get locked into one interpretation of the rules.\n*   **Visualize the problem:**  Try drawing a diagram or using objects to represent the books and shelves.\n*   **Check your work:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions. \n*   **Practice similar problems:**  The more you practice, the better you will become at logical reasoning and problem-solving.\n"
