While it has skin-lightening properties, it's primarily used in topical creams for hyperpigmentation and not typically in chemical peels due to its gentler action.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Knowledge Gap\n*   Agent Classification \n*   Chemical Peel Agents\n**Solution:**\n1.  **Glycolic Acid:**  A common alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) used in chemical peels for exfoliation and collagen stimulation.\n2.  **Kojic Acid:** Primarily used in topical creams for hyperpigmentation and melasma treatment, not typically in chemical peels.\n3.  **Phenol:** A deep peeling agent used for severe wrinkles and scars, requiring careful application due to its potency.\n4.  **Salicylic Acid:** A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) used in chemical peels for acne, oily skin, and exfoliation.\nTherefore, the answer is **B: Kojic Acid** as it's not a typical chemical peel agent.\n## Future Improvement\n**Instructions:**\n1.  **Review Chemical Peel Agents:** Refresh knowledge on common agents like AHAs, BHAs, and phenol, understanding their applications and strengths.\n2.  **Cross-Check Information:** When unsure, consult reliable sources like dermatology textbooks or medical journals to verify agent usage.\n3.  **Consider Context:** Analyze the question's context, focusing on the specific application (chemical peels) rather than general skin treatments.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Maintain Knowledge Currency:** Regularly update your medical knowledge base with the latest research and treatment modalities.\n*   **Develop Critical Appraisal Skills:** Evaluate information sources for accuracy and relevance to the specific context.\n*   **Recognize Knowledge Gaps:** Be aware of limitations in your knowledge and actively seek to address them through research and learning.\n"
