I incorrectly assumed all suprarenal veins drained via the renal veins.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Knowledge gap\n*   Anatomy misconception\n*   Venous drainage error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Recall the function of the inferior vena cava:** It collects deoxygenated blood from the lower body and returns it to the heart.\n2.  **Consider the options:**\n    *   Superior and inferior mesenteric veins are part of the hepatic portal system, not directly connected to the inferior vena cava.\n    *   Renal veins do drain directly into the inferior vena cava.\n    *   **Right suprarenal vein:** This vein drains the right adrenal gland and, unlike the left, directly connects to the inferior vena cava. \n3.  **Choose the correct option:** Based on the above, the right suprarenal vein (C) is the correct answer. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Review the anatomy of the venous system**, paying close attention to the connections between major veins and their tributaries.\n2.  **Specifically focus on the drainage patterns of the adrenal glands**, noting the difference between the right and left suprarenal veins.\n3.  **When encountering questions about venous drainage, systematically eliminate options** based on your knowledge of the circulatory system.\n4.  **If unsure, consider the anatomical location and function of the structures involved** to make an educated guess.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Continuously update and refine your knowledge base** in medicine and anatomy.\n*   **Pay attention to exceptions and variations** within anatomical systems.\n*   **Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving** that involves elimination and logical reasoning.\n*   **Use anatomical and physiological principles to guide your reasoning** when faced with uncertainty. \n*   **Practice applying your knowledge to different scenarios** to reinforce understanding.\n"
