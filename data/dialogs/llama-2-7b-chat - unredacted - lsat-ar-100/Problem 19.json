Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nThank you for providing the feedback.

I appreciate your constructive criticism, and I will make sure to format my answers correctly in the future.\n\nTo answer the question, I will follow the instructions provided:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe correct answer is indeed (B) Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nLet's assume that Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then according to the problem, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Irving's report must be given on Wednesday.\n\nSo, the answer is (B) Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions."
