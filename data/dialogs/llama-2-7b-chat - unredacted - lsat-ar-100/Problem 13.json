Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (D) Hong testifies on Tuesday.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Franco cannot testify on Monday.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so at least one witness must testify on Monday.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday.\n\nThe only possible schedule that meets all the conditions is:\n\nMonday: Franco, Garcia, Hong\nTuesday: Iturbe, Jackson\nWednesday: None\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Hong testifies on Tuesday.\n"

I thought it meant that Franco could not testify on Monday, but it actually means that Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.\n\nHere's my original answer and why it is incorrect:\n\nOriginal answer: (A) Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n\nReasoning: I thought that since Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, Franco must testify on Wednesday. However, this is not the case, as Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.\n\nThank you for providing the correct answer and explanation. I will make sure to be more careful and thorough in my reasoning in the future."
