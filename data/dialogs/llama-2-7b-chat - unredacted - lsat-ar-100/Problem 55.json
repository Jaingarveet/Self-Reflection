Here is how I would answer the question again:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nThe acceptable schedule of witnesses is:\n\nMonday: Garcia and Jackson\nTuesday: Franco and Iturbe\nWednesday: Garcia and Hong\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Franco testifies on Monday.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, as specified in the problem.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco and Iturbe testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong testifies on Wednesday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday, so Garcia testifies on Monday.\n\nBy meeting all the conditions given in the problem, this schedule of witnesses is the only acceptable one."
