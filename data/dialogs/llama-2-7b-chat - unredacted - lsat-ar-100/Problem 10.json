The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the organizer's selection of works?\nChoices:\n  A: one French novel, two Russian novels, one French play, one Russian play\n  B: two French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays, one Russian play\n  C: two French novels, two Russian novels, two French plays\n  D: three French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays\n  E: three French novels, two Russian novels, one Russian play\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nYou have correctly analyzed the problem and identified the possible selections based on the given requirements. Great job!\n\nThe correct answer is indeed option E: three French novels, two Russian novels, one Russian play. This selection meets all the requirements given in the problem, as you have mentioned:\n\n1. No more than four French works are selected, so we can eliminate options A and E, as they have more than four French works.\n2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected, so we can eliminate option C, as it has only two novels.\n3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so we can eliminate option B, as it has more Russian novels than French novels.\n4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so we can eliminate option D, as it selects the Russian play.\n\nWell done! It's important to carefully analyze the problem and identify the possible selections based on the given requirements.\n\nBy the way, do you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss related to law or any other field?
