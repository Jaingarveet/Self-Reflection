Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nThank you for providing the reflection and analysis of the problem. However, I must point out that the answer you provided is not in the correct format.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, you should use the following format:\n\nAction: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")\n\nWhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is (D) The toy store is in space 6, so the answer should be:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n"

Here is my reflection and analysis of the problem:\n\nReflection: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reviewing my solution, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the pharmacy had to be next to the optometrist, which led me to choose the wrong answer.\n\nAnalysis: The problem states that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. This means that the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist, as the optometrist is located in the middle of the row. Therefore, the only possible location for the toy store is space 6.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention, and I hope this corrected answer helps!"
