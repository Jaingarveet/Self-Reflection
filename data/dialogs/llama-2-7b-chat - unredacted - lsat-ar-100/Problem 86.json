Each bay holds a different type of cargo, and the types are: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n\n* The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n* The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n* The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n* The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nUsing this information, we can determine the type of cargo in each bay as follows:\n\n* Bay 1: fuel\n* Bay 2: grain\n* Bay 3: livestock\n* Bay 4: produce\n* Bay 5: machinery\n* Bay 6: textiles\n\nNow, let's count the number of bays where the type of cargo is completely determined:\n\n* Bay 4: produce (the type of cargo is completely determined since we know it is hold grain)\n* Bay 5: machinery (the type of cargo is completely determined since we know it is hold livestock)\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) four.\n\nI apologize for my previous mistake and hope this revised answer is correct."
