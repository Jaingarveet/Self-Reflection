Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat job!
