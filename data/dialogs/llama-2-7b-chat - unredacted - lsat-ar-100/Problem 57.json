I appreciate your input and will make sure to format my answers correctly in the future.\n\nTo answer the question, I will use the information provided in the problem statement.\n\nAccording to the problem, exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n\nTuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce that if George and Lenore give reports on the same day, they must give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give their reports on Wednesday is (B) Helen and Nina.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
