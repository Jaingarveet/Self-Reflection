The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat job! You have correctly analyzed the information given in the question and arrived at the correct answer. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the steps you took to arrive at the answer:\n\n1. You identified the conditions given in the question and analyzed them to determine the possible combinations of students who review Tamerlane.\n2. You used condition 1 to conclude that Kramer and O'Neill are the only combination that satisfies all the conditions.\n3. You used condition 2 to conclude that Jiang does not review Tamerlane.\n4. You used condition 3 to conclude that Lopez does not review Tamerlane.\n5. You used condition 4 to conclude that Megregian reviews at least one play that Kramer and Lopez do not review.\n6. You considered the possible combinations of students who review Tamerlane and arrived at the conclusion that the accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nWell done! Your thought process and steps are clear and well-organized. Here are some additional tips to help you with similar questions in the future:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key conditions and constraints given in the problem.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems or steps, and analyze each step separately.\n3. Use logical reasoning and deduction to arrive at the conclusion.\n4. Consider all possible combinations or scenarios and eliminate those that are inconsistent with the given conditions.\n5. Double-check your calculations and conclusions to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and become more confident in your ability to solve complex problems in law and other fields.\n"
