Here's how I would answer the question again:\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nExplanation:\n\nI started by reviewing the conditions provided in the problem:\n\n* Monday: exactly six students will give individual oral reports.\n* Tuesday: exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n* Wednesday: exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n* George can give a report on Tuesday.\n* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.\n* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nUsing a truth table, I represented the conditions and deduced the possible schedules for the students' reports:\n\n| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 students give reports | 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon | 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon |\n| George gives a report | 1 report in the morning, 1 report in the afternoon | 1 report in the morning, 1 report in the afternoon |\n| Olivia does not give an afternoon report | 1 report in the morning, 1 report in the afternoon | 1 report in the morning, 1 report in the afternoon |\n| Robert does not give an afternoon report | 1 report in the morning, 1 report in the afternoon | 1 report in the morning, 1 report in the afternoon |\n| Nina gives a report | 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon | 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon |\n| Helen and Irving must give reports if Nina gives a report | 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon | 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon |\n\nFrom the truth table, I identified the schedule that matches the conditions in the problem:\n\nSchedule E:\n\n* Monday: 6 students give reports (Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Robert)\n* Tuesday: 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon (Helen, Irving)\n* Wednesday: 2 reports in the morning, 2 reports in the afternoon (Kyle, Lenore)\n\nTherefore, the schedule of the students' reports is schedule E."
