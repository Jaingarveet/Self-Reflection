At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat job! You have correctly analyzed the information given in the question and evaluated each of the options. Your conclusion that none of the options are true and your answer of \"None of the Above\" are both correct.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why each option is false:\n\nA: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on. - False, as M is placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nB: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on. - False, as G is placed on the middle shelf.\n\nC: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on. - False, as F is placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nD: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on. - False, as O is placed on the top shelf.\n\nE: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on. - False, as L is placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nGreat job!\n"

Here's my answer to the question:\n\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\nThe reason why none of the options are true is because the information provided in the question does not allow us to determine which one of the options is true. For example, option A states that O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on, but we are not told which shelf M is placed on, so we cannot determine if O is indeed placed on a higher shelf than M. Similarly, options B, C, D, and E all have similar issues, as we are not provided with enough information to determine which one of the options is true. Therefore, the best answer is \"None of the Above.\""
