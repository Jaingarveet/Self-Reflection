        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\nChoices:\n  A: 438\n  B: 550\n  C: 500\n  D: 450\n  E: 498\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a calculation error when finding the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface. \nI used the formula for the volume of the outer surface instead of the formula for the surface area of the outer surface. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Formula error\n - Surface area error\nSolution:\nThe outer surface of the cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150 square cm.\nThe number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface is 5x5x6 - 3x3x6 = 150.\nEach face of a smaller cube has an area of 1 square cm, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 150 x 6 = 900.\nThe number of faces that remain unpainted is 900 - 150 = 750.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the dimensions of the outer cube and the inner cube.\n2. Calculate the surface area of the outer cube.\n3. Calculate the surface area of the inner cube.\n4. Subtract the surface area of the inner cube from the surface area of the outer cube to find the surface area of the hollow cube.\n5. Calculate the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface.\n6. Multiply the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface by 6 to find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes.\n7. Subtract the number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the outer surface from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula for the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of its faces.\n"
