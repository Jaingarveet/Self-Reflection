Identify the two numbers to be added.\n2. Determine the sign of each number.\n3. Determine the absolute value of each number.\n4. Identify the larger absolute value.\n5. Identify the smaller absolute value.\n6. Subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value.\n7. Keep the sign of the larger number.\n8. Write the result with the correct sign.\n9. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n10. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct method to add two numbers with different signs.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the sign of a number determines whether it is positive or negative.\n"
