        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.\nChoices:\n  A: 238\n  B: 289\n  C: 200\n  D: 287\n  E: 187\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in calculating the distance traveled by the plane when they meet. \nI multiplied the speed of the ship by the time instead of multiplying it by 10 times the time. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Multiplication error\n - Algebraic manipulation error\nSolution:\nLet's assume the speed of the ship is \"s\" and the time it takes to meet the plane is \"t\". \nThe distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is 180 miles.\nThe distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is 10s*t.\nThe total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented as s*t + 10s*t = 11s*t.\nThe distance traveled by the ship when they meet is s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: s*t = 180\nThe distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: 10s*t = 11s*t - 180\nSolving for t, we get t = 20.\nSubstituting t in the formula s*t = 180, we get s = 9.\nThe distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t = 10*9*20 = 1800.\nTherefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 1800 = 1980 miles.\nDividing 1980 by 10, we get 198.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the speeds of the ship and the plane.\n2. Identify the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane.\n3. Identify the distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship.\n4. Write an equation that represents the total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet.\n5. Write an equation that represents the distance traveled by the ship when they meet.\n6. Write an equation that represents the distance traveled by the plane when they meet.\n7. Solve the system of equations to find the time it takes for the plane and the ship to meet.\n8. Substitute the time into the equation for the distance traveled by the ship to find the speed of the ship.\n9. Substitute the time into the equation for the distance traveled by the plane to find the distance traveled by the plane when they meet.\n10. Add the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane to the distance traveled by the plane when they meet to find the distance from the starting point when they meet.\n11. Check your calculations and final answer for accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always define your variables and equations before solving the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to use algebraic manipulation to solve systems of equations.\n - Remember to use the formula distance = speed x time to solve distance, speed, and time problems.\n"
