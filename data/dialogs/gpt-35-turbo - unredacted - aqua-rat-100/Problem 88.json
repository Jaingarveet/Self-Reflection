After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\nChoices:\n  A: 10\n  B: 11.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 13.5\n  E: 15\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in calculating the total journey duration. I added the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance, but I forgot to add the time taken during the rain. \nError Keywords:\n - Addition error\n - Calculation error\n - Time calculation error\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the total distance of the journey.\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 100 x 10 = 1000 miles\nWhen the train covers a quarter of the distance, it has traveled 1000/4 = 250 miles.\nNow, the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles.\nLet's calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75 = 10 hours\nWhen it starts raining, the train has already traveled for 250 miles at a speed of 100 miles/hour. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75 = 10 hours\nThe total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance, the time taken to cover the remaining distance, and the time taken during the rain.\nTotal journey duration = 10 + 10 + 0.5 = 20.5 hours\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given information and what needs to be calculated.\n3. Break down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n4. Use the appropriate formulas and equations to solve each subproblem.\n5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to consider all the given information and any additional factors that may affect the problem.\n"

The train covers this distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour. The time taken to cover this distance is 10 hours. The train also travels for 0.5 hours at a speed of 100 miles/hour before it starts raining. Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 + 10 + 0.5 = 13 hours.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
