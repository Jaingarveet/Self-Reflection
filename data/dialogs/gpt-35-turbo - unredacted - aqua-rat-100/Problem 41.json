As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was\nChoices:\n  A: 8\n  B: 12\n  C: 16\n  D: 24\n  E: 25\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in setting up the equation. \nThe equation should have been 96/x = (96/(x-4)) + 4, not (96/x) = (96/x + 4) * (x-4).\nError Keywords:\n - Equation setup error\n - Algebraic manipulation error\n - Misunderstanding of the problem\nSolution:\nLet's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is \"x\".\nThe cost of eatables per person would be 96/x.\nWhen 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to pay an additional Rs. 4 each.\nSo, the new cost of eatables per person would be (96/(x-4)) + 4.\nWe can create an equation based on the above information and solve for \"x\".\nEquation: 96/x = (96/(x-4)) + 4\nSolving for \"x\":\n96/x - 96/(x-4) = 4\n(96(x-4) - 96x)/(x(x-4)) = 4\n-384/(x^2 - 4x) = 4\nx^2 - 4x = -96\nx^2 - 4x + 96 = 0\n(x-8)(x-12) = 0\nx = 8 or x = 12\nSince 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic must be less than or equal to 12.\nTherefore, the answer is A: 8.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the unknowns and assign variables to them.\n3. Write down the relevant equations based on the information given in the problem.\n4. Simplify and manipulate the equations to solve for the unknowns.\n5. Check your solution by plugging it back into the original problem.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the unknowns and assign variables to them.\n - Always write down the relevant equations based on the information given in the problem.\n - Always simplify and manipulate the equations to solve for the unknowns.\n - Always check your solution by plugging it back into the original problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n"
