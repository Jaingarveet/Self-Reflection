Read the problem carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Define variables and write down the equations.\n3. Simplify the equations and solve them step-by-step.\n4. Check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equation.\n5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always define variables and write down the equations.\n - Always simplify the equations and solve them step-by-step.\n - Always check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equation.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that algebraic equations can have multiple solutions, so always check your answer.\n"
