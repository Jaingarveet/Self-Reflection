Identify the principal amount borrowed.\n2. Identify the total amount paid back.\n3. Calculate the interest paid by subtracting the principal from the total amount paid back.\n4. Use the formula: Interest Rate = (Interest / Principal) x 100 to calculate the interest rate.\n5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Pay attention to the formatting of your answer.\n - Remember that percentages are expressed as a fraction of 100.\n"
