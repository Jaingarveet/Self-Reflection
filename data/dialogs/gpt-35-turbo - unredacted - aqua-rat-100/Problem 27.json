If 3 men drop out how much more will each have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift?\nChoices:\n  A: D/(M-3)\n  B: MD/3\n  C: M/(D-3)\n  D: 3D/(M2-3M)\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy mistake was in the calculation of the difference between the two contributions. \nThe correct difference is (D/M) - (D/(M-3)) = 3D/(M(M-3)).\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Algebraic error\n - Subtraction error\nSolution:\nLet the initial contribution of each man be x.\nSo, the total contribution of M men would be Mx = D.\nTherefore, x = D/M.\nAfter 3 men drop out, the total number of men becomes M-3.\nSo, the new contribution of each man would be (D/(M-3)).\nThe difference between the two contributions would be (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the initial contribution of each man.\n2. Calculate the total contribution of all M men.\n3. Calculate the initial contribution of each man using the formula x = D/M.\n4. Calculate the new number of men after 3 men drop out.\n5. Calculate the new contribution of each man using the formula (D/(M-3)).\n6. Calculate the difference between the two contributions using the formula (D/(M-3)) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n8. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that algebraic manipulation requires careful attention to detail.\n"
