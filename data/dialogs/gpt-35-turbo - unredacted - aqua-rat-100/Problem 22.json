        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy approach to the problem was incorrect. I assumed that Alex and Jacob made x toys and (35 - x) toys respectively, which is not correct. Also, I did not use the given information that both of them worked for almost similar hours. \nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Incorrect approach\n - Ignoring given information\nSolution:\nLet's assume that Alex and Jacob made a toys and b toys respectively.\nThe time taken by Alex and Jacob to make a toys and b toys respectively can be calculated using the formula: Time = (Work / Rate)\nLet's assume that Alex worked for t hours and Jacob worked for (t + d) hours.\nUsing the above information, we can form two equations and solve for d.\nEquation 1: t/7 + (t + d)/9 = 35\nEquation 2: a + b = 35\nSolving equation 1 for t, we get t = (315 - 4d)/23\nSubstituting t in equation 2, we get a = (23*35 - 9d)/23 = 35 - (9d/23)\nSince both of them worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that the difference in their working hours is negligible. Therefore, we can assume that d is very small compared to 315. \nUsing this approximation, we can solve for d as follows:\nt = (315 - 4d)/23 = (315/23) - (4d/23)\nSubstituting this value of t in equation 1, we get:\n(315/161) - (4d/161) + [(315/161) - (4d/161) + d]/9 = 35/161\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\nd = 17\nSubstituting d = 17 in the equation for a, we get:\na = 35 - (9d/23) = 15\nTherefore, Jacob made 20 toys.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given information and what needs to be calculated.\n3. Formulate equations based on the given information.\n4. Simplify the equations and solve for the unknowns.\n5. Check your solution and ensure that it satisfies all the given conditions.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the given information and avoid making assumptions.\n - Always use the correct formulae and equations to solve the problem.\n - Always simplify the equations and solve for the unknowns.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that approximation can be used if the difference is negligible.\n"
