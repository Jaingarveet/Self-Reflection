Simplify the expression inside the brackets using the order of operations (PEMDAS).\n2. Simplify the expression on the left-hand side by performing the arithmetic operations in the numerator and denominator.\n3. Isolate the missing value by using algebraic operations.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always use the order of operations (PEMDAS) to simplify expressions.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.\n"
