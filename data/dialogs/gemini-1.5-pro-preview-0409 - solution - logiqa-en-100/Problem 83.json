We must have either E or F.\n3. **J or K, but not both:** Similar to point 2, we must have either J or K to complete the team of 4.\n4. **J implies G:** This is a conditional statement. If J is in, G must be in. But if K is chosen instead of J, this condition doesn't apply.\n5. **F implies M:** This is another conditional statement. If F is chosen, M must be in. \n## Deduction:\n- If we choose **E**, we still need one from **J/K** and one from **F/M**. This doesn't lead to a definitive pair. \n- If we choose **F**, we must have **M** (condition 5). We still need one from **J/K**. This leads to two possibilities: F and J, or F and K. \n- Since **J implies G**, the only guaranteed pair when H is not playing is **F and G**.\nTherefore, Action: Answer(\"A\") \n"
