I likely focused too much on the specific details of the argument and not enough on the overall structure and logical flaws. The key to understanding this type of question is to identify the core fallacy in the reasoning.\n## Analysis of the Argument:\nThe argument presents a situation where finding an impartial judge for a debate seems impossible due to potential biases. However, the conclusion that this leads to an \"invincible\" situation is a flawed leap in logic. \n## Identifying the Shortcoming:\nThe argument assumes that having the same or different opinions automatically disqualifies someone from being a judge. This is a false dichotomy, as it ignores the possibility of individuals being able to set aside personal biases and judge based on objective criteria or logical reasoning. \nTherefore, the argument commits a **\"false dilemma\" fallacy** by presenting only two options (same opinion or different opinion) and ignoring other possibilities for fair judgement.\n## Action: \nAnswer(\"D\") \n"
