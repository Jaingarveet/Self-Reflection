The correct answer should highlight the potential conflict of interest arising from the inverse relationship between wages (cost) and profit.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n*   **A:** This option assumes employees hold shares, which is not stated in the context. \n*   **B:** This contradicts the context, as the inverse relationship between wages and profit creates a conflict. Higher wages (cost) mean lower profit for the boss, and vice versa.\n*   **C:** This aligns with the context. If employees don't share in the profit, their interest in higher wages directly conflicts with the boss's interest in higher profit.\n*   **D:**  While likely true in most cases, it's not the strongest conclusion supported by the context. The statement focuses on the *relationship* between wages and profit, not the absolute amounts.\n## Conclusion:\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
