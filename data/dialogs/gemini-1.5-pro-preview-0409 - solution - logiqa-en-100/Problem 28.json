This allows both J and K as options.\n    * **Scenario 1a (E & J):** Choosing J forces G to be chosen. This leaves one spot, which can be filled by either K or M (since F is not chosen). However, this violates condition 2 (J or K, but not both). So, this scenario is invalid.\n    * **Scenario 1b (E & K):** Choosing K allows either G or H to fill the remaining spots. This scenario is valid.\n* **Scenario 2 (F):** If F is chosen, E cannot be. This again allows both J and K as options.\n    * **Scenario 2a (F & J):** Similar to 1a, choosing J forces G, leaving one spot. This violates condition 2 again. So, this scenario is invalid.\n    * **Scenario 2b (F & K):** Choosing K allows either G or H to fill the remaining spots. However, choosing F also necessitates choosing M (condition 4). This leaves no space for either G or H. So, this scenario is also invalid.\n## Conclusion:\nThe only valid scenario is **Scenario 1b (E & K)**, which allows for either G or H to be chosen. Therefore, there isn't a single definitive pair that MUST be chosen. \n**Action: None of the provided options are the only possible choice.** \n"
