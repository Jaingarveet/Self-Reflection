The correct answer was **B: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years**. \nMy mistake stemmed from not focusing on the core weakness of the argument. I was distracted by factors like the spread of negativity and malicious online behavior, which, while relevant to the overall discussion of social atmosphere, didn't directly address the flawed comparison in the statistical analysis.\n## Applying the Learning:\nThe key flaw in the argument is that it assumes the increase in posts about negative and positive social issues directly reflects a deterioration of the social atmosphere. However, it fails to consider the significant increase in the number of internet users over the past five years. With a larger user base, an increase in posts about all kinds of issues is expected, even if the proportion of people concerned about these issues remains constant.\nTherefore, option B directly addresses this flaw by highlighting the increased user base, which weakens the claim that the social atmosphere is deteriorating. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
