I should have analyzed the given information more comprehensively to reach the correct conclusion.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Fuyi Station:** East of Haoyun, West of and adjacent to Huyao.\n2. **Jiushang Station:** Adjacent to Yinling and Haoyun, and East of Haoyun.\nFrom point 2, we know Jiushang is east of Haoyun and adjacent to both Haoyun and Yinling. This implies the following order:\n**Haoyun - Jiushang - Yinling**\nSince Fuyi is east of Haoyun and adjacent to Huyao, and we know the position of Haoyun relative to Jiushang and Yinling, we can deduce the complete order:\n**Fuyi - Haoyun - Jiushang - Yinling - Huyao**\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, based on the given information and deductions, we can conclude that **Huyao Station is on the east side**.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
