The goal was to identify the option that casts the most doubt on the expert's claim, not the one that supports it. \n## Analysis of Choices:\n* **A:** This option supports the expert's claim by highlighting the negative impact of the bridge on transportation.\n* **B:** This option casts doubt on the expert's claim by suggesting that the bridge's impact on international shipping is minimal, as most large ships dock below the bridge anyway.\n* **C:** This option suggests that dismantling the Nanjing bridge alone wouldn't solve the problem, as other bridges also have height limitations. This weakens the expert's argument for solely focusing on the Nanjing bridge.\n* **D:** This option directly contradicts the expert's claim by showing that large ships designed for the Yangtze River can already pass through the Nanjing bridge.\n## Conclusion:\n**Option D** raises the most doubt about the expert's viewpoint by demonstrating that the bridge's height limitations are not an insurmountable obstacle for large ships. \n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
