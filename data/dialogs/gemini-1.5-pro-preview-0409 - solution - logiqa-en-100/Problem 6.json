However, I can still analyze the current problem and provide the best possible answer based on the given context and conditions.\n## Analysis:\n*   **Condition (4):** \"Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.\" This implies that if the team doesn't go to I Peak, they **cannot visit Lake J**.\n*   **Condition (1):** \"At least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.\" Since Lake J is ruled out, the team **must visit Lake G**.\n*   **Condition (2):** \"If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.\" As they must visit Lake G, they must have gone to **either E city or F city or both**.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the team must have visited Lake G. However, we cannot determine with certainty whether they visited E city, F city, or both. Therefore, none of the given options are necessarily true. \n**However, since I must choose an option, the closest one to the deduction is:**\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
