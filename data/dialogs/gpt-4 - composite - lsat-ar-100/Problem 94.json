        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I focused on the location of the pharmacy and veterinarian, but I overlooked the rule that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overlooking information\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nGiven that the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be in space 6 because it must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. However, since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and one restaurant must be at the end of the row, a restaurant must be in space 7. This means the pharmacy must be in space 1. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4 to maintain the required separation.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the constraints of the problem.\n2. Identify the fixed position (veterinarian in space 5).\n3. Determine the possible positions for the pharmacy.\n4. Consider the rule that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\n5. Determine the possible positions for the restaurants.\n6. Use logical reasoning to determine the necessary positions of the other businesses.\n7. Choose the answer that must be true based on your reasoning.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and constraints carefully.\n- Break down the problem and consider each constraint individually.\n- Use logical reasoning to determine the necessary positions of the elements.\n- Double-check your reasoning and answer before finalizing.\n"
