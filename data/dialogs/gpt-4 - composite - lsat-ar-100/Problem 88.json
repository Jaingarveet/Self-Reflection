        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions and made an incorrect assumption. I assumed that if L and F were on the same shelf, then K and O must be on a higher shelf. However, the conditions only state that K must be on a higher shelf than F and O must be on a higher shelf than L. They do not necessarily have to be on the top shelf.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe conditions state that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, O is higher than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. \nIf we look at the choices:\n[REDACTED]: I and M are on the same shelf. This would mean that F is also on the middle shelf (since F and M are on the same shelf). Since K is higher than F, K must be on the top shelf. Since O is higher than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. This leaves G and H for the bottom shelf, which satisfies the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the placement of all the books is determined.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the question.\n2. Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n3. Consider each choice and how it would affect the placement of the books.\n4. Remember that a book being on a higher shelf than another book does not necessarily mean it is on the top shelf.\n5. Choose the answer that allows the placement of all the books to be determined.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and conditions carefully.\n- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n- Use logical reasoning to determine the effects of each choice.\n- Be careful not to misinterpret the conditions.\n"
