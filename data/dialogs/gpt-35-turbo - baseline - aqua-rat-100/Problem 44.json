So, we can find the total man-days required to complete the work:\n8 men × 6 days = 48 man-days\nWe want to find how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Let's use the same formula to solve for the number of men:\nMen × Days = Work\nMen × 1/2 day = 48 man-days\nMen = 48 man-days ÷ 1/2 day\nMen = 96\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
