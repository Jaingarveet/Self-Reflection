        "content": "Thought:\nThe sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.\nSince the numbers are odd, x must be an odd number.\nThe sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.\nIf the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.\nThe only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.\nTherefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be a multiple of 100.\nLet's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nAction: \nLet's start with the smallest number, 41. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, 41 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 44. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, 44 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 47. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, 47 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 67. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + 67 = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, 67 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 91. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, 91 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nAnswer: Answer(\"B\")"
