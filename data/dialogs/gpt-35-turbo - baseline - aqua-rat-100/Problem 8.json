Then, the bus fare for two persons will be 4x/3.\nThe total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus will be (6/2) * (4x/3) = 4x.\nThe total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train will be 8x.\nAccording to the question, the sum of these two fares is Rs. 1512. So, we can write the equation as:\n4x + 8x = 1512\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n12x = 1512\nx = 126\nTherefore, the train fare between the two places for one person is Rs. 126.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
