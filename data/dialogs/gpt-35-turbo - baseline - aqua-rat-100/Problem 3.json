        "content": "Thought:\nLet's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is x feet.\nAfter trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.\nThe area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.\nThe area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.\nThe area of a triangle can be calculated as (1/2) * base * height.\nSince the two triangles are identical, we can set up the equation (1/2) * (x-4) * h = 70, where h is the height of each triangle.\nSolving for h, we get h = 140 / (x-4).\nThe height of each triangle is also given by the Pythagorean theorem as sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2) = sqrt(8x - 16).\nEquating the two expressions for h, we get 140 / (x-4) = sqrt(8x - 16).\nSquaring both sides and simplifying, we get 8x^2 - 312x + 1960 = 0.\nSolving for x using the quadratic formula, we get x = 19.55 or x = 15.95.\nSince x represents the length of a side of the original square piece of cloth, we can discard the smaller solution and conclude that x = 19.55 feet.\nThe perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 78.2 feet, which we can round to 78 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\") - The correct answer is not among the choices. The correct answer is 78."
