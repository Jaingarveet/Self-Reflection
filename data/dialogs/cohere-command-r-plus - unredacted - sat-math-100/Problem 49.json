The issue is that this quadratic equation does not have any real roots, and therefore, my approach was incorrect. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Quadratic equation error\n- Complex number error\n\nSolution: We are given the equation:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{24x^2 + 25x - 47}{ax - 2} = -8x - 3 - \\frac{53}{ax - 2} \\, .\n\\end{equation*}\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{24x^2 + 25x - 47 + 468}{ax - 2} &= \\frac{-53 - 468}{ax - 2} \\\\\n\\frac{24x^2 + 25x + 421}{ax - 2} &= \\frac{-521}{ax - 2} \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nFor the equation to be true, the numerators must be equal, and the denominators must be equal:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n24x^2 + 25x + 421 &= -521 \\\\\nax - 2 &= ax - 2 \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe second equation is already satisfied. Focusing on the first equation and rearranging it, we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n24x^2 + 25x + 446 &= 0 \\\\\n24x^2 + 64x - 39x + 446 &= 0 \\\\\n6(4x^2 + 8x) - 39(x + 11) &= 0 \\\\\n6(2x + 1)(2x + 4) - 39(x + 11) &= 0 \\\\\n(6x + 11)(2x + 4) - 39(x + 11) &= 0 \\\\\n(6x + 11)(2x + 4 - 3) &= 0 \\\\\n(6x + 11)(2x + 1) &= 0 \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the solutions for $x$ are $x = -\\frac{11}{6}$ and $x = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Now, we can plug these values back into the original equation to find the value of $a$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{24x^2 + 25x - 47}{ax - 2} &= -8x - 3 - \\frac{53}{ax - 2} \\\\\n\\frac{24(-\\frac{11}{6})^2 + 25(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 47}{a(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 2} &= -8(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 3 - \\frac{53}{a(-\\frac{11}{6}) - 2} \\\\\n\\frac{24(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 25(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 47}{a(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 2} &= -8(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 3 - \\frac{53}{a(-\\frac{1}{2}) - 2} \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nSimplifying these expressions, we find:\n\n\\begin{align*}\na &= 3 \\\\\na &= -3 \\, .\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince $a$ is a constant, it must satisfy both equations. Therefore, the correct value of $a$ is $-3$, which is choice B.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Simplify the given equation and separate it into two equations for the numerators and denominators.\n2. Solve the quadratic equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula or other methods.\n3. Plug the values of $x$ back into the original equation to find the value of $a$.\n4. Ensure that the found value of $a$ satisfies both the original equation and the simplified numerator equation.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and identify the given information.\n- Simplify the equation and separate it into manageable parts.\n- Solve each part step-by-step, checking your work as you go.\n- Be cautious when dealing with quadratic equations and pay attention to the number of solutions they may have.\n- Always plug your solutions back into the original equation to verify your answer.\n"
