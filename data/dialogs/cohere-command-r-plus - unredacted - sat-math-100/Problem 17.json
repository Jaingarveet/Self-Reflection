However, my mistake was in not recognizing that $4b$ should be simplified to $2a$ before proceeding with the calculation. This incorrect assumption led me to choose answer option B.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic simplification error\n- Cancellation error\n- Assumption error\n\nSolution: \nGiven $\\frac{a}{b} = 2$, we can rewrite this as $a = 2b$. Now, we substitute this expression into the fraction:\n$\\frac{4b}{a} = \\frac{4b}{2b} = \\frac{2a}{a} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 2b}{2b} = \\frac{4b}{2b} = \\frac{2}{1} = C$\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given information: $\\frac{a}{b} = 2$.\n2. Rewrite $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = 2b$.\n3. Substitute this expression into the fraction: $\\frac{4b}{2b}$.\n4. Simplify the fraction: $\\frac{2a}{a}$.\n5. Further simplify by substituting $a = 2b$: $\\frac{2 \\cdot 2b}{2b}$.\n6. Calculate the value: $\\frac{4b}{2b} = \\frac{2}{1}$, which matches choice C.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.\n- Be cautious when canceling out factors; ensure you're not eliminating information that should be used in subsequent steps.\n- Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that fractions can be simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.\n"
