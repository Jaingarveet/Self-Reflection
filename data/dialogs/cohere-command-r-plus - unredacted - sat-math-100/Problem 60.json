If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: \nI incorrectly set up and solved a system of equations. I made a mistake in interpreting the information and applying the mathematical concepts. My error was in the algebraic manipulation and solution process.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Equation error\n- System of equations error\n\nSolution: \nLet $x$ be the number of students in the class. We are given that $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$. \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives: \n$x = 16$. This is incorrect, as it does not satisfy the second equation. \n\nCorrect Solution: \nStarting with the first equation, we can solve for $n$ to find: \n$n = 3x + 5$. \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives: \n$4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + 21$. \n\nSimplifying and solving for $x$: \n$x = 10$, which satisfies both equations. \n\nNow we can find $n$: \n$n = 3x + 5 = 35$. \n\nWith $n$ milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl can give each of the $10$ students $4$ milliliters, with $5$ milliliters left over. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the problem: Mr. Kohl has a fixed amount of solution, and there are two scenarios with different distributions. \n2. Identify the variables: $n$ (amount of solution), $x$ (number of students). \n3. Write the equations: $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + 21$. \n4. Solve for $n$ in the first equation: $n = 3x + 5$. \n5. Substitute and solve: Replace $n$ in the second equation and solve for $x$. \n6. Double-check: Plug $x$ back into both equations to ensure they are satisfied. \n7. Answer: Choose the option that matches the calculated value of $x$. \n\nAdvice: \n - Take the time to understand the problem and identify the relevant variables. \n - Clearly define your variables and equations. \n - Solve one equation at a time, and then substitute to find the final answer. \n - Always double-check your solution by plugging your answer back into the original equations. \n - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and ensure each step is valid.\n"

Substituting this into the second equation, we have $4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + 21$. \n\nSimplifying and solving for $x$, we find $x = 10$, which satisfies both equations.
