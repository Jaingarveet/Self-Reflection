The error occurred when squaring the binomial $(1 + \\sqrt{13})/2$. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Algebraic error\n- Simplification error\n\nSolution: \n\nGiven equations:\n$$\\begin{aligned} y &= x^2 \\\\ 2y + 6 &= 2(x + 3) \\end{aligned}$$\n\nStep 1: Solve for $y$ in the first equation:\n$$y = x^2$$\n\nStep 2: Substitute $y$ into the second equation:\n$$2x^2 + 6 = 2x + 6$$\n\nStep 3: Simplify and rearrange:\n$$x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0$$\n\nStep 4: Use the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-3)}}{2} = \\frac{2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\n\nFor $x > 0$, take the positive root:\n$$x = 1 + \\sqrt{5}$$\n\nStep 5: Substitute $x$ into the equation $y = x^2$:\n$$y = (1 + \\sqrt{5})^2 = (1 + \\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (1 + \\sqrt{5}) = 6 + 2\\sqrt{5}$$\n\nStep 6: Calculate $x y$:\n$$x y = (1 + \\sqrt{5}) \\cdot (6 + 2\\sqrt{5}) = 6 + 12\\sqrt{5} + 5 + 10\\sqrt{5} = 11 + 22\\sqrt{5}$$\n\nStep 7: Simplify further:\n$$x y = 11 + 22 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 11 + 2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot \\sqrt{5} = 11(1 + 2\\sqrt{5}) = 11 \\cdot 3 = \\mathbf{33}$$\n\nSo, $x y = 33$, and the correct choice is **A**.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Solve for $y$ in the first equation.\n2. Substitute $y$ into the second equation.\n3. Simplify and rearrange to get a quadratic equation in $x$.\n4. Use the quadratic formula to find the positive solution for $x$.\n5. Substitute $x$ back into the equation $y = x^2$ to find $y$.\n6. Calculate the product $x y$ by multiplying the values of $x$ and $y$.\n7. Simplify the resulting expression for $x y$ if needed.\n8. Choose the answer choice that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always check your calculations and simplify algebraic expressions carefully.\n- Be cautious when squaring binomials or using the quadratic formula.\n- Double-check your final answer choice before submitting.\n"
