The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\right)$.\nQuestion: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?\nChoices:\n  A: $-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  B: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  C: $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  D: $-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I misinterpreted the question and solved for the exact value of $a$ being $1,000$ instead of finding the value of $t$ that would make $a$ closest to $1,000$. I also made a calculation error in solving for $t$. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Calculation error\n- Approximation error\n\nSolution: We are looking for the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to $1,000$. Let's plug in the given values and solve:\n\n$$1,000=1,052+1.08 t$$\n\nSubtract $1,052$ from both sides:\n\n$$-52=1.08 t$$\n\nDivide both sides by $1.08$ to solve for $t$:\n\n$$t \\approx -48.15$$\n\nGiven the choices, $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$ is the closest value to $-48.15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the relationship between the speed of sound and air temperature.\n2. Recognize that we are looking for an approximate value, not an exact match.\n3. Plug in the given values and solve for $t$.\n4. Compare each answer choice to the calculated value of $t$ and choose the closest match.\n\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the specific values and units provided in the question.\n- Understand the difference between finding an exact match and finding the closest value.\n- Practice solving equations and approximating values.\n- Always double-check your calculations and interpretations.\n"
