I made a mistake in performing the multiplication and did not fully simplify the resulting fraction. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Multiplication error\n- Simplification error\n\nSolution: \n\n$$\\frac{3}{5} w = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nTo solve for $w$, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\\frac{5}{3}$:\n\n$$w = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{20}{9}.$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $w = \\frac{20}{9}$, which is choice D. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the given equation.\n2. Recognize that you need to isolate $w$.\n3. Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient of $w$.\n4. Simplify the resulting expression step-by-step.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result. \n\nAdvice: \n - Always read and understand the given equation. \n - Clearly identify the variable you need to solve for. \n - Know the properties of fractions, including reciprocals and multiplication. \n - Simplify expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. \n - Double-check your final answer and ensure it satisfies the original equation.\n"
