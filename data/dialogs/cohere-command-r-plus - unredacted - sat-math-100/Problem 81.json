I should have substituted $a^2 + b^2$ for $z$ and $ab$ for $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebra error\n- Expansion error\n- Substitution error\n\nSolution: \n\nGiven: $a^{2}+b^{2}=z$ and $ab=y$\n\nWe want to find an expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$:\n\nChoice A: $4(a^2 + b^2) + 8ab = 4z + 8y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)\n\nChoice B: $4(a^2 + b^2) + 4(ab) = 4z + 4y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)\n\nChoice C: $16(a^2 + b^2) + 16(ab) = 16z + 16y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)\n\nChoice D: $16(a^2 + b^2) + 64(ab) = 16z + 64y$ (Substitute $z$ and $y$)\n\nThe correct answer is choice B, which simplifies to $4z + 4y$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the given equations: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.\n2. Understand the task: Find the expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$.\n3. Substitute $z$ and $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms.\n4. Simplify each choice to match the form $4z + 8y$, $4z + 4y$, $16z + 16y$, etc.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the simplified expression.\n\nAdvice:\n\n- Read and understand the question carefully.\n- Identify the given equations and the task at hand.\n- Substitute the given values directly without unnecessary expansion or manipulation.\n- Simplify each choice step-by-step to identify the correct expression.\n- Avoid overcomplicating the problem; sometimes the simplest approach is the best.\n"
