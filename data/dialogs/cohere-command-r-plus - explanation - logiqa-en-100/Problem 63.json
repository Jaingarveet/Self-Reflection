I focused on the expected price increases and residents' need for liquidity, but the correct answer directs attention to the active private lending market and the higher interest rates it offers compared to bank deposits.\n"

This provides a plausible explanation for the outflow of savings funds as residents seek more lucrative returns on their investments.\n\nMy previous response focused on the expected price increases, which is mentioned in option A and is a relevant factor, but it does not fully explain the significant outflow of savings funds.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
