I focused on the date of the cave's inhabitation, ignoring the key point about the number of inhabitants. The correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], refutes the argument's conclusion by suggesting an alternative explanation for the presence of artifacts without disputing the timeline.\n"

This implies that the artifacts may have accumulated over a longer period, and the cave may not have housed a large number of people simultaneously.\n\nReflection: I focused on the variety and amount of artifacts found in the cave, which led me to choose an incorrect answer previously. I overlooked the fact that the argument's conclusion specifically pertains to the number of inhabitants, and the correct answer needed to cast doubt on that specific point.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
