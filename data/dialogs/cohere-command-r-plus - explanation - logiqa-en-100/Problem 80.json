The administration department is on a floor between the planning department and the human resources department (known 3).\n\nNow, we can eliminate some options:\n- Option A can be eliminated because the human resources and sales departments are adjacent, which contradicts known information 1.\n- Option C can be eliminated because the finance and planning departments are not adjacent.\n- Option D can be eliminated because the planning department and finance department are not adjacent, and the administration department is not above the planning department.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. From bottom to top, the floor distribution is: Finance Department, Planning Department, Administration Department, Human Resources Department, Sales Department, R & D Department.\n\nPrevious reflection: I incorrectly assumed that the research and development department must be on the top floor due to the use of \"above\" and \"below\" in known information 3, but this was not a valid assumption as the question only asks for a relative order, not an absolute positioning.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
