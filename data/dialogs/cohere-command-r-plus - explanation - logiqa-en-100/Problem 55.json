(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in front Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: Which of the following lists are acceptable arrangements for the second team's performance?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? H Middle? P After? K\n  B: Before? H Middle? L After? N\n  C: Before? G In? Q After? P\n  D: Before? G In? Q After? N\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted some of the conditions and made assumptions that led me to choose the incorrect answer. \nI incorrectly assumed that conditions (4) and (5) meant that P and N, and P and Q, could not be on the same team, respectively, when in fact, these conditions state that they \"cannot be in the same team as\" each other. \nThis misunderstanding led me to place P on the second team, when in fact, P should not be on the same team as K or Q.\n"
