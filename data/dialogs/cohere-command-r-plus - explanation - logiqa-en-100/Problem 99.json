I focused on the fact that \"customized babies\" had not been tried globally and ignored the part about \"eugenics and the concept of cloning.\" I missed the key distinction between gene screening for defect prevention and the concept of creating \"customized babies.\"\n"

This statement highlights that, despite the potential for \"artificial\" genetic screening to shape the future of human reproduction, natural conception and the laws of nature still play a significant role in the survival of the fittest. This refutes the notion that humans can fully enter an era of \"customized babies\" through technological means alone.\n\nInitially, I answered D, assuming that the untried nature of \"customized babies\" and the ethical concerns surrounding human reproductive technology refuted the notion of \"customized babies.\" However, upon reflection, I realized that choice A provides a more direct critique by challenging the underlying assumption that technology can supersede natural laws and processes.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
