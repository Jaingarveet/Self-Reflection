Statement C does cast some doubt, but it is not the strongest choice as it does not directly challenge the expert's assertion that the bridge must be demolished. Statement B is a stronger choice as it indicates that the problem of large ships not being able to pass may not be as significant as suggested, and that there could be other factors at play, thus raising doubts about the expert's assertion. \n\nThought: Statement B indicates that most international ships do not go beyond the Nanjing Bridge, suggesting that there may be other factors influencing ship traffic and that raising the bridge may not be the only solution. This casts doubt on the expert's assertion that demolition and reconstruction are necessary.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
