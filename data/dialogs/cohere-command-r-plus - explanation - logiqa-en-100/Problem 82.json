This weakens the argument's premise, but doesn't directly address the conclusion.\n\nChoice C states the house is built on rural collective land, which could suggest it has a legal status related to that land, and thus undermines the conclusion that it is not protected by law.\n\nChoice D discusses other houses, not specifically this one, so it doesn't directly weaken the argument about this specific house.\n\nThe correct answer is C as it directly challenges the conclusion by implying a potential legal connection to the land it's built on.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
