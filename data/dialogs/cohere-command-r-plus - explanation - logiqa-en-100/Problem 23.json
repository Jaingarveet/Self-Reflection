This assumption is necessary for the argument's conclusion that the theory is untenable.\n\nThought: \nThe argument assumes that great painters, due to their loneliness and lack of intimate relationships, contradict the psychological theory that happiness stems from such connections. \nChoice A is incorrect as the argument does not discuss the relationship between inner experience and artistic achievement, only the presence or absence of intimate relationships. Choice B is a likely consequence but not an assumption made by the argument. Choice C is the assumption being made; it is necessary for the argument's conclusion that the psychological theory is flawed. Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's assumption, which focuses on relationships, not artistic achievement more broadly.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
