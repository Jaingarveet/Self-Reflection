I focused too narrowly on the statement that both types of cities had similar accident rates, without adequately considering the role of strict drunk driving investigations and their potential impact. The correct answer, \"B,\" highlights that while investigations may be strict in these cities, drunk driving has not been eliminated, which could explain the persistent accident rates. This reflects a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.\n\nThought: \nThe key to resolving the inconsistency is to consider why strict investigations of drunk driving have not led to a noticeable decrease in traffic accidents in certain cities. \nAnswer choice B presents this idea, suggesting that even with strict investigations, drunk driving still occurs and could be a factor in the accident rates. This choice addresses the discrepancy directly and offers a plausible explanation for why the expected reduction in accidents may not have been observed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
