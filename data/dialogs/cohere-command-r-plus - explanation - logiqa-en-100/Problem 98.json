It highlights that while there may be discrepancies between what is legally prohibited or required and what is morally right or wrong, there is often a connection between judgments of right and wrong and underlying rules or standards.\n\nOption C directly supports this argument by stating that behind judgments of right and wrong, there are always rules or standards that people use to make those judgments. This reinforces the idea that rules and standards play a significant role in shaping our moral judgments.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.\n\nMy previous mistake was focusing too narrowly on the idea that rules and judgments are separate entities, neglecting the interplay between them and the broader context of moral relativity and individual conscience.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
