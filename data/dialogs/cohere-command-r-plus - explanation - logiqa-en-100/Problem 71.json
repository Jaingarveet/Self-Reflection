This can be explained by a variety of factors, including personal preferences, financial considerations, and differing views on the benefits of such work for the students. \n\nChoice A suggests that those who are willing to hire college students intend to give them roles that combine tutoring, secretarial work, and/or housekeeping. This doesn't explain the contradiction, as it doesn't address why people are reluctant to hire college students as nannies, and it doesn't provide insight into the preferences of the 60% who said \"no\".\n\nChoice B provides a potential explanation by highlighting a possible discrepancy between the expected salary offered by employers and the expected salary desired by college students seeking nanny positions. This could be a significant factor in understanding the contradiction, as it suggests a misalignment of expectations around compensation, which may deter students from accepting nanny positions.\n\nChoice C sheds light on the differing views of respondents. While a majority believe that housekeeping work would benefit college students, a smaller percentage believe that college student nannies can provide superior housekeeping services. This could explain the contradiction, as people may support the idea conceptually but hesitate to employ college students if they have reservations about the quality of their housekeeping services.\n\nChoice D offers another perspective, suggesting that some people's disapproval stems from their belief that students should focus on opportunities related to their field of study. This could contribute to the contradiction, as it indicates a potential conflict between the perceived benefits of diverse work experience and the desire to maintain a narrow focus on one's major.\n\nTherefore, choices B, C, and D all provide reasonable explanations for the contradictory phenomenon, each highlighting a different aspect that could influence an individual's decision-making process.\n\nAnswer: B, C, and D.\nAction: Answer(\"B, C, D\")"
