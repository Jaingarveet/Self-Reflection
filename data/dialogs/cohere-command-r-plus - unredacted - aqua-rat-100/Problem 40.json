How much money did John have ?\nChoices:\n  A: 22\n  B: 60\n  C: 28\n  D: 26\n  E: 18\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I made an error in interpreting the information given in the question and set up the equations incorrectly. I should have considered the transactions from each person's perspective and used consistent variables for each step of the calculation. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Equation setup error\n- Interpretation error\n- Inconsistent variable usage\n\nSolution: \n\nLet's assume John has x amount of money. \n\nAccording to Mark, if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, from Mark's perspective: \nJohn's contribution = 1/2 * x\nMark already had: 75 - (1/2)x\n\nAccording to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs. 75. So, from John's perspective: \nJohn's original amount + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75\nThis can be written as: x + (1/3)(2x - 75) = 75\n\nNow, we can solve for x: \n75 = x + (2/3)x - 25\n75 = (5/3)x - 25\n100 = (5/3)x\nx = 60\n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the variables: let John's money = x\n2. Interpret Mark's statement: from Mark's perspective, after receiving half of John's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's contribution + Mark's original money = Rs. 75\n3. Interpret John's statement: from John's perspective, after receiving one-third of Mark's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's original money + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75\n4. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation\n5. Plug the value of x back into the equations to find Mark's original money\n6. Calculate the answer choices to check which one matches our calculated amount\n\nAdvice: \n - Always read and interpret the information given in the question carefully. \n - Use consistent and clear variables for each person or object involved in the problem. \n - Set up equations based on the perspective of each person or object involved. \n - Double-check your equations and calculations to ensure they align with the information given in the question. \n - Solve one step at a time and regularly check your work to catch errors early on.\n"
