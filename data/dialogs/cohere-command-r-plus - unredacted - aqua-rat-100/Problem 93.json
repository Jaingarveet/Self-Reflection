The error occurred when I simplified the expression without considering the order of operations, specifically the division by 19. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Mathematical error\n- Order of operations error\n- Simplification error\n\nSolution: Step-by-step calculation:\n1. [5 + X × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13^2 - 156] = 6\n2. X × 19 = 15 + 7 - 5 = 17\n3. X = 17/19\n4. [5 + 17/19 × 19 - 15 - 7]/[169 - 156] = 6\n5. Simplify inside the brackets first: [217/19 - 15 - 7]/[12] = 6\n6. Continue calculation inside the brackets: [11.42 - 15 - 7]/[12] = 6\n7. Calculate the numerator: [-3.58 - 7]/[12] = 6\n8. Calculate the numerator: [-10.58]/[12] = 6\n9. Divide: -10.58/12 = -0.881666 = 6\n\nThe equation does not hold true, so the correct answer is \"C: There is no such value of X.\"\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given equation and the values to be calculated.\n2. Simplify the equation step-by-step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n3. Calculate the value of X accurately, ensuring correct division.\n4. Plug the value of X back into the original equation and simplify.\n5. Check if the equation holds true when both sides are equal to 6.\n6. If the equation holds true, choose the appropriate answer option; otherwise, select \"no such value.\"\n\nAdvice:\n- Always follow the correct order of operations to avoid errors in simplification.\n- Pay attention to fractions and divisions; ensure you perform calculations accurately.\n- Double-check your calculations and the final answer.\n- Read the question and answer options carefully to understand the task fully.\n"
