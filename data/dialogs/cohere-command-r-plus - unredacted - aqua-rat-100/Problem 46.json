His monthly income is ?\nChoices:\n  A: Rs. 4400\n  B: Rs. 4270\n  C: Rs. 4000\n  D: Rs. 3937.50\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I incorrectly set up the equation to find the man's monthly income. I added his savings to his expenses instead of subtracting them, which led to my incorrect choice of answer \"A.\" \n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Equation setup error\n- Sign error\n\nSolution: \nLet's call the man's monthly income 'x'. \nHe saves 12.5% of 'x', which is 0.125x, and this amount is not spent. So, his expenses are Rs. 3500, and his income is x. \n\nWe can set up the equation: \nx - 0.125x = Rs. 3500 \n\nNow, simply solve for x: \n0.875x = Rs. 3500 \nx = Rs. 3500 / 0.875 \nx = Rs. 4000 \n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and what needs to be solved. \n2. Define variables: Let 'x' represent the man's monthly income. \n3. Set up the equation: Subtract his savings (12.5% of income) from his income to get expenses. \n4. Solve the equation: Isolate 'x' to find the value of monthly income. \n5. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches your calculated result. \n\nAdvice: \n - Always read the question carefully to identify the correct variables and their relationships. \n - Pay attention to signs and directions (addition, subtraction, etc.). \n - Double-check your equation setup and ensure it aligns with the problem's logic. \n - Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding and accuracy. \n - Remember that savings are subtracted from income, not added to expenses.\n"
