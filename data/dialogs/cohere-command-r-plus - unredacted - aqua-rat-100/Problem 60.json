If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?\nChoices:\n  A: 80°\n  B: 130°\n  C: 140°\n  D: 160°\n  E: 220°\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I made a calculation error in finding the measure of minor arc BD and then propagating that error to the final answer. I subtracted the values of minor arcs AB and BC from minor arc BD, instead of correctly calculating their sum. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Sign error\n- Subtraction error\n\nSolution: \nGiven that B bisects minor arc AC, minor arc AB = minor arc BC = 80° (as minor arc AC is 160°). \nTo find minor arc BD: \nminor arc BD = minor arc AB + minor arc BC \nminor arc BD = 80° + 80° \nminor arc BD = 160°. \n\nNow, to find minor arc AD: \nminor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BD \nminor arc AD = 80° + 160° \nminor arc AD = 240°. \n\nThe measure of minor arc AD is 240°, which is greater than 180° (half the circle). This indicates that minor arc AD is actually a major arc, and its measure as a minor arc is the complementary angle, which is 180° - 240° = 40°. \n\nSo, minor arc AD = 40°. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the given values for minor arcs AC, BD, and the bisected minor arc AB (and BC). \n2. Calculate the measure of minor arc BD by adding the measures of minor arcs AB and BC. \n3. Find the measure of minor arc AD by adding the measures of minor arcs AB and BD. \n4. Check if the measure of minor arc AD is greater than half the circle's circumference (180°). \n5. If it is greater, subtract the measure from 180° to find the complementary angle, which represents the minor arc AD. \n\nAdvice: \n - Read the question carefully and identify the given geometric relationships and values. \n - Draw a diagram if needed to visualize the problem. \n - Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring you apply the correct geometric rules and formulas. \n - Double-check your calculations and the final answer, considering any special cases or constraints. \n - Remember that when an arc bisects another, their measures are equal, and the sum of their measures equals the measure of the whole arc.\n"

So, minor arc AD is actually a major arc. To find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to subtract its measure from 360° (the full circle):\nminor arc AD = 360° - 240°\nminor arc AD = 120°.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 120°, which is not among the provided choices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
