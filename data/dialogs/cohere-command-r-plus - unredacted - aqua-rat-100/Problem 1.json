        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?\nChoices:\n  A:  13.3542\n  B:  15.8113\n  C:  18.3451\n  D:  19.5667\n  E:  20.8888\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I applied the Pythagorean theorem correctly but made a calculation error in simplifying the square root of 250. I should have calculated $\\sqrt{250} = 5\\sqrt{10} \\approx 15.81$, which is answer choice B. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Simplification error\n- Estimation error\n\nSolution: The rectangular solid has dimensions $3, 4$, and $15$. The diameter of the sphere is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\n$$\\text{diameter} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{118} \\approx 10.87$$\n\nThe correct answer is choice B, approximately $15.81$.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the relevant formula: the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonal of a rectangular solid.\n2. Plug the dimensions into the formula: $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$, where $a, b$, and $c$ are the sides of the rectangular solid.\n3. Simplify the square root: $\\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \\sqrt{118}$.\n4. Calculate the square root: $\\sqrt{118} \\approx 10.87$.\n5. Choose the answer choice that matches the calculated value.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always double-check your calculations, especially when simplifying square roots.\n- Practice estimating numerical expressions to identify when a calculated value is unreasonable.\n- Be familiar with common square roots and their approximate values.\n- Use a calculator for complex calculations to reduce the chance of errors.\n"
