It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\nChoices:\n  A: 438\n  B: 550\n  C: 500\n  D: 450\n  E: 498\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I made a calculation error in determining the number of smaller cubes and their unpainted faces. I correctly identified the number of smaller cubes in each direction as 3, but I incorrectly calculated the total number of smaller cubes and their unpainted faces. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Counting error\n- Underestimation\n\nSolution: The hollow cube consists of $5^3 = 125$ smaller cubes. Out of these, the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which are $3^3 = 27$ in total, will have some faces painted. Each of these outer smaller cubes has 5 unpainted faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is $27 \\times 5 = 135$. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Calculate the total number of smaller cubes within the hollow cube. \n2. Determine the number of smaller cubes on each face of the hollow cube that will have one face painted. \n3. Calculate the number of unpainted faces for each smaller cube on the outer surface. \n4. Find the total number of unpainted faces by multiplying the number of outer smaller cubes by the number of their unpainted faces. \n\nAdvice: \n - Pay close attention to the dimensions and sizes provided in the question. \n - Carefully count the number of elements involved, especially when dealing with three-dimensional shapes. \n - Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem. \n - Consider all relevant faces or elements that may contribute to the final count.\n"

So, the total unpainted faces on edge cubes are $48 \\times 3 = 144$. \n\nAt each corner, there is 1 smaller cube, and each of them has only one unpainted face. So, the total unpainted faces on corner cubes are $8 \\times 1 = 8$. \n\nThe total number of unpainted faces is now calculated as $810 - 144 - 8 = \\boxed{658}$. \n\nThis value is not among the given choices, so the answer must be choice E, the closest value to 658.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
