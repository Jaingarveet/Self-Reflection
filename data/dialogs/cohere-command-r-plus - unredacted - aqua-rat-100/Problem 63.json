What was the number of matches that the team lost?\nChoices:\n  A: 70\n  B: 30\n  C: 3\n  D: 7\n  E: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the question and calculated the answer incorrectly. \nI calculated 30% of 20, but the correct approach was to calculate the total number of matches and then find 30% of that number. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Calculation error\n- Percentage error\n\nSolution: \nThe team won 20 matches, so they played a total of 100% * 20 matches = 100 matches. \n30% of 100 matches is 0.30 * 100 = 30 matches lost. \nTherefore, the team lost 30 matches, and the correct answer is C.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to understand the given information.\n2. Identify the number of matches won and interpret \"30% of their matches\" as \"30% of the total matches played.\"\n3. Calculate the total number of matches played by the team.\n4. Calculate the number of matches lost by multiplying the total number of matches by 0.30.\n5. Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and clarify the meaning of each statement.\n- Understand the difference between \"30% of X\" and \"30% of the total,\" and be mindful of such nuances in the questions.\n- Calculate percentages accurately and practice common percentage calculations to improve your speed and accuracy.\n"
