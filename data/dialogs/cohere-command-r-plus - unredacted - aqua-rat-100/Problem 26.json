        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?\nChoices:\n  A: 9\n  B: 11\n  C: 22\n  D: 25\n  E: 31\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: \nI incorrectly applied the square root to find the side length of the square. I should have divided the total area of the rectangle by the length of the side of the square, not taken the square root of the area. This is a common mistake when dealing with geometric transformations and area calculations.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Geometric transformation error\n- Area calculation error\n- Square root error\n\nSolution: \nThe total area of the rectangle is 27 cm x 17 cm = 459 sq. cm. When the rectangle is rebent into a square, the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the square is also 459 sq. cm. \n\nTo find the length of one side of the square, we divide the area by the length of one side: \n459 sq. cm / side = side^2\n\nside^2 = 459\nside = √459 ≈ 21.4 cm\n\nSince we need an integer side length, we round down to the nearest integer: 21 cm.\n\nInstructions: \n1. Calculate the area of the rectangle (length x breadth). \n2. Recognize that the area of the rectangle and the square are equal since it is the same wire rebent. \n3. Set up the equation: area of the square = side x side. \n4. Divide the total area by the length of one side to find the side length. \n5. Check your calculations and ensure you have not taken the square root. \n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result. \n\nAdvice: \n- Understand the properties of geometric shapes and how they transform. \n- Pay attention to the units in the problem and ensure they are consistent throughout your calculations. \n- Be careful with square roots and exponents; they are easily confused. \n- Double-check your calculations and ensure you are solving for the correct variable.\n"
