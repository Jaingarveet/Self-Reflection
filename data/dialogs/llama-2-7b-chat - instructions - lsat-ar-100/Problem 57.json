Let me break down the conditions step by step:\n\n1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days - Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n2. Exactly two reports will be given each day - one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.\n4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.\n5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let me apply these conditions to the choices given in the question:\n\nA: George and Lenore - Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Lenore is not one of the six students who will give reports, they cannot give reports on the same day. Therefore, they must give reports on Wednesday. [REDACTED]\n\nB: Helen and Nina - Since Nina can give a report on any day except Wednesday, and Helen is one of the six students who will give reports, they must give reports on the same day. Therefore, they must give reports on Wednesday. [REDACTED]\n\nC: Irving and Robert - Since neither of them can give an afternoon report, and they are both among the six students who will give reports, they must give reports on the same day. Therefore, they must give reports on Wednesday. [REDACTED]\n\nD: Kyle and Nina - Since Kyle is not one of the six students who will give reports, and Nina can give a report on any day except Wednesday, they cannot give reports on the same day. Therefore, they must give reports on Wednesday. [REDACTED]\n\nE: Olivia and Kyle - Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, and Kyle is not one of the six students who will give reports, they cannot give reports on the same day. Therefore, they must give reports on Wednesday. [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday is:\n\nB: Helen and Nina\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
