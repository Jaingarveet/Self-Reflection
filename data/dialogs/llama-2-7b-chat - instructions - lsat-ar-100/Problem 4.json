Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nFrom these constraints, I can deduce the following:\n\n* If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Kevin must lead a Thursday session ( constraint 1).\n* If Kevin leads a Thursday session, then Olivia must lead a Friday session ( constraint 2).\n* If Olivia leads a Friday session, then Nessa must lead an afternoon session ( constraint 3).\n* If Julio's session meets on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, then it must meet on Wednesday ( constraint 4).\n\nBased on these deductions, the correct answer is (B) Olivia.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
