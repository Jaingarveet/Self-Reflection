The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer must select at least three but no more than four novels, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\n\nI realized that the correct answer is (D) Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected.\n\nReflection: I made a mistake in my initial answer by not considering the constraints of the problem. I should have paid closer attention to the requirements given in the problem, especially the part that states \"If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\" This means that the organizer cannot select both French plays, so the number of French novels selected must be at least two. Additionally, the number of Russian novels selected must be at least as many as the number of French novels selected, which is two in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected."
