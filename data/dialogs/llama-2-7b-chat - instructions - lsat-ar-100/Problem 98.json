Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct answer.\n\nThe rules given in the problem are:\n\n1. J must be shown in the evening.\n2. K cannot be shown in the morning.\n3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n\nFrom the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. J is shown in the evening, so K, L, M, N, O, and P are shown during the day.\n2. K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so it cannot be shown in the morning or in the afternoon before K is shown.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the choices:\n\nA: K is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis is possible, as K can be shown in the afternoon or evening after J is shown in the evening.\n\nB: L is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis is possible, as L can be shown in the afternoon or evening after J is shown in the evening.\n\nC: P is shown at some time after J is shown.\nThis is not possible, as P cannot be shown in the afternoon or evening after J is shown in the evening.\n\nD: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown.\nThis is not possible, as M must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and N and O cannot be shown in the afternoon or evening after M is shown.\n\nE: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.\nThis is not possible, as K must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and N and P cannot be shown in the afternoon or evening after K is shown.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) K is shown at some time after J is shown."
