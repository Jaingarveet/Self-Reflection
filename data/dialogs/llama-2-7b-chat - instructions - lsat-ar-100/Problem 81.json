The organizer's selection of works must conform to the given requirements, which means that no more than four French works can be selected, and at least three but no more than four novels must be selected. Additionally, if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nI reflected on my previous answer and realized that I misunderstood the requirements of the problem. I mistakenly selected option A, which states that no Russian novels are selected. However, the problem states that at least three but no more than four novels must be selected, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, option D, which states that all three Russian novels are selected, is the correct answer."
