Here is my self-reflection:\n\n* I misunderstood the condition that states that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. I thought that Parra and Tiao could both work in Zone 1, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.\n* I also misunderstood the condition that states that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. I thought that Tiao and Udall could both work in Zone 2, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.\n* I did not consider the condition that states that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is crucial in determining the correct matching of sales representatives to sales zones.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I will use the following reasoning:\n\n* Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in Zone 1.\n* Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in Zone 3.\n* There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Mahr must work in Zone 3.\n* Therefore, the correct matching of sales representatives to sales zones is:\n\nZone 1: Kim, Parra, Quinn\nZone 2: Stuckey, Udall\nZone 3: Mahr\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
