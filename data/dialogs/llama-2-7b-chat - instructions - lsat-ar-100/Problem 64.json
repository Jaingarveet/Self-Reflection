Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nAction: Based on these conditions, I can conclude that Mahr and Stuckey do not work in the same sales zone. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n\nReflection: I made a mistake in my initial answer, but I was able to identify the error and correct it through careful analysis of the conditions given in the question. This shows the importance of self-reflection in problem-solving and the value of carefully reviewing and analyzing information before making a decision."
