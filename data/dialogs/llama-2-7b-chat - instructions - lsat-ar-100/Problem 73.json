The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

Upon further reflection, I realized that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so they cannot review Undulation. Additionally, I correctly identified that Jiang and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, which means that Lopez and Megregian do not review any of the plays that Jiang reviews, including Undulation."
