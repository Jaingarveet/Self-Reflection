Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\n\nProblem:\nThe problem states that exactly one of three breeds of kitten and exactly one of three breeds of puppy are featured in the pet shop on each of exactly seven consecutive days. The conditions are:\n\n* Greyhounds are featured on day 1.\n* No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\n* Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.\n* Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.\n* Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nSolution:\nI initially thought that the order of the breeds of kitten could be A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese. However, this is incorrect because Himalayans are featured on day 1, which means that they cannot be featured on day 7.\n\nCorrect Answer:\nThe correct order of the breeds of kitten is D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese.\n\nExplanation:\nThe order of the breeds of kitten is D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese. This order satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. On day 1, Greyhounds are featured, so no breed is featured. On day 2, Himalayans are featured, but no breed is featured on day 1, so this is allowed. On day 3, Siamese are featured, and on day 4, Himalayans are featured again. On day 5, Manx are featured, and on day 6, Himalayans are featured again. Finally, on day 7, Siamese are featured.\n\n[REDACTED]"
