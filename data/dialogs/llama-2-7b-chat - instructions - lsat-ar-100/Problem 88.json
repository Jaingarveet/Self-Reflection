Here is my self-reflection:\n\n* I misunderstood the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I thought the condition was that more books are placed on the top shelf than the bottom shelf, which led me to choose the wrong answer.\n* I also misunderstood the placement of the book K. I thought it was placed on a lower shelf than F, but it is actually placed on a higher shelf than F.\n* I did not consider the placement of the book O correctly. I thought it was placed on the same shelf as L, but it is actually placed on a higher shelf than L.\n\nBased on my reflection, the correct answer is (D) M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
