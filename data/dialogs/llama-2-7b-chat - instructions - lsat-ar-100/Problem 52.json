Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\nAction: I will use the information provided in the question to create a schedule for the five witnesses.\n\nMonday:\n\n* Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Franco must testify on Monday.\n* Hong does not testify on Monday, so at least one witness must testify on Monday.\n\nTuesday:\n\n* Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Garcia and either Iturbe or Jackson must testify on Tuesday.\n\nWednesday:\n\n* Jackson testifies on Wednesday, so the only witness that can testify on Wednesday is Iturbe.\n\nReflection: Based on the schedule I created, the correct answer is (C) Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n\nExplanation: Franco testifies on Monday, and Hong does not testify on Monday, so exactly one witness must testify on Monday. Garcia and Jackson testify on Tuesday, and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so the schedule meets the conditions of the problem."
