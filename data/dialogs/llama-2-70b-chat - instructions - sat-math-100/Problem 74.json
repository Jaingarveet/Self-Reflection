Factor the expression $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}}$:\n\nWe can start by factoring the denominator:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+3}$$\n\nNow we can simplify:\n\n$$\\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+3} = \\frac{x+2}{x+3}$$\n\nSo, the resulting expression is $\\frac{x+2}{x+3}$.\n\n2. Compare the resulting expression with the given choices:\n\nA: $\\frac{2 x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}$\n\nB: $\\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$\n\nC: $2 x+5$\n\nD: $x^{2}+5 x+6$\n\nWe can see that the resulting expression $\\frac{x+2}{x+3}$ is not identical to any of the given choices. However, we can simplify it further:\n\n$$\\frac{x+2}{x+3} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{x+2}{x+3} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x+2}}$$\n\nNow we can compare it with choice B:\n\n$$\\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5} = \\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{x+2}{2 x+5} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x+2}}$$\n\nWe can see that $\\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x+2}}} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{x+2}}}$, so the resulting expression is equivalent to choice B.\n\n3. Choose the option that is equivalent to the resulting expression:\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: $\\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
