        "content": "  Sure, I'll be happy to help. Here's how I'd approach the problem:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem:\nThe problem states that the population of City X increased by 20% and the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. The population of City X in 2010 was 120,000. We need to find the population of City Y in 2010.\n2. Write down the correct equation based on the information given:\nLet PX represent the population of City X andPY represent the population of City Y.\nWe know that PX in 2010 was 120,000, so PX(2010) = 120,000.\nWe also know that PX increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015, so PX(2015) = 120,000 x 1.20 = 144,000.\nWe know that PY decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015, so PY(2015) = PY(2010) x 0.90.\nWe can set up the equation:\nPX(2015) = PY(2010)\n144,000 = PY(2010) x 0.90\n3. Solve for the variable (Y) in the equation:\nWe can divide both sides of the equation by 0.90 to get:\n144,000 / 0.90 = PY(2010)\n160,000 = PY(2010)\n4. Calculate the population of City Y in 2010:\nWe have found that PY(2010) = 160,000.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result:\nThe answer is C: 160,000.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
