I misunderstood the expression $\\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - 4$. I thought it was equal to $9x - 6$, but it's actually equal to $3x - 2$.\n\nNow, let's solve the question:\n\n1. Simplify the given equation:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - 4 = 9x - 6$$\n\nWe can simplify the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) = 6x - 4$$\n\nNow, we can equate the two sides:\n\n$$6x - 4 = 9x - 6$$\n\n2. Solve for x:\n\nWe can add 4 to both sides:\n\n$$6x = 9x - 2$$\n\nSubtract 9x from both sides:\n\n$$-3x = -2$$\n\nDivide both sides by -3:\n\n$$x = \\frac{-2}{-3}$$\n\nx = $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\n3. Substitute the value of x into the expression for $3x - 2$:\n\n$$3x - 2 = 3(\\frac{2}{3}) - 2 = \\frac{4}{3} - 2 = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nSo, the value of $3x - 2$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
