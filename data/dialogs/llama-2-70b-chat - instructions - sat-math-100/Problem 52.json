Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the variables.\nKatarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did.\n\nVariables:\n\n* Type A trees\n* Type B trees\n* pears\n\n2. Use the correct variables in your calculation.\nWe know that Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees. So, if Type B trees produced x pears, Type A trees produced x + (20% of x) pears.\n\nWe are given that Type A trees produced 144 pears. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (20% of x) = 144\n\n3. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.\nFirst, let's calculate 20% of x:\n\n20% of x = 0.2x\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the equation:\n\nx + 0.2x = 144\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1.2x = 144\n\nDivide both sides by 1.2:\n\nx = 120\n\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nThe answer is B: 120.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
