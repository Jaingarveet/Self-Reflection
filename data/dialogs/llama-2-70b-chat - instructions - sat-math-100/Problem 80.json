After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake in step 3 of my solution. Specifically, I incorrectly solved for $k$.\n\nTo solve for $k$, I should have set the two equations equal to each other, subtracted $4x$ from both sides, and then solved for $k$. This would have given me the correct solution of $k = \\frac{16}{7}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: $\\frac{16}{7}$."
