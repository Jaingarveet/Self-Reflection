        "content": "  Sure, I'll be happy to help! Here's how to solve the problem:\n\nStep 1: Isolate x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation.\n\n0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)\n0.10x + 0.20y - 0.20y = 0.18x + 0.18y\n0.10x = 0.18x - 0.02y\n\nStep 2: Substitute y = 100 into the equation.\n\n0.10x = 0.18(100) - 0.02(100)\n0.10x = 18 - 2\n0.10x = 16\n\nStep 3: Simplify the equation to solve for x.\n\n0.10x = 16\nx = 16/0.10\nx = 160\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 50.\n\nI hope this helps!
