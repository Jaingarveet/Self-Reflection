Substituting $a$ as a nonzero constant and $b=0$, we get $y=a(x-2)(x+4)$.\n3. The vertex is found by setting the first factor equal to zero: $x-2=0$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x=2$.\nSubstituting $x=2$ into the original equation, we get $y=a(2-2)(2+4)=a(0)(6)=0$.\nSo, the vertex is $(2, 0)$.\n4. To find $d$, we need to find the y-coordinate of the vertex.\nSince the vertex is $(2, 0)$, $d=0$.\n5. Double-checking, we can plug in $x=2$ into the original equation:\n$y=a(2-2)(2+4)=a(0)(6)=0$.\nSo, $d=0$ is correct.\n6. Therefore, the answer is C: $-5 a$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
