Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?\nChoices:\n  A: 3\n  B: $\\quad 5.7$\n  C: 9.5\n  D: 14.3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the equation that represents the relationship between the boy's height and age.\nAction: The equation that represents the relationship between the boy's height and age is $$h=3 a+28.6$$\n2. Choose two values for the age, a, and substitute them into the equation to find the corresponding heights.\nAction: Let's choose $a=2$ and $a=5$.\nSubstituting $a=2$ into the equation, we get $$h=3(2)+28.6=62.6$$\nSubstituting $a=5$ into the equation, we get $$h=3(5)+28.6=112.6$$\n3. [REDACTED]. Calculate the slope of the line by finding the difference in heights and dividing it by the difference in ages.\nAction: The difference in heights is $112.6-62.6=50$\nThe difference in ages is $5-2=3$\nThe slope is $50/3=16.7$\n4. Interpret the slope as the estimated increase in height each year.\nAction: The slope $16.7$ means that the boy's height increases by approximately $16.7$ inches each year.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: $\\quad 5.7$\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question and didn't pay attention to the units of the variables. I reflected on my mistake and realized that I needed to find the slope of the line to get the estimated increase in height each year. This time, I carefully followed the instructions and found the correct answer."
