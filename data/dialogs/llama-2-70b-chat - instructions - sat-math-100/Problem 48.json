Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\n\nThe first equation can be solved for x as follows:\n\n$$x = \\frac{5x - 7}{3} = \\frac{5(x - 1) - 7}{3} = x - \\frac{7}{3}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for x into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$3y + c = 5(x - \\frac{7}{3}) - 7$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for y, we have:\n\n$$y = \\frac{5x - 21}{12}$$\n\nNow, substituting the expression for y into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$3x + b = 5\\left(\\frac{5x - 21}{12}\\right) - 7$$\n\nSimplifying and solving for b, we have:\n\n$$b = c - \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nTherefore, the relationship between b and c is that b is equal to c minus $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nHence, the correct answer is option A: $x$ is $y$ minus $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
