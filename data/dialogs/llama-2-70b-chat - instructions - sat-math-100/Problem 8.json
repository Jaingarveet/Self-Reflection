The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. The goal is to find the original price of the computer in terms of $p$.\n\nKnown variables and their values:\n\n* $p$: the total amount Alma paid to the cashier, including the sales tax\n* 20%: the discount given by the store\n* 8%: the sales tax rate\n\nEquation for the original price of the laptop:\n\nLet $x$ be the original price of the laptop before the discount.\nThe discounted price = $x$ - (20% of $x$) = $x$ - $\\frac{x}{5}$ = $\\frac{4x}{5}$\n\nThe total amount Alma paid = discounted price + sales tax\n= $\\frac{4x}{5}$ + $\\frac{4x}{5}$(8%)\n= $\\frac{4x}{5}$ + $\\frac{0.32x}{5}$\n= $\\frac{4.32x}{5}$\n\nSince Alma paid $p$ dollars, we can set up the equation:\n\n$\\frac{4.32x}{5}$ = $p$\n\nTo find $x$, we can multiply both sides by 5:\n\n$4.32x$ = $5p$\n\n$x$ = $\\frac{5p}{4.32}$\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\n$x$ = $\\frac{5p}{4.32}$\n\n= $\\frac{5(0.8)p}{4.32}$\n\n= $\\frac{4p}{3.2}$\n\n= $\\frac{p}{0.8}$\n\nTherefore, the original price of the laptop is $\\frac{p}{0.8}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
