        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the wrong value for m.\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how many fewer miles Alan needs to drive to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. We know that Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week and that his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. We also know that gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon.\nLet's first calculate how much Alan spends on gasoline per week:\n100 miles/week $\\times$ 25 miles/gallon $\\times$ 4 dollars/gallon = 1000 dollars/week\nNow, we need to find out how many miles Alan needs to reduce his weekly driving distance to save $\\$ 5$ on gasoline. We can do this by dividing the weekly savings by the cost per mile:\n5 dollars/week $\\div$ 4 dollars/gallon $\\div$ 25 miles/gallon = 0.05 miles/week\nSince we want to reduce the number of miles Alan drives, we'll subtract this value from his current weekly driving distance:\n100 miles/week - 0.05 miles/week = 99.95 miles/week\nSo, Alan needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 0.05 miles to save $\\$ 5$ on gasoline.\nNow, let's check the answer choices:\nChoice A: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\nThis equation is not relevant to the problem.\nChoice B: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\nThis equation is not relevant to the problem.\nChoice C: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\nThis equation is not relevant to the problem.\nChoice D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nThis is the correct equation.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
