I misunderstood the formula for the equation of a circle and wrote the equation of a parabola instead.\nThe correct formula for the equation of a circle with center $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ is:\n$$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$$\nGiven the center $(0, 4)$ and the radius with endpoint $\\left(\\frac{4}{3}, 5\\right)$, we can substitute these values into the formula:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n(x-0)^2 + (y-4)^2 &= \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^2 + 5^2 \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 - 8x + 8y - 16 &= \\frac{16}{9} + 25 \\\\\nx^2 + y^2 - 8x + 8y - 11 &= 0\n\\end{aligned}$$\nNow we can simplify the equation:\n$$x^2 + y^2 - 8x + 8y - 11 = 0$$\nComparing this equation with the given choices, we see that it matches choice A:\n$$x^2 + (y-4)^2 = \\frac{25}{9}$$\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
