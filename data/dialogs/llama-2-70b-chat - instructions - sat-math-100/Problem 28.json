Rearrange the equation to isolate x:\n\n$$\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}=-2$$\n\n$$x^{2}-1=-2(x-1)$$\n\n2. Expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n$$x^{2}-1=-2x+2$$\n\n3. Factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n\n$$(x-1)(x+1)=0$$\n\n4. Solve for x in each possible case:\n\nCase 1: x-1=0\n\nx=1\n\nCase 2: x+1=0\n\nx=-1\n\n5. List all values of x that satisfy the equation:\n\nx=1, x=-1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: -3 and -1.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
