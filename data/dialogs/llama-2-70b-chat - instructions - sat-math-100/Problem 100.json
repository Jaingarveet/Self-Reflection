I misunderstood the formula and wrote the equation as $a = 1.08t$ instead of $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$.\n\nTo find the air temperature that will result in a speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to find the value of $t$ that will make $a$ closest to 1,000.\n\nThe correct order of magnitude for $t$ is degrees Fahrenheit, and we can see that the given choices are all negative temperatures. Therefore, we need to find the smallest negative temperature that will result in a value of $a$ closest to 1,000.\n\nLet's calculate the value of $a$ for each choice:\n\nA: $-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$a = 1,052 + 1.08(-46) = 966$\n\nB: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$a = 1,052 + 1.08(-48) = 944$\n\nC: $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$a = 1,052 + 1.08(-49) = 931$\n\nD: $-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n$a = 1,052 + 1.08(-50) = 919$\n\nWe can see that choice C, $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$, results in a value of $a$ closest to 1,000, which is $931$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
