Substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:\n\n2.4 x - 1.5(1.6 x + 0.5 y) = 0.3\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n2.4 x - 2.4 x + 0.8 y = 0.3\n-0.8 y = -2.1\n\n3. Solving for y:\n\ny = -2.1/0.8 = -2.625\n\n4. Substituting y into one of the original equations, say equation (1):\n\n2.4 x - 1.5(-2.625) = 0.3\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n2.4 x + 4.125 = 0.3\n\n5. Solving for x:\n\nx = -4.125/2.4 = -1.71875\n\n6. The x-coordinate of the intersection point is -1.71875.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
