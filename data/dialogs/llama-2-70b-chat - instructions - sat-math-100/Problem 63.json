Solve for the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.\n5. Check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.\nAction: Reflect on your previous answer and explain what you did wrong.\nReflection: I previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing option A. My reasoning was that the initial payment of $\\$ 60$ should be subtracted from the total cost of the television, and the remaining amount should be paid in weekly installments of $\\$ 30$. However, I realized that this approach was incorrect because it didn't take into account the fact that the initial payment is already part of the total cost of the television.\nThe correct approach is to use option B, which states that the total cost of the television is equal to the weekly payments times the number of weekly payments.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nEquation for the total cost of the television:\n$T = 300$\n\nRepresent the weekly payment and initial payment:\n$W = 30$\n$I = 60$\n\nEquation that represents the total amount paid so far:\n$P = W \\times N$\n\nwhere $N$ is the number of weekly payments made so far.\n\nSolve for the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase:\n$N = \\frac{T - I}{W}$\n\nSubstituting the values given in the problem:\n$N = \\frac{300 - 60}{30}$\n$N = 10$\n\nCheck your answer by plugging it into the original equation:\n$T = W \\times N$\n$300 = 30 \\times 10$\n$300 = 300$\n\nThis shows that the answer is correct. The number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase of the television is 10."
