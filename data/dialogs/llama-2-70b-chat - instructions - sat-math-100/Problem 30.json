The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.\n  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.\n  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1. Analyze the supply function $S(P)$ and identify the coefficient of $P$.\n2. Calculate the increase in the quantity supplied by multiplying the coefficient of $P$ by the increase in price ($10$).\n3. Choose the answer that matches the calculated increase in quantity supplied.\n"

I misunderstood the question and calculated the increase in the quantity demanded instead of the quantity supplied.\n\nThe supply function $S(P)$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2} P+40$. The coefficient of $P$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTo calculate the increase in the quantity supplied, I need to multiply the coefficient of $P$ by the increase in price, which is $10$. Therefore, the increase in the quantity supplied is:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5$$\n\nSo, the quantity supplied will increase by $5$ units.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
