Expand the given expression: $(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$\n2. Substitute $a+b=8$ into the expression: $a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$\n3. Equate the coefficients of the two expressions: $a b = 15$, $2 b = c$\n4. Solve for $a$ and $b$: $a = 5$, $b = 3$\n5. Determine the two possible values for $c$: $c = 2 \\times 3 = 6$, $c = 5 \\times 3 = 15$\n6. Choose the correct answer: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n"
