I misunderstood the question and calculated the probability of a tablet user answering \"Always\" given that they did not answer \"Rarely\" instead of given that they did not answer \"Never.\" I also failed to check my answer against the given choices.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\nP(B|A) = P(A|B) \\* P(B) / P(A)\n\nIn this case, A is \"Always\" and B is \"Not Never.\"\n\nP(A|B) = 0.309 (from the table)\nP(B) = 0.687 (from the table)\nP(A) = 0.313 (from the table)\n\nNow, let's calculate P(B|A):\nP(B|A) = P(A|B) \\* P(B) / P(A)\n= 0.309 \\* 0.687 / 0.313\n= 0.690\n\nNow, I can compare the calculated probability, 0.690, to the given choices:\n\nA: 0.31 (too low)\nB: 0.38 (too low)\nC: 0.45 (too high)\nD: 0.69 (correct)\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is D: 0.69.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
