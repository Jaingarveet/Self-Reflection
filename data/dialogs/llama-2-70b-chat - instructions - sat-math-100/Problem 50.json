There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female?

I misunderstood the information given in the problem and wrote down the wrong equations.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given information:\n\n* There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students.\n* There are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students.\n* There are 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in total.\n\nNow, let's identify the variables:\n\n* Number of left-handed female students: LF\n* Number of right-handed female students: RF\n* Number of left-handed male students: LM\n* Number of right-handed male students: RM\n\nWe can write down the following equations based on the given information:\n\n* LF + RF = 18 (total number of left-handed students)\n* LM + RM = 122 (total number of right-handed students)\n* RF = 5LF (number of right-handed female students is 5 times the number of left-handed female students)\n* RM = 9LM (number of right-handed male students is 9 times the number of left-handed male students)\n\nNow, we can solve the system of equations. We know that LF + RF = 18 and LM + RM = 122. Substituting RF = 5LF and RM = 9LM, we get:\n\nLF + 5LF = 18\nLM + 9LM = 122\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n6LF = 18\n10LM = 122\n\nNow, we can solve for LF and LM:\n\nLF = 3\nLM = 12\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female:\n\nProbability = (number of right-handed female students) / (total number of right-handed students)\nProbability = (RF) / (RM + RF)\nProbability = (5LF) / (9LM + 5LF)\nProbability = (5LF) / (12 + 5LF)\nProbability = (5LF) / 17\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nProbability = LF / 17\nProbability = 3 / 17\nProbability = 0.176\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
