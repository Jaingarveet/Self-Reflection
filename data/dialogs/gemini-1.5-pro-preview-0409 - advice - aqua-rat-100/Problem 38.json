The inner cube has a side length of 3cm (5cm - 2*1cm), so it contains 3*3*3 = 27 cubes.\nTherefore, there are 125 - 27 = 98 small cubes on the outer layer.\nEach small cube on the outer layer has 1 face painted. So, 98 small cubes have 1 painted face.\nThe remaining small cubes (27) are not painted on any face.\nThus, the total number of unpainted faces is 98*5 + 27*6 = 656.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\") \n"
