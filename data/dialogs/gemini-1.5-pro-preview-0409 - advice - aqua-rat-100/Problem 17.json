So, the monthly profit should be at least $626,400 / 12 = $52,200.\nThe company produces 420 units per month, with a production cost of $110 per unit. So, the total monthly production cost is 420 * $110 = $46,200.\nTo achieve the desired monthly profit, the company needs a monthly revenue of $52,200 (desired profit) + $46,200 (production cost) = $98,400.\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component should be $98,400 / 420 = $234.29. \nTo guarantee the minimum profit, we should round this up to the nearest dollar.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
