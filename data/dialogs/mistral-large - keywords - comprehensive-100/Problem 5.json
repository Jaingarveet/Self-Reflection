        "content": "Reflection:\nI made a calculation error when trying to find the number of members in the club. I incorrectly multiplied the age of the youngest member by 2 instead of dividing the sum of the ages by the age of the youngest member.\n\nThought:\nThe ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years, which is equivalent to 3000 months.\n\nTo find the number of members in the club, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:\n\nS = n/2 \\* (a + l)\n\nwhere S is the sum of the progression, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.\n\nWe know that S = 3000 and a = 84. We can find l by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic progression:\n\nl = a + (n - 1) \\* d\n\nwhere d is the common difference.\n\nWe can rearrange this formula to solve for n:\n\nn = (l - a) / d + 1\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nn = (3000 - 84 \\* n / 2) / 3 + 1\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nn = 1000 / (12 + n)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (12 + n), we get:\n\nn^2 + 12n - 1000 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we get:\n\nn = 25\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
