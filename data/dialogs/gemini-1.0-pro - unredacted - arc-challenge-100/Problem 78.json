Why is skin considered to be an organ?\nChoices:\n  A: It is made of cells.\n  B: It acts as a barrier.\n  C: It is made of tissues.\n  D: It is part of an organism.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the defining characteristic of an organ. \nI knew that the skin is made of cells, tissues, and acts as a barrier, but I did not realize that the key characteristic of an organ is that it is made of tissues.\nError Keywords:\n - Organ definition\n - Tissue definition\n - Cellular organization\nSolution:\nThe skin is the largest organ in the human body.\nAn organ is a group of tissues that work together to perform a specific function.\nThe skin is made up of multiple tissues, including the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous layer.\nThese tissues work together to protect the body from the environment, regulate temperature, and provide sensory information.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the key characteristics of an organ.\n2. Determine if the structure in question meets those characteristics.\n3. Consider the function of the structure and how it relates to the definition of an organ.\n4. Choose the answer that best reflects the definition of an organ.\nAdvice:\n - Understand the key characteristics of different biological structures.\n - Be able to differentiate between cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.\n - Consider the function of a structure when determining its classification.\n - Don't rely on memorized facts; understand the underlying principles.\n"
