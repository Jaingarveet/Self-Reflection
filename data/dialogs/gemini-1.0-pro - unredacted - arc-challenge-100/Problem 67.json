Carefully read the question and identify what it is asking for.\n2. Consider all possible answers that could be correct.\n3. Think about the specific context of the question.\n4. Choose the answer that best fits the question and the context.\n5. If multiple answers are possible, select all that apply.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking for.\n - Consider all possible answers that could be correct.\n - Think about the specific context of the question.\n - Choose the answer that best fits the question and the context.\n - If multiple answers are possible, select all that apply.\n - Don't assume that there is only one correct answer.\n - Be aware of your own biases and assumptions.\n - Be willing to revise your answer if you find new information.\n"
