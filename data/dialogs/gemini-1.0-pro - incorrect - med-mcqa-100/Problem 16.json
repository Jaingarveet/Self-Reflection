This anastomosis provides an alternative blood supply to the upper limb when the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed.\n**Key learning points:**\n* Pay close attention to the specific arteries involved in the anastomosis.\n* Avoid making assumptions based on incomplete information.\n* Double-check my reasoning before selecting an answer.\n## Applying the learnings to the current question:\n**Question:** In obstruction of second pa of axillary aery, the anastomosis between the following aery will maintain the blood supply of upper limb\n**Choices:**\n  A: Deep branch of transverse cervical aery & subscapular aery\n  B: Anterior & posterior circumflex humeral\n  C: Posterior circumflex humeral & circumflex scapular aery\n  D: Suprascapular & anterior circumflex humeral aery\n**Analysis:**\n* Option A: This is the correct answer, as explained above.\n* Option B: The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries are branches of the axillary artery, but they do not anastomose with each other.\n* Option C: As mentioned in the reflection, the circumflex scapular artery is not directly involved in the anastomosis.\n* Option D: The suprascapular artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, not the axillary artery.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\") \n"
