This leads to a decrease in the production of red blood cells, which are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.\nThe total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is a measure of the amount of iron that can be bound to transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood. In iron deficiency anemia, the TIBC is increased because there is less iron available to bind to transferrin.\nSerum ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. In iron deficiency anemia, the serum ferritin level is decreased because there is less iron available to be stored.\nThe transferrin saturation index (TSI) is a measure of the percentage of transferrin that is bound to iron. In iron deficiency anemia, the TSI is decreased because there is less iron available to bind to transferrin.\nBased on these findings, the correct answer is B: Decreased TIBC, decreased serum ferritin, Transferrin ferritin index <1.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
