Identify the argument's conclusion: to understand the true face of the emperor, one must read Ye Shi.\n2. Determine the gap in information: why is Ye Shi necessary if the official history is the emperor's diary?\n3. Analyze the options: which choice fills this gap and provides the missing link?\n4. Evaluate each choice: does it provide a valid reason for the argument's conclusion?\n5. Double-check your interpretation: does the chosen assumption align with the argument's logic?\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and identify the argument's conclusion.\n- Look for gaps in information or unstated premises.\n- Analyze each option critically and fill in those gaps.\n- Ensure that the chosen assumption logically supports the argument's conclusion.\n- Avoid personal interpretations or biases; focus on the information provided.\n"
