        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?\nChoices:\n  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.\n  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.\n  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.\n  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Opposite selection\n\nSolution: The correct answer is [REDACTED]. Choice [REDACTED] supports the idea that grassland degradation is a long-term process, suggesting that the storms are a natural phenomenon and inevitable. \n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question: Identify that the task is to select the option that supports the opinion that sand and dust storms are natural and inevitable. \n2. Interpret the choices: \n    - Choice [REDACTED]: Supports long-term grassland degradation, suggesting storms are natural.\n    - Choice [REDACTED]: Compares degraded and healthy grasslands, implying external factors.\n    - Choice [REDACTED]: Implies that human presence impacts grassland health.\n    - Choice [REDACTED]: Directly attributes storms to human activities.\n3. Evaluate each choice: \n    - Choice [REDACTED] supports the opinion that storms are a natural, long-term process.\n    - Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] all provide evidence of human influence, opposing the natural inevitability argument.\n4. Select the correct answer: Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer as it provides evidence that supports the opinion in question. \n\nAdvice:\n - Carefully read and understand the question, identifying the specific task.\n - Interpret the choices in the context of the question, evaluating each option independently. \n - Ensure you select an answer that directly supports the argument in the question, not the opposite. \n - Avoid choosing answers that provide evidence for a counterargument. \n - Always consider the context and implications of each choice.\n"
