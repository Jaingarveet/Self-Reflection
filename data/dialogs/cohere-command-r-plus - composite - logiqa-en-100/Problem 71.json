Identify the contradiction in the survey results.\n2. Understand that the options provide potential reasons for this contradiction.\n3. Analyze each choice to determine its relevance to resolving the contradiction. \n4. Recognize that choice [REDACTED] addresses the discrepancy between favorable views and actual hiring intentions.\n5. Interpret the statistical insights correctly:\n - 69% (favor) vs. 31% (better service) reveals a disconnect.\n - People like the idea, but not for superior service.\n6. Understand that choice [REDACTED] provides the most reasonable explanation for the contradiction.\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and identify the central contradiction or problem.\n- Recognize that each option presents a potential resolution to the contradiction.\n- Analyze each choice critically, focusing on its relevance to the central issue.\n- Interpret statistical insights and percentages correctly and in the context of the problem.\n- Ensure that you understand the underlying motivations and perceptions of the respondents.\n"
