The cavernous part of the internal carotid artery gives rise to several branches, including the cavernous branch, inferior hypophyseal artery, and ophthalmic artery. However, the meningeal artery is not a branch of the cavernous part but rather a branch of the middle meningeal artery, which arises from the maxillary artery.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
