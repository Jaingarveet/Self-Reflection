The presence of bilious vomiting suggests an obstruction in the proximal small intestine, as bile should not be present in the vomit of a newborn.\n\nThe images provided show a barium enema study, which demonstrates a transition zone in the distal small intestine, as well as an intestinal biopsy showing an absence of ganglion cells. These findings are consistent with congenital aganglionic megacolon, also known as Hirschsprung's disease.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
