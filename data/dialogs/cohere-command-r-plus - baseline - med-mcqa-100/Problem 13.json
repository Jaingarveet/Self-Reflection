This can obstruct the passage of food from the stomach, causing vomiting and other symptoms.\n\nThe investigation of choice for diagnosing pyloric stenosis is an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series, sometimes called a \"gastrografin series.\" This involves the patient swallowing a barium contrast liquid, which coats the digestive tract and allows for X-ray images to be taken. These images can clearly show the location and degree of pyloric narrowing, confirming the diagnosis.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
