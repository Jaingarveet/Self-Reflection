At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy mistake was in not considering all possible scenarios. \nI assumed that H must be on the top shelf, but it could also be on the middle shelf. \nIf L is on the bottom shelf, then H must be on the top shelf. \nIf L is on the middle shelf, then H could be on either the top or middle shelf. \nF and M cannot be on the top shelf, so they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. \nK cannot be on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf. \nO cannot be on the top shelf, so it must be on the middle or bottom shelf. \nI is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the same shelf as any of the other books. \nTherefore, the only option that must be true is that [REDACTED]\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Insufficient consideration\n - Limited scenario analysis\nSolution:\nIf L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H could be on the top or middle shelf. \nIf L is on the bottom shelf, then H must be on the top shelf. \nIf L is on the middle shelf, then H could be on either the top or middle shelf. \nF and M cannot be on the top shelf, so they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. \nK cannot be on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the top or middle shelf. \nO cannot be on the top shelf, so it must be on the middle or bottom shelf. \nI is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the same shelf as any of the other books. \nTherefore, the only option that must be true is that [REDACTED]\nInstructions:\n1.

Therefore, it is possible that H and M are on the same shelf, which would have to be the middle shelf since I is already on the middle shelf. Thus, the only option that must be true is that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other."
