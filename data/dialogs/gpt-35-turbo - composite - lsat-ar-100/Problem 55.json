Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable schedule of witnesses?\nChoices:\n  A: Monday: Franco Tuesday: Hong and Iturbe Wednesday: Garcia and Jackson\n  B: Monday: Franco and Hong Tuesday: Iturbe and Jackson Wednesday: Garcia\n  C: Monday: Garcia Tuesday: Franco and Iturbe Wednesday: Hong and Jackson\n  D: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Franco and Hong Wednesday: Iturbe\n  E: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Hong Wednesday: Franco and Iturbe\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my analysis of the possible schedules. \nI eliminated choice [REDACTED] because I thought that there were no witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday, but Iturbe and Hong are scheduled to testify on Wednesday in this schedule. \nError Keywords:\n - Misreading the question\n - Misinterpreting the conditions\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully read and interpret the given conditions. \nWe can eliminate some of the choices based on the conditions that are not met. \nWe need to check the remaining choices to ensure that they meet all the conditions. \nIn this case, choice [REDACTED] is the only schedule that meets all the conditions. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.\n3. Eliminate the choices that do not meet the conditions.\n4. Check the remaining choices to ensure that they meet all the conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that satisfies all the conditions.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the given conditions and constraints.\n - Always double-check your analysis and reasoning.\n - Always check all the remaining choices to ensure that they meet all the conditions.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is an essential skill in solving problems.\n"
