Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in counting the number of possible parking spaces for each employee. \nI correctly identified the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces but made a mistake in counting the number of possible parking spaces for each employee.\nError Keywords:\n - Counting error\n - Misinterpretation of rules\n - Misreading of the question\nSolution:\nRobertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. So, Robertson has only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces.\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, Young has only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces (#5 or #6) and Togowa has only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces (#1 or #2).\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. So, Xu has only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces (#3, #4, #5) and Souza has only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces (#1 or #2).\nVaughn has only one possible parking space.\nThe number of employees with only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces is 4 (Young, Togowa, Xu, and Souza).\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.\n3. Identify the number of possible parking spaces for each employee.\n4. Count the number of employees with only [REDACTED] possible parking spaces.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n6.
