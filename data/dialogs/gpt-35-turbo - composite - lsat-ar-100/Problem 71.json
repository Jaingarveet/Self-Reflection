Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misread the question and did not pay attention to the fact that the question asked for a list of sales representatives working in Zone 3, not the total number of sales representatives working in Zone 3. \nI also did not consider the fact that the question asked for a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3, not just any possible combination of sales representatives. \nError Keywords:\n - Misreading\n - Inattention to detail\n - Misunderstanding the question\n - Incorrect interpretation\nSolution:\nParra or Tiao works in Zone 1.\nTiao or Udall works in Zone 2.\nParra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.\nStuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.\nThere are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n[REDACTED], and Stuckey are not mentioned in any of the conditions that specify which sales representatives work in which sales zones. Therefore, they could work in any of the three sales zones. \nIf Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3. \nIf Udall works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 3. \nTherefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim and Mahr. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n2. Pay attention to the specific details and conditions given in the problem.\n3. Identify the relevant conditions and use them to eliminate impossible combinations.\n4. Identify the remaining possibilities and use them to determine the correct answer.\n5. Double-check your answer to make sure it is complete and accurate.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n - Pay attention to the specific details and conditions given in the problem.\n - Identify the relevant conditions and use them to eliminate impossible combinations.\n - Identify the remaining possibilities and use them to determine the correct answer.\n - Double-check your answer to make sure it is complete and accurate.\n - Remember that the question may ask for a specific type of answer, such as a complete and accurate list, rather than just any possible combination.\n"
