However, upon further review, I realized that the correct answer is the Inferior hypophyseal artery.\n\nThe cavernous part of the internal carotid artery divides into several branches, including the:\n\n* Cavernous branch\n* Internal carotid artery proper\n* Inferior hypophyseal artery\n* Ophthalmic artery\n\nThe Inferior hypophyseal artery is not a branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Inferior hypophyseal artery.\n\nFor future reference, I will make sure to double-check my answers and ensure that they are based on accurate knowledge of the subject matter. I will also take my time to read the question carefully and use my knowledge of anatomy to identify the correct branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery."
