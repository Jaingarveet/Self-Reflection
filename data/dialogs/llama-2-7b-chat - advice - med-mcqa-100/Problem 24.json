Based on my previous reflection, I will choose the correct answer this time.\n\nThe antithyroid drug that can be safely used in pregnancy is:\n\nC: Methimazole\n\nI have reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made an error in selecting Propylthiouracil. Methimazole is the safest option for pregnant women, as it has a better safety profile compared to other antithyroid drugs. It is less likely to cross the placenta and reach the fetus in significant amounts, reducing the risk of fetal harm.\n\nTherefore, I answer the question with confidence, and the correct answer is (C) Methimazole.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to improve my knowledge and provide accurate answers in the future."
