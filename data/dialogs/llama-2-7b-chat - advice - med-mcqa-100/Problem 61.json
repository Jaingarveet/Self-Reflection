I will take a step-by-step approach to solve the problem and double-check my calculations to ensure the correct answer.\n\nThe commonest type of seizure in newborns is:\n\nA) Clonic: This is incorrect. Clonic seizures are characterized by rhythmic jerking movements of the arms and legs, and they are not the most common type of seizure in newborns.\n\nB) Tonic: This is also incorrect. Tonic seizures are characterized by a stiffening of the muscles, and they are not the most common type of seizure in newborns.\n\nC) Myoclonic: This is the correct answer. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches, and they are the most common type of seizure in newborns.\n\nD) Subtle: This is not a valid answer. Subtle is not a type of seizure that is commonly associated with newborns.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) Myoclonic."
