Here's how I arrived at the correct answer:\n\n1. Read the question carefully: I made sure to read the question thoroughly and understand the problem.\n2. Decompose the problem into simpler steps: I broke down the problem into smaller parts to better comprehend it.\n3. Think through each subproblem step-by-step: I analyzed each part of the problem and thought through each step logically.\n4. Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning: I made sure to follow each step of my reasoning and double-checked my calculations.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the current question:\n\nThe principal site of acidification of urine is (A, B, C, or D).\n\nA: Loop of Henle - This is incorrect. The loop of Henle is not the principal site of acidification of urine.\n\nB: Collecting duct - This is the correct answer. The acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct, where hydrogen ions are secreted into the urine.\n\nC: DCT - This is incorrect. The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is not the principal site of acidification of urine.\n\nD: PCT - This is incorrect. The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is not the principal site of acidification of urine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Collecting duct."
