        "content": "  Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly as \"A: Primary structure\". However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is \"B: Secondary structure\".\n\nThe correct answer, \"B: Secondary structure\", is because denaturation does not affect the three-dimensional structure of a protein, which is the secondary structure. The secondary structure refers to the local arrangements of amino acids in a protein, such as alpha helices and beta sheets. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and are not disrupted during denaturation.\n\nIn contrast, the primary structure of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids, which can be altered during denaturation. The tertiary structure, or the overall 3D shape of the protein, can also be affected by denaturation, but this is not the answer choice provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"B: Secondary structure\"."
