Vitamin D Resistant Rickets is a condition where the body is unable to absorb vitamin D, leading to softening of the bones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: AD, which stands for \"Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets.\"\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer.
