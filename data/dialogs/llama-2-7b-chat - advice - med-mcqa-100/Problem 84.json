To answer this question correctly, I will break it down into smaller steps and use visual aids to help me understand the problem.\n\nStep 1: Identify the purpose of the question. The question is asking which medication affects the aqueous outflow in the eye.\n\nStep 2: Review the options. The options are Timolol, Pilocarpine, Brimonidine, and Brinzolamide.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options. Timolol and Pilocarpine are both beta-blockers, which reduce the amount of aqueous humor produced in the eye. Brimonidine is an alpha-agonist, which increases the amount of aqueous humor produced in the eye. Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which reduces the amount of aqueous humor produced in the eye.\n\nStep 4: Select the correct answer. Based on the information provided, the correct answer is (B) Pilocarpine.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
