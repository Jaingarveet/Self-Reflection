A histogram is the appropriate graphical representation for trends, as it displays the distribution of data over a range of values.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I will break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify the type of data and trend being represented. In this case, the data represents the number of people who have a particular disease, and the trend is the change in the number of people over time.\n\nStep 2: Choose the appropriate graphical representation for the data and trend. As mentioned earlier, a histogram is the best choice for displaying the distribution of data over a range of values, which is the case for the trend being represented.\n\nStep 3: Create the graphical representation. In this case, I will create a histogram that shows the number of people with the disease at different points in time.\n\nStep 4: Double-check my work to ensure accuracy. I will make sure that the histogram is correctly labeled and that the data is accurately represented.\n\nBased on my reflection, I will answer the question correctly by selecting (C) Histogram.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
