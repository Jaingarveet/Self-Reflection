I will use my knowledge of pediatric cardiology to identify the type of congenital heart defect based on the chest X-ray findings.\n\nThe chest X-ray shows a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a prominent aortic arch and pulmonary artery. This is consistent with diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).\n\nTherefore, the most probable diagnosis for the neonate presenting with heart failure on day 7 of life is Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
