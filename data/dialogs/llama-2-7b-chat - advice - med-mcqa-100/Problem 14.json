However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct end product is 2 ATP + 2 NADH.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, I reviewed the process of anaerobic glycolysis, which involves the breakdown of glucose in the absence of oxygen. The net end product of this process is 2 ATP + 2 NADH, not 2 ATP + 2 NAD.\n\nI understand that this mistake was due to a calculation error, and I will make sure to double-check my calculations in the future. Additionally, I will practice regularly to reinforce my understanding of biochemistry and seek additional resources if needed.\n\nNow, to answer the question, I will select choice (C): 2 ATP + 2 NADH as the correct answer."
