Here's how I arrived at the correct answer:\n\nStep 1: Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\nThe question asks why time-sector scanning of neonates is preferred, and it provides four options as reasons.\n\nStep 2: Decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.\nI broke down the problem into the following subproblems:\n\n* What is time-sector scanning?\n* Why is it preferred for neonates?\n\nStep 3: Think through each subproblem step-by-step.\nFor the first subproblem, I realized that time-sector scanning is a technique used in radiology to acquire images of the body in a series of thin slices, with each slice obtained at a specific angle.\n\nFor the second subproblem, I understood that time-sector scanning is preferred for neonates because it provides better resolution than other imaging techniques. This is because neonates have a developing brain and delicate tissues that require high-resolution images to detect any abnormalities.\n\nStep 4: Double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\nI double-checked my answer by reviewing the information provided in the question and making sure that I had correctly identified the reason why time-sector scanning is preferred for neonates.\n\nConclusion:\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Better resolution. Time-sector scanning is preferred for neonates because it provides higher resolution images than other imaging techniques, which is essential for detecting any abnormalities in the developing brain and delicate tissues of newborns."
