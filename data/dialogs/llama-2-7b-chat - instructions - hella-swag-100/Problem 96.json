[step] Biennials should be planted in the late spring or early summer to avoid early flowering from exposure to cold temperatures. If the plants flower during the first year, it is likely because they were exposed to frost.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] While waiting to plant, store the vegetable seeds in bags in a warm, dry location. In colder climates, you can get a head start by planting the seeds indoors, and then moving them outside when the weather improves.\n  B: Varieties that do not flower then will flower later. [substeps] Before planting your vegetables in april or june, begin checking them every second day to make sure the soil is even.\n  C: During the growing season, using a frost rake every six to seven weeks is ideal. [substeps] Rows should be spaced with patches of grass spaced about two or three feet apart, and that grass should fall between 12-12 inches (30-61 cm) in length.\n  D: [substeps] If your plants are grown in the late spring or summer, wait for a temperature that's between 30 and 35 degrees fahrenheit (4 to 5 degrees celsius) for the ripen phase to improve growth.

I realized that I misunderstood the context of the text and the information provided. Here is my revised answer:\n\nThe most likely completion to the text is:\n\nB: Varieties that do not flower then will flower later.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text states that biennials should be planted in the late spring or early summer to avoid early flowering from exposure to cold temperatures. This implies that some varieties of biennials may not flower in the first year, but will flower later on. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\n[REDACTED]"
