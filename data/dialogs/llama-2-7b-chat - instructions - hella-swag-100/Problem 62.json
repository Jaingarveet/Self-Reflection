Once exposed to air, the wrap should immediately begin heating, reaching its maximum temperature in about half an hour.\n\nReflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the instructions. The correct answer is (B): There are a few precautions you must take regarding opening the wrap before using a Thermacare on your entire body when it is hot outside. You must also take steps: stand close to a wall with plenty of space in between the heat wrap and the wall and ceiling.\n\nThe reason for this answer is that the text specifically mentions that the wrap should be unwrapped thirty minutes before use, which suggests that the chemical ingredients need time to activate. Additionally, the text advises against opening the wrap too early, as this could limit its exposure to air and slow down the heating process. Therefore, it is important to follow the instructions carefully and take the necessary precautions to ensure that the wrap heats properly.\n\nAny information that I am not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED]."
