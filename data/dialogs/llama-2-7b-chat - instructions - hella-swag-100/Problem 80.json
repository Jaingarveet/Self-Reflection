Ask the officer why you were stopped so that you know what kinds of questions he is legally permitted to ask you.\"\n\nReflection:\nIn this scenario, it is important to understand that the officer has the right to ask questions, but you have the right to know why you are being stopped. By asking the officer why you were stopped, you can determine the scope of the investigation and the types of questions the officer is legally permitted to ask you. This can help you to provide a more informed and appropriate response.\n\nIn my previous answer, I selected option B, which is incorrect. I misunderstood the scenario and thought the officer could only ask questions about the particular suspicious activity observed. However, upon reflection, I realize that the officer has the right to ask questions beyond that, and it is important to know why you were stopped in order to provide a more informed response.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: \"Ask why you were stopped so that you know what kinds of questions the officer is legally permitted to ask you.\""
