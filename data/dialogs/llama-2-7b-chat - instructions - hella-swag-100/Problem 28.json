Given that the woman has finished drawing the game, it is likely that she will push her kids to the center so that the line can come together, which is a common next step in playing hopscotch.\n\nDouble-check: I have double-checked my answer, and I am confident that it is the most likely completion to the text based on the information provided.\n\n[REDACTED]"
