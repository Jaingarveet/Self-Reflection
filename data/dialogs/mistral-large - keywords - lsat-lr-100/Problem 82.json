Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question\n* Focusing on the wrong aspect of the argument\n* Critical thinking error\n* Argument analysis error\n"

The question is asking for the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection, not for evidence supporting Patricia's original claim.\n\nThought:\nTo counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the squeaky floors were not necessarily a response to the threat of ninjas.\n\nChoice B is the strongest counter because it suggests that the squeaky floors would not have been effective against ninjas, and therefore their presence in wealthy Japanese homes does not necessarily indicate a fear of ninjas.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
