        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstood principle\n* Misinterpreted argument\n* Misapplied principle\n"

I thought the principle was that a person cannot be punished for an illegal act if the person who obtained the evidence against them also committed an illegal act. However, the principle is actually that evidence obtained illegally cannot be used to justify punitive measures against the person who committed the illegal act. I also misapplied the principle by choosing an answer that did not illustrate this principle. The correct answer is D because it shows that the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner for setting illegal animal traps because she was trespassing at the time she discovered the traps, which means she obtained the evidence illegally."
