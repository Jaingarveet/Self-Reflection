If the human resources department is on the first floor, the administration department must be on the second floor, and the planning department is on the third floor (as it is below the administration department). This leaves the finance department to be on the fourth floor, with the sales and R&D departments on the fifth and sixth floors, respectively.\n2. If the human resources department is on the second floor, the planning department must be on the first or third floor. If it's on the first floor, then the administration is on the third, finance on the fourth, and sales and R&D on the fifth and sixth, or vice versa. If the planning department is on the third floor, then administration is on the fourth, finance on the fifth, and sales and R&D on the sixth floor.\n3. If the human resources department is on the third floor, the planning department must be on the second floor (as it is below the administration department). This means the administration department is on the fifth floor, with finance on the first, sales on the fourth, and R&D on the sixth, or finance on the sixth, sales on the fifth, and R&D on the first floor.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A, C, and D.\nAction: Answer(\"A, C, D\")"
