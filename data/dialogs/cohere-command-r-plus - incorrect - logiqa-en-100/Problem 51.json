If X is in sales, then W is in production.\n4. F must be in production.\n\nIf X and F are in the same department, this department must be production (from condition 4).\n\n Now, we can examine the statements:\n\nStatement A: G is assigned to the sales department. This can be true, as there are no conditions stating otherwise, and F and G don't have to be in the same department.\n\nStatement B: H is assigned to the production department. This can also be true, as there are no conditions preventing this. H and Y can be in production or sales, as long as they are in the same department.\n\nStatement C: I was assigned to the sales department. Again, this is possible, as there are no conditions restricting I's department.\n\nStatement D: W is assigned to public relations. This statement must be false if X and F are in the same department (production). If X is in production, then W must be in sales (from condition 3), so W cannot be in public relations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
