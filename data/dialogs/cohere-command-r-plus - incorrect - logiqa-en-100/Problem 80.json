Finance Department\n2. Planning Department\n3. Administration Department\n4. Human Resources Department\n5. Sales Department\n6. R&D Department\n\nIn this arrangement, the finance and planning departments are on the bottom two floors, which satisfies the given conditions. The administration department is correctly placed above the planning department and below the human resources department. However, this arrangement implies that the sales and R&D departments are adjacent, which is not allowed according to the conditions. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C:\n1. Planning Department\n2. Finance Department\n3. Sales Department\n4. R&D Department\n5. Administration Department\n6. Human Resources Department\n\nSimilarly, this arrangement places the finance and planning departments together, and it also keeps the sales and R&D departments apart. The administration department is still correctly positioned. Most importantly, the human resources department is not adjacent to the sales department, satisfying all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
