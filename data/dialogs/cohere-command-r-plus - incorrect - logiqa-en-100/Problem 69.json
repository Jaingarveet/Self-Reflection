In other words, it must be a statement that, if false, would make the inference valid.\n\nIf Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, it does not necessarily mean that Zhang Shan's bonus is also higher than Li Si's. This assumption does not invalidate the inference, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nIf Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, it could be possible that Zhang Shan's bonus is also higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, but this is not a definite relationship. This assumption does not invalidate the inference, so it is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is likely either C or D, as these assumptions create a definite relationship between the bonuses that, if false, would make the inference valid.\n\nIf Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's, then it cannot be true that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's. This assumption creates a contradiction and invalidates the inference, so it is the correct answer.\n\nReflection: The correct answer is C because it creates a definite relationship that contradicts the given information. Assumptions A and B do not definitely imply a specific relationship, so they are not sufficient to invalidate the inference. Assumption D suggests that Li Si and Wang Wu received equal bonuses, which still allows for the possibility that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than either of them, so it is also not a valid exception to the inference.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
