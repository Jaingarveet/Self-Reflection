As the state controls the scale of loans, private lending becomes an attractive alternative with higher interest rates than banks, providing a plausible explanation for the outflow of savings deposits.\n\nOption A mentions expected price increases, but does not explain why residents would withdraw their savings or where the funds would go.\nOption B suggests residents might withdraw funds in anticipation of higher bank interest rates, but this is not the focus of the question, which asks about the outflow of deposits, not future deposit plans.\nOption D discusses residents' considerations between different investment options, but does not provide a reason for the significant outflow of savings funds.\n\nTherefore, choice C is the best explanation that aligns with the information given in the context.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
