However, it does not fully explain why accident rates are similar across cities with varying enforcement approaches. \n\nChoice C suggests that improving driver education and awareness might be a more effective strategy than strict enforcement, providing a potential alternative explanation for the survey findings. \n\nChoice D proposes that a comprehensive approach targeting multiple traffic violations, including but not limited to drunk driving, might be necessary to effectively reduce accident rates. This suggestion addresses a potential limitation of focusing solely on drunk driving investigations. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. By acknowledging the complexity of traffic safety and advocating for a multifaceted approach, choice D offers the most promising direction for reconciling the inconsistent findings.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
