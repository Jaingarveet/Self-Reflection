The gravitational field strength on the Moon is about 1/6th of that on Earth. Therefore, the weight of the astronaut on the Moon is about 1/6th of his weight on Earth. To find the weight and mass of the astronaut on Earth, we need to multiply the weight on the Moon by 6 and convert the mass from kilograms to pounds.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
