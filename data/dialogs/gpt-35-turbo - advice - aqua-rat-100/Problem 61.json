This means that he had already driven 70 miles from A to B, and had 3 more hours of driving left. We can use this information to set up another equation:\n70 + 70 = 90(t2 - 3)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nt2 = 8\nNow we can use the equation d = 90t2 to solve for d:\nd = 90(8)\nd = 720\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
