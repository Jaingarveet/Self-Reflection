Let A be the event that a chocolate is vanilla flavored and B be the event that a chocolate is not squashed. We want to find P(A and B). We know that P(B|cocoa) = 0, P(cocoa) = 0.1, P(B|vanilla) = 0.9, and P(vanilla) = 0.9. We can use the formula P(A and B) = P(B|vanilla) * P(A) to find the answer. \nP(A) = P(vanilla) = 0.9\nP(B|vanilla) = 0.9\nP(A and B) = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81\nThe percentage of the chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 81/100 * 100% = 81%.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\") [The correct answer is not listed in the choices.
