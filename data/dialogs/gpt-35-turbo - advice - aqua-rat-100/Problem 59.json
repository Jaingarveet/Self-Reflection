If one out of 20 marbles is black, then 20 * (1/20) = 1 black marble was pulled out the second time. If this represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, then there must be 1 black marble out of Q marbles in the bag. We can set up the equation (1/Q) * 100 = 1/20 * 100 and solve for Q. First, simplify the equation to 100/Q = 5, then cross-multiply to get Q = 20 * 5 = 100.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
