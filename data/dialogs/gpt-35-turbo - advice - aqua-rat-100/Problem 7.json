If we use a single letter to represent each type, we would need at least 10 letters of the alphabet. If we use pairs of letters, we would need to choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first pair, and 25 letters out of 26 for the second pair (since we cannot repeat the first letter). However, since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting. Therefore, the total number of pairs of letters is (26*25)/2 = 325. We need to choose the smallest number of letters, so we should choose the option that is less than 10 and greater than 325/26.\nCalculation:\n325/26 = 12.5\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
