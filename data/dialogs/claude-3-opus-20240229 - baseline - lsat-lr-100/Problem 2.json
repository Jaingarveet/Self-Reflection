This year, most of the prize-winning films at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nNow, let's consider each answer choice:\nA: This can't be inferred. We don't know if most Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec. The information is about the reverse - films that won at Lac Nichoutec also winning at international festivals.\nB: We can't determine this. The information doesn't tell us about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nC: This must be true. If most Lac Nichoutec prize-winners, which are all Canadian films, also won at international festivals, then some of the international prize-winners must have been Canadian films.\nD: This can't be determined. While we know most Lac Nichoutec winners also won internationally, we don't know if all of them did.\nE: This can't be determined. The information doesn't preclude the possibility that all international prize-winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nTherefore, C is the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
