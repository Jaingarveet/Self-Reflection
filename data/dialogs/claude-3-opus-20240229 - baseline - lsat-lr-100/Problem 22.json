The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.\n  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.\n  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n1. The argument concludes that Grey likely read Jordan's book because they used the same unusual metaphor, and Jordan's book was published first.\n2. To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for why Grey used the same metaphor as Jordan, without having read her book.\n3. Choice A states that a text published in 1860, before either Jordan's or Grey's book, contained the same unusual metaphor and was probably known to both authors. This provides an alternative source from which both authors could have independently gotten the metaphor, weakening the argument that Grey must have read Jordan's book.\n4. Choices B, C, D, and E do not provide an alternative explanation for the similarity in the metaphors. They discuss the content of the books, the intended audience, Jordan's later use of the metaphor, and Grey's writing style, but none of these directly address the key point of how Grey could have used the same metaphor without reading Jordan's book.\nTherefore, choice A most weakens the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
