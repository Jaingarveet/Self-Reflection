So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Smith's statements can most directly be used as part of an argument for which one of the following views?\nChoices:\n  A: A democratic government does not infringe on the rights of any of its citizens.\n  B: Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.\n  C: News programs for children would give them enough information to enable them to vote in an informed way.\n  D: If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted.\n  E: If parents do not adequately represent their children's interests in the political sphere, those interests will be adequately represented by someone else.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze Smith's statements and see which view they most directly support:\n1. Smith acknowledges that children's interests are not always the same as their parents', and that government deficits can affect children's future standard of living.\n2. However, Smith argues that children's conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults.\n3. Therefore, Smith concludes that we cannot give children the responsibility of voting.\nSmith's argument essentially states that while children's interests may differ from their parents', they are not capable of making informed voting decisions due to their limited understanding and different time horizons. This implies that the limitations on full democracy resulting from denying children the right to vote must be accepted.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
