As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination?\nChoices:\n  A: It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.\n  B: It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments.\n  C: It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.\n  D: It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs.\n  E: It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting.\n"

However, the teacher points out that critics argue it can also make children who are not well-developed feel inferior, a feeling that never really disappears.\n3. The teacher then counters this criticism by stating that research shows adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those without such anxieties.\n4. Therefore, the teacher concludes that funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.\nThe role of the assertion that participating in competitive athletics may increase strength and coordination is mentioned as a possible benefit, but it is not the main reason the teacher is arguing against eliminating funding. \nInstead, the teacher is countering the critics' argument about feelings of inferiority by suggesting those feelings can lead to more success later in life. This is an additional reason the teacher offers for not eliminating funding, making choice D the most accurate description of the role played by the assertion in question.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
