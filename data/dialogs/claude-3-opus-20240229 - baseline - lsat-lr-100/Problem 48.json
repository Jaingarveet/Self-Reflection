To maintain educational quality, they must market programs more aggressively.\n3. Without such marketing, they can't increase enrollment.\nThe conclusion is that to maintain educational quality, they must market programs more aggressively.\nFor this conclusion to be properly drawn, there must be an assumption that links aggressive marketing to maintaining educational quality.\nLooking at the choices:\nA. This goes against the argument, not an assumption.\nB. This could be an assumption, but not directly related to the conclusion about maintaining quality.\nC. This connects marketing and enrollment but not directly to maintaining quality.\nD. This looks promising - it connects reduced spending to not maintaining quality, which is the core of the argument.\nE. This is similar to B, but doesn't directly connect to the conclusion about maintaining quality.\nThe best answer is D. It assumes that if the university reduces spending, it will be unable to maintain educational quality, which is the key link needed for the conclusion to follow.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
