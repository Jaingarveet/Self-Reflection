        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?\nChoices:\n  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.\n  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.\n"

        "content": "To explain why smokers of both low and high-nicotine cigarettes have the same blood nicotine levels, we need to find a choice that accounts for this finding.\nA: This could explain the finding, as it suggests there is a maximum daily nicotine absorption limit that even low-nicotine cigarettes reach. However, it doesn't fully explain why high-nicotine smokers don't have higher levels.\nB: If low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, they could end up absorbing as much nicotine as high-nicotine cigarette smokers. This helps explain the equal nicotine levels.\nC: This choice suggests most nicotine gets absorbed regardless of quantity, but it doesn't explain why low and high-nicotine smokers end up with the same levels. More information is needed.\nD and E: The tar levels and nicotine elimination rates do not help explain the similar absorption finding between low and high-nicotine smokers.\nTherefore, B is the best explanation - low-nicotine smokers likely smoke more cigarettes to compensate, ending up with the same nicotine levels as high-nicotine smokers.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
