Although scholars and diplomats in the sacrosanct inner circle of international affairs would have us think otherwise, anyone with an acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information can quickly learn to conduct a successful foreign policy. In fact, prior experience alone will be of little value to a foreign policymaker who lacks all three of these traits.\nQuestion: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Scholars and diplomats have more experience in foreign affairs than most presidents and prime ministers bring to office.\n  B: Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.\n  C: Prior experience in foreign affairs is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.\n  D: An acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information are each necessary conditions for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.\n  E: A president or prime minister with years of experience in foreign affairs will have a more successful foreign policy than one who does not have experience in foreign affairs.\n"

Scholars and diplomats believe prior experience is crucial, but the passage suggests otherwise.\n3. Anyone with an acute political sense, disciplined temperament, and ability to absorb and retain information can quickly learn to conduct a successful foreign policy.\n4. Prior experience alone is of little value without these three traits.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA: This may be true, but it's not necessarily true based on the information provided.\nB: This aligns with the passage. Prior experience is not necessary (many successful leaders had none) and not sufficient (it's of little value without the three key traits).\nC: This contradicts the passage, which states that prior experience is not necessary.\nD: While these traits are important, the passage doesn't state that each is necessary.\nE: This contradicts the passage, which suggests leaders without experience can be more successful than those with experience but lacking the key traits.\nTherefore, choice B must be true based on the information provided.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
