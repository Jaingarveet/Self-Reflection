The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either.\n  B: Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.\n  C: Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.\n  D: Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics.\n  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The microbiologist's argument is that exposure to heavy metals in sewage sludge has somehow promoted the bacteria's resistance to antibiotics.\n2. To strengthen this argument, we need to find a choice that provides evidence of a link between heavy metal exposure and antibiotic resistance.\n3. Let's look at each choice:\n   A) This doesn't provide a direct link between heavy metal exposure and antibiotic resistance. It's about bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics.\n   \n   B) This choice suggests that bacteria in sewage sludge without heavy metals are not resistant to heavy metals or antibiotics. This supports the idea that heavy metal exposure is linked to antibiotic resistance.\n   \n   C) This choice suggests the reverse causality - that antibiotic resistance contributes to heavy metal resistance. This doesn't strengthen the argument about heavy metals causing antibiotic resistance.\n   \n   D) The presence of antibiotics in the sludge could be an alternative explanation for the antibiotic resistance, weakening the heavy metal hypothesis.\n   \n   E) Bacteria outside of sewage sludge being resistant to both heavy metals and antibiotics doesn't provide evidence for the specific link in sewage sludge that the microbiologist is arguing for.\n4. Choice B provides the most direct support for the microbiologist's argument by suggesting that without heavy metal exposure, the bacteria are not resistant to antibiotics.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
