The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA: This is not necessarily true, as the store sells prints of some works not in the museum's collection, like Nighthawks.\nB: This must be true. The museum only displays twentieth-century works, and the store sells prints of works from the museum's collection and some that aren't, but all are from the twentieth century.\nC: This is not necessarily true. The store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection, but not necessarily all works on display (some may be on loan).\nD: We can't determine this. Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection, but it's unclear if it's on loan to the museum or not displayed at all.\nE: We can't determine this either. The fact that the store sells prints of Nighthawks doesn't necessarily mean it's not displayed in the museum.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
