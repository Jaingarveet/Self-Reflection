To weaken this argument, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for Carl's low case-solving rate, one that doesn't imply his incompetence.\n3. Choice A states that Carl is assigned only the most difficult cases that others have failed to solve. This provides a strong alternative explanation for his low success rate - it's not due to his incompetence, but rather the inherent difficulty of the cases he's given.\n4. Choices B, C, D, and E provide additional information about Carl's background or the police department, but none of them directly address or undermine the reason given for Carl's perceived incompetence.\nTherefore, choice A is the best answer as it most seriously weakens the argument by offering a compelling alternative explanation for Carl's low case-solving rate.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
