His contributions significantly shaped the development of modern lighting and communication systems. Yet he had only a few months of formal schooling. Therefore, you do not need a formal education to make crucial contributions to technological advancement. Frank: That is definitely not true anymore. Since Edison's day there have been many new developments in technology; to make crucial contributions today you need much more extensive technical knowledge than was needed then.\nQuestion: Frank's reasoning in his response to Maria is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\nChoices:\n  A: fails to address the possibility that technical knowledge may be acquired without formal education\n  B: does not consider whether there have been improvements in formal education since Edison's day\n  C: relies on using the term \"crucial\" differently from the way Maria used it\n  D: presumes that no other inventor of Edison's time could have been as productive as Edison\n  E: fails to criticize or question any of Maria's statements about Edison\n"

Frank assumes that extensive technical knowledge requires formal education, but he doesn't consider that such knowledge could be acquired informally, as Edison did.\nB) While this is a fair point, it's not as relevant to the main issue. Improvements in formal education don't necessarily mean it's the only way to gain technical knowledge.\nC) There's no clear indication that Frank is using \"crucial\" differently from Maria. They both seem to be referring to important contributions to technological advancement.\nD) Frank's argument doesn't rely on comparing Edison to other inventors of his time. It's focused on the knowledge needed to make contributions in the present day versus Edison's day.\nE) Frank is addressing Maria's main point about the necessity of formal education, not attempting to criticize her specific statements about Edison.\nThe most valid criticism is that Frank doesn't consider alternative ways of acquiring technical knowledge besides formal education, which was key to Maria's argument about Edison.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
