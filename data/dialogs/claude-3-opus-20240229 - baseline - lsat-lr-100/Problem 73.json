But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public.\nQuestion: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that\nChoices:\n  A: the press can publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives\n  B: one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it\n  C: the publishing of information about the personal lives of private individuals cannot be libelous\n  D: if one has an obligation to do something then one has a right to do it\n  E: the press's right to publish always outweighs the individual's right not to be libeled\n"

However, it also says the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless it's libelous.\n3. It concludes that if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, as such information is of interest to the public.\nThe flaw in this reasoning is that it assumes that having the right to do something means having an obligation to do it. Just because the press has the right to publish non-libelous stories about private individuals doesn't necessarily mean they are obligated to do so.\nThe argument jumps from \"the press has a right to publish\" to \"the press has an obligation to publish\" without justifying that leap in logic.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
