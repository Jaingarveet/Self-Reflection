The person then returns and tries to reconstruct the dream by asking only yes-or-no questions. In fact, no dream has been related: the group simply answers the questions according to some arbitrary rule. Surprisingly, the person usually constructs a dream narrative that is both coherent and ingenious.\nQuestion: The example presented above most closely conforms to which one of the following propositions?\nChoices:\n  A: The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence.\n  B: One is less apt to reach a false understanding of what someone says than to make no sense out of it at all.\n  C: Dreams are often just collections ofiruages and ideas without coherent structures.\n  D: Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative.\n  E: People often invent clever and coherent stories to explain their behavior to other people.\n"

Despite this, the person usually constructs a coherent and ingenious dream narrative.\nNow, let's consider each answer choice:\nA: This choice aligns with the example. The person presumes there is a coherent dream and, based on that presumption, constructs a coherent narrative even though no actual dream was shared.\nB, C, D, E: These choices do not accurately reflect the main point of the example, which is about imposing order and coherence on something that lacks inherent order and coherence.\nTherefore, choice A is the best answer.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
