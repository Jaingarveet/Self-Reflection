So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.\nQuestion: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?\nChoices:\n  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.\n  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.\n  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.\n  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.\n  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.\n"

Therefore, if not R, then Q. \n      - This is close, but it's saying \"P if not R\" instead of \"P only if R\".\n   E) If P, then Q. But also if T, then Q. Therefore, if T, then preventing P will not prevent Q. \n      - This is different. It's concluding something about the effect of preventing P when T is true.\n4. Choice B matches the original argument's structure and flawed reasoning exactly.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
