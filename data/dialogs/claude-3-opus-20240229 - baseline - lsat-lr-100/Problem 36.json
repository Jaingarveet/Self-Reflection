The argument states that native speakers perceive sentences in their language as separate words, but this is an illusion.\n2. The evidence provided is that travelers who don't know the local language hear an uninterrupted stream of sound instead of distinct words.\nThe argument assumes that the travelers' perception of the unfamiliar language as an uninterrupted stream of sound is more accurate than the native speakers' perception of distinct words.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. The argument doesn't assume that understanding is impossible if sentences are uninterrupted streams of sound.\nB. The argument doesn't make any assumptions about the actual sound of the language, only the perception of it.\nC. The argument doesn't compare the attention paid by native speakers and non-native speakers.\nD. The argument doesn't discuss the perceptions of accomplished non-native speakers.\nE. This choice matches the assumption that the travelers' perception is more accurate than the native speakers' perception.\nTherefore, the assumption the argument depends on is:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
