Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The passage states that until 1985, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes. After 1985, it was changed to every hour.\n2. It also states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished, the higher the level of carbon dioxide and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to spread.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) The passage doesn't mention regulations, so this isn't strongly supported.\nB) This is supported. If cabin air is replenished less frequently now, it's easier for airborne illnesses to spread, so people are more likely to contract them.\nC) The passage suggests the opposite - low levels of carbon dioxide make it harder, not impossible, for airborne illnesses to spread.\nD) The passage doesn't provide information about whether the 1980 rate was sufficient to protect passengers.\nE) This is supported. In 1980, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes, leading to lower carbon dioxide levels than today's hourly replenishment.\n4. Both B and E are supported by the passage, but E is more directly stated, while B requires an inference about the likelihood of contracting illnesses.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
