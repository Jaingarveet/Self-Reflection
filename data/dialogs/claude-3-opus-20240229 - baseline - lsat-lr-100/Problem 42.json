Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose \"unyielding,\" because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?\nChoices:\n  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact\n  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives\n  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n1. The passage discusses a situation where a group is unable to reach consensus and members accuse each other of being stubborn or unyielding.\n2. It suggests that if someone wants to make such an accusation, they should use the term \"unyielding\" because it can be proven by the fact that the person has not yielded.\n3. This is a form of argument where if you accept the premise (that the person has not yielded), you must accept the conclusion (that they are unyielding).\n4. Therefore, the passage is conditionally advocating using the term \"unyielding\" on the grounds that it results in an argument where if you accept the premise, you can't deny the conclusion.\n5. This matches the description in choice E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
