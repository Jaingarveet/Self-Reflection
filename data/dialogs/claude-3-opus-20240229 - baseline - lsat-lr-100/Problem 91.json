Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n"

It states that the proteins causing allergies vary from person to person.\nB: This is strongly supported. The passage states that a cat may cause allergies in some people but not all, implying no cat causes allergies in everyone.\nC: While this may be true, the passage does not directly state or imply that cats differ in their allergy-causing proteins.\nD: The passage does not compare the intensity of allergic reactions between individuals.\nE: While the passage suggests variability in allergic reactions, it does not state that there is no way to predict them.\nChoice B is most strongly supported by the information provided. The passage clearly states that a cat may cause allergies in some allergy sufferers but not others, meaning no single cat causes allergies in all sufferers.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
