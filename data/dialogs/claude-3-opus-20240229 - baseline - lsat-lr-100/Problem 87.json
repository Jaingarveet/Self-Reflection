One group's members all attended weekly support group meetings, but no one from the other group attended support group meetings. After 10 years, 41 patients from each group had died. Clearly, support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Of the 4 patients who survived more than 10 years, the 2 who had attended weekly support group meetings lived longer than the 2 who had not.\n  B: For many diseases, attending weekly support group meetings is part of the standard medical treatment.\n  C: The members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group.\n  D: Some physicians have argued that attending weekly support group meetings gives patients less faith in the standard treatment for disease T.\n  E: Everyone in the group whose members attended weekly support group meetings reported after 1 year that those meetings had helped them to cope with the disease.\n"

It doesn't address the overall effect on the entire group, so it doesn't significantly weaken the argument.\nB: This statement is about many diseases in general, not specifically about disease T. It doesn't directly weaken the argument about the effectiveness of support group meetings for disease T.\nC: If the members of the support group lived 2 years longer on average, this directly contradicts the conclusion that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. This statement seriously weakens the argument.\nD: The physicians' argument about patients having less faith in the standard treatment doesn't directly address the effectiveness of support group meetings on the patients' longevity. It doesn't significantly weaken the argument.\nE: The patients' self-reported ability to cope with the disease after 1 year doesn't necessarily translate to increased longevity, which is the focus of the argument. This statement doesn't directly weaken the argument about the meetings' effect on the patients' lifespan.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
