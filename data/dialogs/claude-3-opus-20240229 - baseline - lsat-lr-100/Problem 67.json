However, the argument points out that it's nearly impossible to discover what these lessons are, even if we could accurately determine what the past was like.\n3. The argument uses the example of World War I, questioning what lessons we are supposed to learn from it.\n4. It further states that even if we could discover these lessons, it's unclear if we could apply them, as we will never have a situation exactly like World War I again.\nThe argument seems to be directed toward discrediting the idea that we should learn the lessons of history. It does this by pointing out the difficulties in determining what those lessons are and the challenges in applying them to different situations.\nTherefore, the statement \"we should learn the lessons of history\" is used in the argument in a way that expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
