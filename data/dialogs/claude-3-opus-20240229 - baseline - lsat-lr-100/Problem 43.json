Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\n"

If \"love\" refers to a feeling, this promise makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control.\n3. A promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense.\n4. Therefore, no one should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nThe conclusion follows logically if we assume that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.
