Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Patricia's main point is that there was little ninja activity during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time.\n2. Tamara counters by saying that many wealthy Japanese had their houses built with squeaky floors to get warning if a ninja was present, implying that the wealthy did fear ninjas.\n3. To effectively counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to provide a fact that undermines the idea that the squeaky floors were built due to fear of ninjas.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   A: This doesn't counter Tamara's point, as it suggests even more people feared ninjas.\n   B: If ninjas could walk on squeaky floors silently, it would make the squeaky floors ineffective against them, supporting Patricia's point.\n   C: This doesn't directly address the reason for the squeaky floors.\n   D: This is about the perception of ninjas after the Tokugawa period, not during it.\n   E: This is not directly relevant to the squeaky floor issue.\n5. Choice B, if true, would be the strongest counter. It suggests that the squeaky floors were not effective against ninjas, undermining the idea that they were built out of fear of ninjas.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
