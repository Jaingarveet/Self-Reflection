To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?\nChoices:\n  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.\n  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.\n  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.\n  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\n  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that wetland development must be regulated to protect wildlife, by requiring replacement wetlands to be constructed to offset any development.\n2. The Figorian Development Commission argues that Figoria has conserved its wetlands while other nations have developed theirs, so Figoria should be allowed to develop its wetlands for economic growth, especially since it might not affect wildlife.\n3. We need to find the principle that most strongly supports the Development Commission's position against the Wildlife Commission's position.\n4. Choice C states that regulation should only be implemented when it's found that development has actually reduced endangered species populations. This aligns with the Development Commission's argument that Figorian development might not affect wildlife and should be allowed.\n5. The other choices do not directly support the Development Commission's position:\n   - A and B suggest international regulation and prioritizing wildlife preservation, which goes against the Development Commission's stance.\n   - D argues against allowing different degrees of environmental harm by different nations, contrary to the Development Commission's point.\n   - E simply states it's imprudent to deplete resources further, without specifically supporting the Development Commission's argument.\nTherefore, Choice C most strongly supports the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
