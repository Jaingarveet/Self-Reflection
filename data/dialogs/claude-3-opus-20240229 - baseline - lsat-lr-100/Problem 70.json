Arnot argues that fundamental changes in government would virtually eliminate our most vexing social ills.\n2. However, this conclusion is false because Arnot's argument depends on the dubious assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public.\nNow, let's examine each answer choice:\nA: The subscriber does not merely repudiate Arnot's claim because of an inadequate argument. They provide a specific reason why the argument is flawed - the dubious assumption about government trustworthiness.\nB: The subscriber does not discuss any changes that are required for virtual elimination of social ills or suggest that such changes would guarantee the elimination of those ills.\nC: The subscriber does not discuss the truth or falsity of the assumptions used in Arnot's argument, only the dubiousness of one specific assumption.\nD: The subscriber does not appear to distort Arnot's argument. They directly address the conclusion and a key assumption.\nE: The subscriber uses \"government\" consistently throughout their argument. There is no apparent shift in the meaning of the term.\nThe best answer is A. The subscriber's main flaw is rejecting Arnot's conclusion solely on the basis that Arnot's argument for it relies on a dubious assumption. Even if the assumption is dubious, that alone does not prove the conclusion false.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
