        "content": "Let's analyze the argument step-by-step:\n1. The argument states that people become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe:\n   a) Important problems can only be addressed by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes, and\n   b) Such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action.\n2. The argument concludes that the decreasing voter turnout is entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems.\n3. The argument assumes that the belief mentioned in point 1 is the sole cause of decreasing voter turnout, without considering other possible factors.\n4. The argument does not provide justification for this assumption, making it vulnerable to criticism.\n5. Choice A directly points out this vulnerability by stating that the argument \"presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action.\"\nTherefore, choice A is the most appropriate criticism of the political scientist's argument.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
