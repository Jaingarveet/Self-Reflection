The reasons given are:\n   - Pluto has an atmosphere and is larger than any asteroid.\n   - Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune.\n   - Pluto was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity.\n3. For the conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated assumption that connects these reasons to the conclusion.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   - A is not assumed; the argument doesn't mention moons.\n   - B is implied by the argument, but it's not necessary for the conclusion.\n   - C is not directly relevant to the conclusion.\n   - D is not assumed; the argument mentions Pluto's size.\n   - E provides the missing link: if a true planet must have formed in orbit around the sun, and Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune, then Pluto is not a true planet.\nTherefore, E is the assumption that makes the conclusion follow logically.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
