Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives?\nChoices:\n  A: More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once.\n  B: There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers.\n  C: The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.\n  D: Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.\n  E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.\n"

TV shows make profits from sponsors who are primarily interested in the purchasing power of the viewers. This means that the quality and demographics of the audience are more important than the total number of viewers. In contrast, movie profits come directly from ticket sales, so the number of viewers is the primary concern for movie executives.\nE: The fact that many popular TV shows are free to watch doesn't directly explain the difference in goals between movie and TV executives.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
