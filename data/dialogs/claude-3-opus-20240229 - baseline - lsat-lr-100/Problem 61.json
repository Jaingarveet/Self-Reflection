The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\n"

Having the same number of people in each group helps establish a fair comparison.\nB: The group of researchers answering the calls should not impact the participants' ability to remember to make the calls at the specified time.\nC: Knowing that there were no persons over 40 years old in the college student group helps establish that the two groups had distinct age ranges, which is important for comparing memory performance between older and younger individuals.\nD: Both groups having unrestricted access to telephones is important to ensure that any lapses were due to memory issues and not external factors like lack of phone access.\nE: Receiving instructions at approximately the same time before the calls helps ensure that both groups had a similar amount of time to remember the task, which is important for a fair comparison.\nAmong these choices, B is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. The group of researchers answering the calls does not directly impact the participants' memory performance or the comparison between the two age groups.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
