It then says that no one who knows him will be surprised that he is offended by suggestions of unethical behavior.\n3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an assumed connection between being self-righteous and being easily offended by accusations of unethical behavior.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   - A, B, and C are not necessary assumptions for the conclusion. They introduce new ideas not mentioned in the passage.\n   - D is not necessary. Whether Ellsworth is actually innocent or not doesn't affect whether people would expect him to be offended.\n   - E directly states the assumed connection: that self-righteous people are expected to be easily offended.\n5. Therefore, E is the necessary assumption for the conclusion to follow logically.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
