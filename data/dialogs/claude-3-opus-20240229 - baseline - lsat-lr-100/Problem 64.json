Shedding tears removes these hormones from the body.\n3. The argument concludes that crying must reduce emotional stress.\nThe argument assumes that because tears contain stress hormones, shedding tears is sufficient to reduce emotional stress. However, it overlooks the possibility that the reduction in stress, if it occurs, might be due to factors other than the removal of hormones through tears.\nFor example, the act of crying itself, regardless of the shedding of tears, might have a cathartic effect that reduces stress. Alternatively, the social support or empathy that people often receive when they cry could be the primary factor in reducing stress.\nThe argument confuses a condition that is necessary for the production of a phenomenon (the presence of stress hormones in tears) with a condition that is sufficient to cause that phenomenon (the reduction of stress).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
