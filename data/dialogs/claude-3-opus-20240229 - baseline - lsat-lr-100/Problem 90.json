They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.\n2. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.\n3. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.\n4. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\nA. This is not supported. The passage does not state that all objects without lithium are stars with less mass than the Sun. Brown dwarfs could potentially have no lithium for other reasons.\nB. This is not supported. The passage states that stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium due to incomplete mixing, but it does not say that all objects with lithium have incompletely mixed nuclear furnaces.\nC. This is strongly supported. The passage states that brown dwarfs do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces, so their lithium cannot be consumed. Therefore, if an object has no lithium, it cannot be a brown dwarf.\nD. This is not supported. The passage does not make any claims about all objects with lithium being more massive than the Sun.\nE. This is not supported. The passage does not discuss objects less massive than brown dwarfs.\nTherefore, choice C is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
