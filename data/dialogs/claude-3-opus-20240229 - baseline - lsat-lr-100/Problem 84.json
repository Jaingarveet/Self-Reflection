They conclude that the overabundance of algae must be harmful to the smaller fish.\nThe argument assumes a causal relationship between the algae and fish deaths, but it doesn't consider alternative explanations.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. The argument doesn't compare the effects on smaller vs. larger fish, so this isn't the main weakness.\nB. The argument is specific to this pond, so the effects in larger bodies of water aren't relevant.\nC. The argument doesn't consider different effects based on fish size, but this isn't the main flaw.\nD. This points out a key weakness - the argument doesn't consider that both the algae and fish deaths could be caused by something else, like high temperatures or pollution.\nE. The argument is about overabundance, not below-normal amounts, of algae.\nTherefore, the best answer is D. The argument ignores the possibility that the algae and fish deaths are independent effects of a common cause.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
