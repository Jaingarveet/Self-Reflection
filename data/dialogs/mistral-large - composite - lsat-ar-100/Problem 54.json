        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the distribution of plays among the students.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.\nI knew the correct conditions but made an incorrect inference.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Inference error\nSolution:\nSince Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.\nSince neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, they cannot review the play Jiang reviews.\nSince Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.\nSince exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review the same play as either Kramer or O'Neill.\nTherefore, Megregian must review Tamerlane.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.\n2. Identify the plays that each student can or cannot review based on the conditions.\n3. Identify the minimum and maximum number of plays each student can review based on the conditions.\n4. Identify the plays that must be reviewed by at least two students based on the conditions.\n5. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.\n6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your logical conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given conditions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a systematic process that requires careful analysis and deduction.\n"
