Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday.

At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nNow let's analyze each choice:\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible, as it does not violate any conditions.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This cannot be true, as Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible, as it does not violate any conditions.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This cannot be true, as exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, not Wednesday.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible, as it does not violate any conditions.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand the conditions given.\n2. Analyze each choice and determine whether it violates any of the conditions.\n3. Eliminate any choices that violate the conditions.\n4. Choose the answer that cannot be true based on the conditions given.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the problem carefully and make sure you understand the conditions given.\n* Be sure to consider all possible scenarios when analyzing each choice.\n* Eliminate any choices that violate the conditions given.\n* Double-check your work to make sure you have not made any errors in your analysis.\n* Trust your analysis and choose the answer that cannot be true based on the conditions given.\n"
