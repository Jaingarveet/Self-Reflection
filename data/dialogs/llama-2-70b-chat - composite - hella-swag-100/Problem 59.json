Either way, do this in a style that shows you're only clowning around and want her to participate-she'll hopefully get the gist and engage.\n  C: Touch her shoulder and tell her that you desire to capture her attention. You could say, \" i know you've been thinking we've been talking about this, but let's get your mind on the night \".\n  D: Initiate the fight by turning on your lights.
