Analyze the conditions:\n   * Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.\n   * Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.\n   * Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 (but not both).\n   * Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2 (but not both).\n   * There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n2. Consider possible scenarios:\n   * Zone 1: Parra or Tiao\n   * Zone 2: Tiao or Udall\n   * Zone 3: Kim, Mahr, [Parra or Tiao], [Stuckey or Udall] (3 representatives)\n3. Identify restrictions:\n   * Quinn cannot work in the same zone as Parra (as they work together).\n   * Stuckey cannot work in the same zone as Udall (as they work together).\n4. Evaluate options:\n   * A: Kim - No restriction, Kim could work in any zone.\n   * B: Mahr - No restriction, Mahr could work in any zone.\n   * C: Stuckey - Stuckey cannot work in the same zone as Udall, so they cannot work in Zone 3 together.\n   * D: Tiao - Tiao could potentially work in Zone 3 with Kim and Mahr.\n   * E: Udall - Udall could potentially work in Zone 3 with Kim and Mahr.\n5. Conclusion:\n   Quinn cannot work in the same zone as Stuckey (Option C).\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
