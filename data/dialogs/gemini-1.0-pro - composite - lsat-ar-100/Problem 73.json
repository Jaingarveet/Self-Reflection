The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

This eliminates option D, which states that Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n3. **Analyze the remaining options:**\n    * Option C: Jiang reviews Undulation. This is possible, as Jiang does not review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviews.\n    * Option E: O'Neill reviews Sunset. This is also possible, as O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and could review Sunset as well.\n**Therefore, both options C and E could be true.**\n**Action:** Answer(\"C and E\")"
