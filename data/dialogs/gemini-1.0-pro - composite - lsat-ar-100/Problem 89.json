Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **\"The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\"** This condition was not considered in my previous attempt.\n* **\"The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\"** This condition was also not considered.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Monday:** At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the only option for Monday is the first batch of oatmeal cookies.\n2. **Tuesday:** The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because it would be the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This leaves the second batch of peanut butter cookies for Tuesday.\n3. **Wednesday:** The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, as mentioned above.\n4. **Thursday:** The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n5. **Friday:** Since only one batch is made on Friday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is already made, the only option is the third batch of oatmeal cookies.\n**Answer:**\nC: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n**Reflection:**\nI made the mistake of not considering all the given conditions in my previous attempt. By carefully analyzing the conditions and following a step-by-step approach, I was able to arrive at the correct answer this time. \n"
