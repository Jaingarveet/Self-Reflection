I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Thought:**\n* J must be shown in the evening.\n* K cannot be shown in the morning.\n* L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n**Step 1: Determine the possible order of houses shown in the evening.**\nSince J must be shown in the evening, there are two possibilities:\n* J is shown first, followed by another house.\n* J is shown second, preceded by another house.\n**Step 2: Analyze the constraints for K and L.**\n* K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n* L must be shown after K and before M.\n**Step 3: Consider the possible scenarios.**\n**Scenario 1: J is shown first in the evening.**\nIn this scenario, K and L could be shown in the afternoon, followed by M in the evening. However, this would violate the constraint that L must be shown before M. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n**Scenario 2: J is shown second in the evening.**\nIn this scenario, K and L could be shown in the morning, followed by M in the afternoon. This would satisfy all the constraints.\n**Step 4: Identify the statement that must be true.**\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that must be true is:\n**C: L is shown in the evening.**\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")**"
