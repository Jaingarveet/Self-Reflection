The advice reminds me to be cautious when squaring equations and to check for extraneous solutions.\nLet's solve the equation step-by-step:\n1. **Square both sides:**  Squaring both sides gives us $4x = (x-3)^2$ which simplifies to $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$.\n2. **Factor the quadratic:** This factors to $(x-1)(x-9) = 0$.\n3. **Solve for x:** This gives us two possible solutions, $x=1$ and $x=9$.\n4. **Check for extraneous solutions:** \n    - Substituting $x=1$ into the original equation gives $\\sqrt{4} = -2$, which is not true. So, $x=1$ is extraneous.\n    - Substituting $x=9$ into the original equation gives $\\sqrt{36} = 6$, which is true.\nTherefore, only $x=9$ is a valid solution.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
