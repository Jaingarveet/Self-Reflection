However, I failed to consider the possibility that Robot 1 could be Type C (recognizes neither) and simply picked up the red squares by chance.\n**Correct Answer:** D\n**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**\n* **Robot 1:** Since it picked up the red squares instead of the red balls, it cannot be Type A (recognizes colors).\n* **Robot 2:** Since it picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls, it cannot be Type B (recognizes shapes).\nTherefore, the only possibility is that **No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.**\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\") \n"
