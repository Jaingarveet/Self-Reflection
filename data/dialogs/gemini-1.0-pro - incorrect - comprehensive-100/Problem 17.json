This assumption is crucial for the argument's conclusion that the psychological theory is untenable.\n**Key takeaway:** Pay close attention to the assumptions underlying the argument, not just the explicit statements.\n## Applying the lesson to the current question:\nThe argument claims that the psychological theory is untenable because great painters often experience loneliness. This implies that the theory assumes a positive correlation between intimate relationships and happiness. Therefore, the most likely assumption is:\n**B: People with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness.**\nThis assumption is crucial for the argument's conclusion. If it were not true, the fact that great painters experience loneliness would not necessarily contradict the theory.\n## Action: Answer(\"B\")"
