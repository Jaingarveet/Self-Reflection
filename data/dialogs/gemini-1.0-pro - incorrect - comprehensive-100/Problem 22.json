Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

In this case, Helen and Irving would give reports on Wednesday.\n**B: Nina gives a report on Monday:** This is not possible because Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, and if she gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Tuesday, which would conflict with George's report.\n**C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday:** This is not possible because Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday, and if she gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which would conflict with George's report.\n**D: Olivia gives a report on Monday:** This is not possible because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.\n**E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday:** This is possible if Nina gives a report on Monday and George gives a report on Tuesday. In this case, Robert would give a report on Wednesday.\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, the only possible scenario is **A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.**\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
