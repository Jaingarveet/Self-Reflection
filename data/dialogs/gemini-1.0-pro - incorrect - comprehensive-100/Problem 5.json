I will try my best to answer this question correctly.\n**Thought:**\n* The sum of an arithmetic progression (AP) is the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last terms.\n* We know the sum of the ages of all members is 250.\n* We know the youngest member is 7 years old.\n* We know the common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years.\n**Solution:**\n1. Let x be the number of members in the club.\n2. The average age of the members is (7 + (x-1) * 0.25) / 2.\n3. The sum of the ages of all members is x * (7 + (x-1) * 0.25) / 2.\n4. We know this sum is 250, so we can set up the equation: x * (7 + (x-1) * 0.25) / 2 = 250.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get: x^2 + 6x - 2000 = 0.\n6. Factoring the equation, we get: (x-40)(x+50) = 0.\n7. Therefore, x = 40 or x = -50.\n8. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 40.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
