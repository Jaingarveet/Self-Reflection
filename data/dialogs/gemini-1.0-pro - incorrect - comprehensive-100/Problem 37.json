While some individuals may be allergic to certain breeds of cats but not others, this is not always the case. The specific proteins that cause allergies can vary from person to person, and a person may be allergic to multiple breeds.\n* **B**: This statement is **strongly supported** by the information provided. The passage explicitly states that \"no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\"\n* **C**: This statement is true, but it is not the most strongly supported. While the passage mentions that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary from cat to cat, it does not emphasize this point as strongly as the fact that no cat can trigger allergies in all individuals.\n* **D**: This statement is not necessarily true. The passage does not provide information about the intensity of allergic reactions in different individuals.\n* **E**: This statement is true, but it is not the most strongly supported. While the passage mentions that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary from cat to cat, it does not emphasize this point as strongly as the fact that no cat can trigger allergies in all individuals.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the information provided, the statement that is most strongly supported is **B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.**\n## Action: Answer(\"B\")"
