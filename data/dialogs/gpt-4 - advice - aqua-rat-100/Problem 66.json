The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years. \nThe sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. \nWe can set up the equation: 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25), and solve for n.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
