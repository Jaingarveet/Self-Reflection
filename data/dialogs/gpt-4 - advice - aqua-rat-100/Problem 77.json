This simplifies to 5n + 20. \nThis sum, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. So, 5n + 20 = 10k, where k is a perfect square. Simplifying this gives n = 2k - 4. \nThe only possible values of n that are two-digit odd numbers and satisfy this equation are 41, 47, and 67. \nSo, the possible answers are A, C, and D. \nHowever, the sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting with 41, 47, or 67 divided by 10 does not result in a perfect square. \nTherefore, none of the options are correct. \nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
