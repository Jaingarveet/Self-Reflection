While I correctly remembered the folic acid dose of 500 mcg, I mistakenly thought the iron dose was 60 mg instead of the correct 100 mg. This error was due to a gap in my knowledge of the specific dosage recommendations.\nError Keywords:\n- Incorrect recall\n- Dosage error\n- Iron supplementation error\n- Maternal health recommendation error\nSolution:\nUnder the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) program, pregnant women are given daily iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anemia and neural tube defects in the developing fetus.\nThe recommended daily dose for pregnant women is 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 mcg of folic acid.\nThis combination is essential for the proper growth and development of the fetus and the well-being of the mother.\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Recall that the MCH program provides iron and folic acid supplements to pregnant women.\n2. Remember that the purpose of these supplements is to prevent anemia and neural tube defects.\n3. Memorize the correct daily dosage: 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 mcg of folic acid.\n4. When answering questions about the MCH program's iron and folic acid supplementation, always double-check the dosage values.\n5. Select the answer choice that matches the correct daily dosage of 100 mg iron and 500 mcg folic acid.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to numerical values, especially when dealing with dosages or other quantitative information.\n- When unsure about specific details, take a moment to recall the context and purpose of the topic at hand.\n- Regularly review and reinforce your knowledge of important facts, figures, and recommendations related to your field of expertise.\n- If you encounter a question that requires specific knowledge, take the time to carefully consider each answer choice before making a selection.\n- In the context of maternal and child health, always prioritize the well-being of both the mother and the developing fetus.\n"

The correct daily dose of folic acid is 500 mcg, which I remembered correctly in the previous attempt.\n5. Looking at the answer choices, only one option matches the correct combination of 100 mg iron and 500 mcg folic acid.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: 100 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
