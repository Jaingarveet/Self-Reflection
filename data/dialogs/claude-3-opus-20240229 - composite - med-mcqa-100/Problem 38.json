While posterior urethral valves can cause urinary obstruction, the \"cobra head\" sign is actually more characteristic of ureteroceles. I confused the radiologic appearance of these two conditions.\nError Keywords:\n - Radiologic sign confusion\n - Urinary tract anomaly misidentification\n - [REDACTED] vs. ureterocele mix-up\nSolution:\n1. The \"cobra head\" sign is a radiologic finding seen on imaging studies like voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP).\n2. This sign is characterized by a dilated distal ureter that protrudes into the bladder, resembling the head of a cobra snake.\n3. [REDACTED] ureterocele is a congenital anomaly where the distal ureter balloons into the bladder, causing a cystic dilatation.\n4. This cystic dilatation of the distal ureter gives the characteristic \"cobra head\" appearance on imaging.\n5. While posterior urethral valves, rectocele, and bladder tumors can cause urinary tract obstruction, they do not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and note the key radiologic sign mentioned.\n2. Recall the definition and appearance of the radiologic sign.\n3. Consider each answer choice and determine which condition best matches the radiologic sign.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that do not typically present with the mentioned radiologic sign.\n5. Select the answer choice that most closely associates with the given radiologic finding.\nAdvice:\n - Familiarize yourself with common radiologic signs and their associated conditions.\n - When answering questions about radiologic findings, visualize the appearance of each condition.\n - Eliminate answer choices that do not match the key radiologic finding mentioned in the question.\n - If unsure, use the process of elimination to narrow down the possible correct answers.\n - Remember that some radiologic signs are highly specific for certain conditions, while others may be more nonspecific.\n"

The \"cobra head\" sign refers to a dilated distal ureter protruding into the bladder, resembling a cobra's head. This cystic dilatation is characteristic of a ureterocele.\n3. Let's consider each answer choice:\n   A. Rectocele - This is a herniation of the rectum into the vagina. It does not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign on urinary tract imaging.\n   B. Ureterocele - This is a congenital anomaly where the distal ureter balloons into the bladder. The cystic dilatation gives the characteristic \"cobra head\" appearance.\n   C. Posterior urethral valve - While this can cause urinary obstruction, it does not typically show the \"cobra head\" sign. I previously confused this with ureterocele.\n   D. Bladder tumour - Tumors in the bladder do not usually present with the specific \"cobra head\" appearance of a dilated distal ureter.\n4. By the process of elimination and focusing on the key finding, ureterocele (choice B) is the best match for the \"cobra head\" sign.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
