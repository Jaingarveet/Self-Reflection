It can be due to:\nChoices:\n  A: Oligohydramnios\n  B: Placenta pre\n  C: Pelvic tumor\n  D: Uterine anomalies\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that all the listed choices could cause an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida. While oligohydramnios, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies can contribute to an unstable lie, placenta previa is the most likely cause among the given options. I failed to prioritize the most probable cause based on the clinical scenario.\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete clinical reasoning\n- Failure to prioritize probable causes\n- Lack of discrimination between options\n- Insufficient obstetric knowledge\nSolution:\n1. The question presents a case of a multigravida at 34 weeks with an unstable lie.\n2. [REDACTED]via is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervical os.\n3. [REDACTED]via can prevent the fetal head from engaging in the pelvis, leading to an unstable lie.\n4. While other conditions like oligohydramnios, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies can contribute to an unstable lie, placenta previa is the most probable cause among the given options.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]via.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the clinical scenario carefully, noting key information like gestational age and obstetric history.\n2. Identify the main clinical finding or problem, in this case, an unstable lie.\n3. Consider the potential causes of the clinical finding among the given options.\n4. Prioritize the most likely cause based on the clinical scenario and your knowledge of obstetrics.\n5. Eliminate less likely options, even if they can potentially contribute to the clinical finding.\n6. Choose the best answer that fits the given information and the most probable cause.\nAdvice:\n- Always consider the clinical context when answering questions, including patient history and gestational age.\n- Prioritize the most likely diagnoses or causes based on the given scenario.\n- Don't assume all options are equally probable; use your clinical judgment to discriminate between choices.\n- Brush up on your knowledge of obstetric conditions and their impact on fetal position and stability.\n- Eliminate options that are less likely, even if they can potentially contribute to the clinical finding.\n- Focus on the most probable cause among the given choices, rather than trying to find a choice that fits all possible causes.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question presents a case of a multigravida (a woman who has been pregnant more than once) at 34 weeks gestation with an unstable lie. \n2. An unstable lie means the fetal presentation is not fixed and can change position. This is abnormal at 34 weeks when the fetus should be settling into a fixed position, usually head down.\n3. Among the answer choices, placenta previa is the most likely cause of an unstable lie at this stage of pregnancy. Placenta previa is when the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix.\n4. Placenta previa can prevent the fetal head from engaging in the pelvis properly, leading to an unstable lie, especially later in pregnancy.\n5. While oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid), pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies can also potentially cause an unstable lie, they are less likely to be the primary cause compared to placenta previa in this specific clinical scenario.\n6. Therefore, the best answer among the given choices is placenta previa.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
