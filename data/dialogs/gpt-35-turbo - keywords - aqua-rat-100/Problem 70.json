The main line starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. The man wants to catch the first train that comes. \nTo calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find the time interval between the first train's arrival and the time the man arrives at the station. \nLet's assume that the man arrives at the station at a random time between 5.00 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. \nIf the man arrives between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M., he will catch the harbor line train. \nIf the man arrives between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M., he will catch the main line train. \nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of him arriving between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. (for the harbor line train) plus the probability of him arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. (for the main line train). \nThe time interval between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. is 2 minutes. The time interval between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. is 8 minutes. \nThe probability of the man arriving between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. is 2/10 or 0.2. \nThe probability of the man arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. is 8/10 or 0.8. \nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 0.2 + 0.8 = 1. \nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
