Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?\nChoices:\n  A: one\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n"

Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations of lab assistants and sessions:\n\nA) Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.\n\nFrom constraint 4, we know that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Since Olivia leads the Friday session, Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nFrom constraint 1, we know that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Since they are both leading sessions on Thursday, Julio's session cannot meet on that day. Therefore, Julio's session must meet on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's check which lab assistants can be determined to lead which sessions:\n\n* Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, so we know that he leads a session on Wednesday.\n* Since Kevin and Rebecca are leading sessions on the same day, we can determine that they lead sessions on Thursday.\n* Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so we know that they lead sessions on different days. However, we cannot determine which sessions they lead without more information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: two lab assistants can be determined to lead which sessions they lead."
