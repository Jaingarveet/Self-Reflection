The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either\nChoices:\n  A: F or else K\n  B: F or else M\n  C: K or else M\n  D: M or else Q\n  E: P or else Q\n"

Let's use a truth table to keep track of the possible combinations of scientists selected.\n\n| Botanist | Chemist | Zoologist | Panel Composition |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | K | P | F, K, P |\n| F | L | P | F, L, P |\n| F | M | P | F, M, P |\n| G | K | P | G, K, P |\n| G | L | P | G, L, P |\n| G | M | P | G, M, P |\n| H | K | P | H, K, P |\n| H | L | P | H, L, P |\n| H | M | P | H, M, P |\n| K | L | Q | K, L, Q |\n| K | M | Q | K, M, Q |\n| M | L | Q | M, L, Q |\n| M | R | Q | M, R, Q |\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nOption A: If both G and H are selected, the panel must include either F or K.\n\nReason: If G and H are selected, then at most one botanist can be selected (since there are only two botanists). Therefore, the panel must include either F or K, since they are the only two botanists left.\n\nOption B: If both F and K are selected, the panel must include either F or M.\n\nReason: If F and K are selected, then there are only two chemists left (L and M). Therefore, the panel must include either F or M, since they are the only two chemists left.\n\nOption C: If K and M are selected, the panel must include either K or M.\n\nReason: If K and M are selected, then there are only two zoologists left (P and R). Therefore, the panel must include either K or M, since they are the only two zoologists left.\n\nOption D: If M is selected, the panel must include either M or Q.\n\nReason: If M is selected, then there are only two zoologists left (P and R). Therefore, the panel must include either M or Q, since they are the only two zoologists left.\n\nOption E: If P is selected, the panel must include either P or Q.\n\nReason: If P is selected, then there are only two zoologists left (P and R). Therefore, the panel must include either P or Q, since they are the only two zoologists left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: If both F and K are selected, the panel must include either F or M."
