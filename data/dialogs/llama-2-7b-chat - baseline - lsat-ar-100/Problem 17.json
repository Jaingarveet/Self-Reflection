The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?\nChoices:\n  A: day 1 and day 3\n  B: day 2 and day 6\n  C: day 3 and day 5\n  D: day 4 and day 6\n  E: day 5 and day 7\n"

Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.\n4. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of breeds that can be featured on each day:\n\nDay 1: Greyhound (only breed featured on day 1)\nDay 2: None of the above breeds (no breed is featured on day 2)\nDay 3: Himalayan (Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, and day 3 is one of those days)\nDay 4: None of the above breeds (no breed is featured on day 4)\nDay 5: None of the above breeds (no breed is featured on day 5)\nDay 6: Newfoundland (day 6 is the only day that features a breed that is not Rottweiler or Himalayan)\nDay 7: Rottweiler (day 7 is the only day that does not feature Himalayans, and Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the pairs of days that cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy:\n\nA: day 1 and day 3 - Both days feature Greyhounds, but no other breed is featured on both days.\nB: day 2 and day 6 - Both days feature Newfoundlands, but no other breed is featured on both days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) day 1 and day 3."
