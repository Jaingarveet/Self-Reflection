The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n"

Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n* Jiang does not review Tamerlane, as otherwise, Kramer and O'Neill would not both review Tamerlane.\n* Lopez reviews either Sunset or Undulation, as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n* Megregian reviews either Sunset or Tamerlane, as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n* O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Jiang does not review Tamerlane, so Jiang cannot review Sunset.\nB: Lopez reviews Undulation, but this is not consistent with the given conditions.\nC: Megregian does not review Sunset, as Lopez reviews Undulation.\nD: Megregian does not review Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\nE: O'Neill does not review Undulation, as Lopez reviews Undulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Megregian reviews Tamerlane."
