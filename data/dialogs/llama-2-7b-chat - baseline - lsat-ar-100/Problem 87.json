No more than four French works are selected.\n2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected.\n3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.\n4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of works that the organizer can select:\n\nA. One French novel and one French play: This combination is not possible because there are only two French plays.\n\nB. One French novel and one Russian play: This combination is not possible because the requirement states that if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\n\nC. One Russian novel and one French play: This combination is not possible because there are only two French plays.\n\nD. Two French novels: This combination is possible but violates the requirement that no more than four French works are selected.\n\nE. Two Russian novels: This combination is possible but violates the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (D) Two French novels."
