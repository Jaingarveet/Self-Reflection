Therefore, option A is false.\n\nB: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n\nSince G is placed on the middle shelf, K cannot be placed on a higher shelf than G. Therefore, option B is false.\n\nC: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n\nSince F is placed on the bottom shelf, I cannot be placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, option C is false.\n\nD: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n\nSince O is placed on the top shelf, G cannot be placed on a higher shelf than O. Therefore, option D is false.\n\nE: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\nSince L is placed on the bottom shelf, F cannot be placed on a higher shelf than L.
