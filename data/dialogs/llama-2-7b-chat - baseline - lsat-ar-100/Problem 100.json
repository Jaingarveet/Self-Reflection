T is performed immediately before F (O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H).\n2. Two compositions are performed after F and before R (O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H).\n3. O is performed either first or fifth (O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H).\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H (O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H).\n5. P is performed at some time before S (O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H).\n6. At least one composition is performed after O and before S (O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) O, T, P, F, R, S, L, H."
