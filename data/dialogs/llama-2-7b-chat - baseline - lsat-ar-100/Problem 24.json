The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nThe question is: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?\n\nLet's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.\nThis choice would not have the same effect as the original constraint. If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, Jaramillo could still be assigned to a different ambassadorship, violating the constraint.\n\nB: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\nThis choice would also not have the same effect as the original constraint. If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, Novetzke could still be assigned to a different ambassadorship, violating the constraint.\n\nC: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\nThis choice would have the same effect as the original constraint. If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne would be assigned to an ambassadorship, satisfying the constraint.\n\nD: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nThis choice would have the same effect as the original constraint. If Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships, then the constraint is satisfied.\n\nE: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nThis choice would have the same effect as the original constraint. If Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships, then the constraint is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C): If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship."
