The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\n"

Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can conclude that:\n\n* Kramer and O'Neill are the only two students who review Tamerlane.\n* Jiang does not review Tamerlane.\n* Lopez does not review Tamerlane.\n* Megregian reviews at least one play that Kramer and Lopez do not review.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of students who review Tamerlane:\n\n1. Kramer and O'Neill: This is the only combination that satisfies all the conditions.\n2. Kramer and Lopez: This combination does not satisfy condition 3, as Lopez reviews more plays than Kramer.\n3. Kramer and Megregian: This combination does not satisfy condition 2, as Megregian does not review any play that Kramer reviews.\n4. O'Neill and Megregian: This combination does not satisfy condition 1, as O'Neill does not review Tamerlane.\n5. Lopez and Megregian: This combination does not satisfy condition 2, as Lopez reviews more plays than Megregian.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
