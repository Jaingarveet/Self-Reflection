Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\n"

Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of lab assistants leading sessions:\n\n1. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions: This means that Julio's session will meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning, and Kevin's session will meet on the same day.\n2. Lan leads an afternoon session: This means that Lan's session will meet on either Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoon.\n3. Nessa leads an afternoon session: This means that Nessa's session will meet on either Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoon.\n4. Olivia's session meets on Thursday morning: This means that Olivia's session will meet on Thursday morning, and Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\nA: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning. This is not possible because Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Kevin and Rebecca's sessions.\n\nB: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon. This is not possible because Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Nessa's session.\n\nC: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon. This is not possible because Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and Friday is the last day of the three days.\n\nD: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning. This is not possible because Olivia's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Julio's session, and Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning.\n\nE: Olivia's session meets Friday morning. This is not possible because Olivia's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Julio's session, and Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Olivia's session meets Friday morning."
