Each bay holds a different type of cargo, which are:\n\n1. Fuel\n2. Grain\n3. Livestock\n4. Machinery\n5. Produce\n6. Textiles\n\nFrom the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n\n* The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.\n* The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n* The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n* The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of cargo for the first three bays (Bay 1 to Bay 3):\n\n1. Bay 1: Grain (higher number than livestock)\n2. Bay 2: Livestock (higher number than textiles)\n3. Bay 3: Produce (higher number than fuel)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"A: fuel, machinery, textiles\")"
