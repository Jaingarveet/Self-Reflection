Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target\n  B: Solide's website target\n  C: Solide's voicemail target\n  D: Truvest's website target\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target\n"

None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n\nFrom condition 1, we can conclude that Image's website target cannot be longer than 2 days.\n\nFrom condition 2, we can conclude that Image's voicemail target must be 2 days or shorter.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Image's voicemail target - This cannot be 2 days since it must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n\nB. Solide's website target - This cannot be 2 days since Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nC. Solide's voicemail target - This cannot be 2 days since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n\nD. Truvest's website target - This cannot be 2 days since Truvest's voicemail target must be shorter than Image's voicemail target.\n\nE. Truvest's voicemail target - This cannot be 2 days since Truvest's voicemail target must be shorter than Image's voicemail target.\n\nTherefore, the only option that can be 2 days is:\n\nB. Solide's website target.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
