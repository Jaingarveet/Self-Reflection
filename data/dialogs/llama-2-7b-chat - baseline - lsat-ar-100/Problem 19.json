Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\n"

        "content": "  Thought: Let's analyze the conditions given in the problem:\n\n1. George can give a report on Tuesday, so there are 7 students who can give reports on Tuesday.\n2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so there are 5 students who can give afternoon reports.\n3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of students giving reports:\n\n1. Monday: Helen, Kyle, and Lenore can give reports.\n2. Tuesday: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina can give reports.\n3. Wednesday: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina can give reports.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Helen gives a report on Monday: This is not possible since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore are the only ones who can give reports on Monday.\nB. Irving gives a report on Monday: This is also not possible since Irving, Kyle, and Lenore are the only ones who can give reports on Monday.\nC. Irving gives a report on Wednesday: This is possible since Irving can give a report on Wednesday, but it is not the only possibility.\nD. Kyle gives a report on Tuesday: This is not possible since Kyle can only give a report on Wednesday.\nE. Kyle gives a report on Wednesday: This is possible since Kyle can give a report on Wednesday, but it is not the only possibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Irving gives a report on Wednesday."
