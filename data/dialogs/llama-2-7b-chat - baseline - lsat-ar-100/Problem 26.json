Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\n"

Therefore, the first solo will be either a modern piece performed by Wayne or a traditional piece performed by Zara.\n\nIn the second solo, Zara will perform a traditional piece, so the third solo must be a modern piece performed by Wayne.\n\nIn the fourth solo, either Wayne or Zara can perform a traditional piece, but since Wayne has already performed a modern piece in the third solo, Zara must perform a traditional piece in the fourth solo.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is 2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
