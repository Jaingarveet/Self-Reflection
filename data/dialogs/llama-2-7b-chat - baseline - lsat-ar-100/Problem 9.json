Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n"

        "content": "  Thought: Based on the given rules, we need to assign parking spaces to the six new employees in a way that no two employees are assigned the same parking space and that Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the possible assignments of parking spaces to the six employees:\n\n1. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so let's assign him parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n2. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so let's assign him parking space #5 or #6.\n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so let's assign him parking space #1 or #2.\n4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so let's assign him parking space #3 or #4.\n5. Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, so let's assign him parking space #2 or #3.\n6. Vaughn is not mentioned in the problem statement, so let's assume he is assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n\nNow, let's check which one of the given options could be true:\n\nOption A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nThis is not possible since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, and parking space #1 is the lowest-numbered parking space.\n\nOption B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nThis is possible since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and parking space #2 is a higher-numbered parking space.\n\nOption C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nThis is not possible since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and parking space #3 is a lower-numbered parking space.\n\nOption D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nThis is possible since Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, and parking space #3 is a lower-numbered parking space.\n\nOption E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nThis is not possible since Vaughn is not mentioned in the problem statement, and parking space #4 is not assigned to any of the six employees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: Young is assigned parking space #2."
