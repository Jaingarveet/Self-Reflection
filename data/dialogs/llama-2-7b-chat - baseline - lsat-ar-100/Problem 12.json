J, K - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening.\n2. J, M - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because M must be shown after L is shown, and L must be shown before M.\n3. J, O - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because O cannot be shown in the afternoon.\n4. J, P - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because P must be shown after J is shown, and J must be shown in the evening.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: J, K - Incorrect. This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\nB: J, M - Incorrect. This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\nC: J, O - Incorrect.
