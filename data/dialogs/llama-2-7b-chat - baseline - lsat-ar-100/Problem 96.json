The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Manx are featured on day 3.\n  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.\n  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.\n  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.\n"
