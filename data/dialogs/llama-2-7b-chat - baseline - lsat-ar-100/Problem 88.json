At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n"

More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\nA: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince I is placed on the middle shelf, and M is placed on the same shelf as F, which is placed on the bottom shelf, it means that I and M are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, option A is false.\n\nB: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and G is placed on the top shelf, it means that K and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, option B is false.\n\nC: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince L is placed on the bottom shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M, which is placed on the bottom shelf, it means that L and F are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, option C is false.\n\nD: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince M is placed on the bottom shelf and H is placed on the same shelf as O, which is placed on a higher shelf than L, it means that M and H are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, option D is false.\n\nE: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince H is placed on the bottom shelf and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, it means that H and O are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, option E is false.\n\nConclusion: None of the options are true, which means that the position of each book on the shelf is not fully determined by the given conditions."
