The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.\n  B: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.\n  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.\n  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.\n"

Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.\n4. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of breeds that could be featured on each day:\n\nDay 1: Greyhounds are featured, so no other breed can be featured on this day.\nDay 2: No breed is featured on this day, as no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\nDay 3: Himalayans are featured on this day, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on this day.\nDay 4: No breed is featured on this day, as no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\nDay 5: Greyhounds are featured on this day, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on this day.\nDay 6: Rottweilers are featured on this day, so Himalayans cannot be featured on this day.\nDay 7: Himalayans are not featured on this day, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on this day.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\nA: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5, but this is not possible as Greyhounds are already featured on day 1.\nB: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3, but this is not possible as Rottweilers are featured on day 6.\nC: Rottweilers are featured on day 6, but this is not possible as Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.\nD: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3, but this is not possible as Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.\nE: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days, but this is not possible as Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Rottweilers are featured only on day 3."
