Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?\nChoices:\n  A: George and Lenore\n  B: Helen and Nina\n  C: Irving and Robert\n  D: Kyle and Nina\n  E: Olivia and Kyle\n"

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Wednesday), Helen and Irving must give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of students who can give reports on the same day:\n\nDay 1 (Monday):\n\n* George and Lenore can give reports together.\n* Helen and Nina can give reports together.\n* Kyle and Olivia can give reports together.\n\nDay 2 (Tuesday):\n\n* George and Lenore can give reports together.\n* Helen and Nina cannot give reports together (as Nina cannot give an afternoon report).\n* Kyle and Olivia cannot give reports together (as Olivia cannot give an afternoon report).\n\nDay 3 (Wednesday):\n\n* Irving and Robert can give reports together (as neither of them can give an afternoon report).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each pair of students to determine which pair must give reports on Wednesday:\n\n1. George and Lenore: They can give reports together on Monday or Wednesday.\n2. Helen and Nina: They cannot give reports together on Monday or Tuesday (as Nina cannot give an afternoon report), so they must give reports together on Wednesday.\n3. Kyle and Olivia: They cannot give reports together on Monday or Tuesday (as Olivia cannot give an afternoon report), so they must give reports together on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Helen and Nina."
