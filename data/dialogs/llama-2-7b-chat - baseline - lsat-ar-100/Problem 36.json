Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.\n  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.\n  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.\n"

Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test a different bicycle on the first day.\n3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Theresa must test H on the first day.\n4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of riders and bicycles:\n\nDay 1:\n\n* Reynaldo tests G\n* Seamus tests H\n* Theresa tests J\n* Yuki tests F\n\nDay 2:\n\n* Reynaldo does not test F, so he must test a different bicycle. Let's say he tests G.\n* Seamus tests H, as he tested it on the first day.\n* Theresa tests J, as she tested it on the first day.\n* Yuki tests the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which is F.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA) Reynaldo tests G on the second day: This is possible since Reynaldo tested G on the first day.\nB) Seamus tests H on the first day: This is not possible since Seamus tested H on the first day.\nC) Yuki tests H on the second day: This is not possible since Yuki tested H on the first day.\nD) Seamus is one of the testers for J: This is not possible since Seamus tested H on the first day.\nE) Theresa is one of the testers for G: This is not possible since Theresa tested J on the first day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Reynaldo tests G on the second day."
