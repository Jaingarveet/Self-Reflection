The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\n"

Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can conclude that Jiang does not review Sunset, as he reviews Tamerlane along with Kramer.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\nA) Lopez - Does not review Sunset as per condition 1.\nB) O'Neill - Does not review Sunset as per condition 3.\nC) Jiang, Lopez - Both do not review Sunset as per condition 2.\nD) Kramer, O'Neill - Both review Tamerlane, so they do not review Sunset.\nE) Lopez, Megregian - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews Sunset, so this option is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review only Sunset is:\n\nAnswer(\"D\") Kramer, O'Neill."
