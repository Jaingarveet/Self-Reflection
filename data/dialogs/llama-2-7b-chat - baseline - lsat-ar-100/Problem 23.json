Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina\n  B: Lenore, George, and Irving\n  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore\n  D: Robert, George, and Irving\n  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore\n"

Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so George will give a morning report on Tuesday.\n2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so neither of them will give a morning report on Wednesday.\n3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports.\n\nNow, let's apply these conditions to the choices:\n\nA) Irving, Lenore, and Nina: Irving cannot give a morning report on Monday, as Nina will give a report that day. Lenore cannot give a morning report on Tuesday, as George will give a report that day. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nB) Lenore, George, and Irving: Lenore cannot give a morning report on Monday, as Irving will give a report that day. George cannot give a morning report on Tuesday, as Kyle will give a report that day. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nC) Nina, Irving, and Lenore: Nina cannot give a morning report on Monday, as Irving will give a report that day. Irving cannot give a morning report on Tuesday, as Kyle will give a report that day. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nD) Robert, George, and Irving: Robert cannot give a morning report on Monday, as Irving will give a report that day. George cannot give a morning report on Tuesday, as Kyle will give a report that day. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nE) Robert, Irving, and Lenore: Robert cannot give a morning report on Monday, as Irving will give a report that day. Irving cannot give a morning report on Tuesday, as Kyle will give a report that day. Therefore, this option is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
