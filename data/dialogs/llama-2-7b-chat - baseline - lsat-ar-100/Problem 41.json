Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.\n  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n"

Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test a different bicycle on the second day.\n3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she must test H on the first day.\n4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of riders and bicycles:\n\nDay 1:\n\n* Reynaldo tests G or H or J\n* Yuki tests F or H or J\n* Seamus tests F or G or H\n* Theresa tests H\n\nDay 2:\n\n* Reynaldo tests G or H or J (cannot test F)\n* Yuki tests F or H or J (cannot test J)\n* Seamus tests F or G or H (tested F on Day 1)\n* Theresa tests H (tested H on Day 1)\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Reynaldo tests H on the first day, which is not possible since Theresa must test H on the first day.\n\nB: Reynaldo tests J on the first day, which is not possible since Yuki cannot test J.\n\nC: Theresa tests H on the second day, which is not possible since Theresa tested H on the first day.\n\nD: Theresa tests J on the first day, which is not possible since Yuki cannot test J.\n\nE: Yuki tests H on the second day, which is not possible since Yuki tested H on the first day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): Theresa tests H on the second day."
