Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n\n1.

Garcia cannot be the only witness to testify on Monday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the choices:\n\nA: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Franco cannot testify on Monday.\n\nB: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\nThis choice is also incorrect because Franco and Iturbe cannot testify on the same day.\n\nC: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Garcia and Hong cannot both testify on Tuesday.\n\nD: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Garcia cannot be the only witness to testify on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday.\n\nE: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Jackson cannot testify on Tuesday, and two witnesses cannot testify on Monday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D)."
