So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.\nQuestion: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners\n  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog\n  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city\n  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood\n  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the assumption that the argument was based on the breed of the dog, rather than the licensing behavior of the dog owners.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in law but in critical thinking and reasoning.\nI misunderstood the argument and did not consider the importance of licensing behavior in evaluating the argument.\n"
