Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n2. Identify the topic of the question (in this case, sedimentary rock formation).\n3. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.\n4. Identify the first step in the process.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the first step in the process.\n6. State your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")'.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n - Always follow the correct format for providing your answer.\n - Always double-check your answer before submitting it.\n - Always review the basic concepts and processes related to the topic of the question.\n - Always break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n - Always think through each step of the problem-solving process before choosing an answer.\n - Always double-check your work to ensure accuracy.\n"
