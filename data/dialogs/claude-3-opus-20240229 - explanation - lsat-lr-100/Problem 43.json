Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the assumption as being that people should not make promises to do something outside their control. While this is stated in the argument, it is not the key assumption needed for the conclusion to follow. The conclusion that \"love\" should not be taken to refer to feelings relies on the unstated assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical. I failed to recognize this implicit premise in the argument.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The ethicist argues that if \"love\" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love \"until death do us part\" makes no sense. This is because feelings are not within one's control.\n2. The ethicist then concludes that \"love\" in this context should not be taken to refer to feelings. \n3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated assumption. The question is asking us to identify that assumption.\n4. Looking at the answer choices, (D) stands out: \"Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\" This fits with the ethicist's reasoning.\n5. The ethicist is essentially saying: If we interpret \"love\" as feelings, then the promise makes no sense. Therefore, we should not interpret \"love\" that way. The hidden premise is that we should avoid interpreting promises in a way that makes them nonsensical.\n6. The other answer choices, while potentially valid statements, are not necessary assumptions for the ethicist's argument to work.\nTherefore, the assumption that allows the conclusion to follow logically is (D): Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
