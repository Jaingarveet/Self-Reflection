Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\nQuestion: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.\n  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.\n  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.\n  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified argument [REDACTED] as having the same flaw as the original argument. While [REDACTED] does have flawed reasoning, it is not the same flaw as the original. I failed to recognize that argument [REDACTED] actually contains the same logical flaw as the original argument.\n"

This is not necessarily true.\nLooking at each choice:\nA) This argument assumes causation from correlation. The flaw is different from the original.\nB) This one does not assume that because most A are B and most B are C, that most A are C. The reasoning is sound.\nC) This one also does not make the same flawed assumption as the original. It reasons that people who don't want to drive fast generally won't buy sports cars, which makes sense.\nD) This argument follows the same flawed pattern as the original. It assumes that because most nature photographers find portraits boring, and most portrait photographers enjoy photographing dignitaries, then most nature photographers must find photographing dignitaries boring. But this is not a logically sound conclusion, just like the original argument.\nE) This one also does not make the same assumption. The reasoning that snow-removal companies that run lawn-care services in summer would hire more workers in summer is logical.\nTherefore, argument D contains the same flaw as the original argument.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
