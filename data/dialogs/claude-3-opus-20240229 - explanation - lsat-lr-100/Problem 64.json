Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears\n  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon\n  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon\n  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly focused on the argument's assumption that shedding tears is sufficient to reduce emotional stress, overlooking the more fundamental flaw in the reasoning. The argument takes for granted that because stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of emotional stress. However, the mere presence of a substance when a condition occurs does not necessarily mean that the substance causes the condition.\n"

Let me think through this again step-by-step:\nThe argument's key points are:\n1) Human tears contain stress hormones \n2) Crying removes these hormones from the body\n3) Therefore, crying must reduce emotional stress\nThe argument assumes that because the stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of the emotional stress. However, this is a flawed assumption.\nJust because a substance is present when a condition occurs, that does not necessarily mean the substance causes the condition. There could be other explanations for why the hormones are in the tears.\nThe argument takes for granted the causal link between the hormones and the stress, without justifying this assumption. This matches the reasoning flaw described in answer choice E.\nThe other answer choices describe different reasoning flaws that are not the main issue with this particular argument.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
