This makes sense because the text mentions the mother drawing the game on the ground with a piece of chalk, which suggests that she is the one creating the game and setting up the rules. Therefore, it is more likely that she would be the one to push her kids to the center once the game is complete.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
