Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the instructions and answered based on my own assumptions rather than the given information.\n\nThe correct answer is (A): For example, using the number 1001001, 1=1, + 0=2, + 0=4, + 1=8, + 0=16, + 0=32, + 1=64. The number becomes : 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1.\n\nExplanation:\nIn binary, each digit can have one of two values, either 1 or 0. The number 1001001 can be broken down by assigning a value to each digit based on its position from the right. Starting from the extreme right, the values are: 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.\n\nTherefore, the decoded binary number is 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 64."
