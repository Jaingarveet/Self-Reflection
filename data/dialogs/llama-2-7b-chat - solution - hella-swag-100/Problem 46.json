The correct completion to the text is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. The text states that the man rakes the mulch out over the ground, which implies that he is adding more mulch to the lawn, not removing it. Option (A) rakes up dirt over the mulch is not a plausible completion, as the text does not mention anything about dirt. Option (B) uses a leaf blower to blow it around is also not a likely completion, as the text does not mention any blower or wind. Option (D) scoops out a puddle with the rake is not related to the text at all.\n\nAction: I will answer the question with the correct completion, which is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn.\n\nAnswer: (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn."
