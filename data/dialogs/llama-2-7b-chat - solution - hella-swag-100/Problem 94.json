This suggests that the young man is playing pool. The options provided are:\n\nA: The young man puts other balls in the pocket.\n\nThis option is unlikely, as the text does not mention the young man putting other balls in the pocket.\n\nB: The young man plays pool stroke to serve the ball as his opponent scores the ball.\n\nThis option is also unlikely, as the text does not mention the young man playing a pool stroke or serving the ball to his opponent.\n\nC: The man grab two wooden balls and hold them in the triangle.\n\nThis option is possible, as the text mentions the man grabbing two wooden balls and holding them in the triangle.\n\nD: The young man strikes the white ball but immediately stops it with the cue stick.\n\nThis option is also possible, as the text mentions the young man striking the white ball, but it does not provide enough information to determine if he stops it with the cue stick or not.\n\nConclusion: Based on the given text and options, the most likely completion is (C) The man grab two wooden balls and hold them in the triangle."
