If you're using an empty bottle, use a zip lock or a sheet of tin foil.\n\nExplanation:\nIt is important to ensure that the nozzle of the empty plastic bottle is clean and dry before using it for a gravity bong. This will help prevent any contaminants or residue from entering the bong and causing harm. Using a zip lock or a sheet of tin foil can also help keep the nozzle clean and dry.\n\n[REDACTED]"
