There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?\nChoices:\n  A: Vagus nerve\n  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve\n  C: SLN nerve\n  D: RLN nerve\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the role of the Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN) in swallowing. While it's true that the SLN is involved in voice production, it also plays a significant role in the swallowing mechanism. The SLN innervates the cricopharyngeus muscle, which is a part of the upper esophageal sphincter. Dysfunction of this muscle due to SLN injury can lead to aspiration.\n"
