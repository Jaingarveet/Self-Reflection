        "content": "Thought: \nAn unstable lie in pregnancy refers to a situation where the babyâ€™s position changes frequently. This can be due to several reasons. Oligohydramnios (A) refers to a condition where there is less amniotic fluid around the baby in the womb, which can indeed cause unstable lie. Placenta previa (B) is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix, but it doesn't typically cause an unstable lie. A pelvic tumor (C) could potentially cause an unstable lie by physically altering the space within the uterus. Uterine anomalies (D) can also cause an unstable lie, as they can alter the shape or size of the uterus. However, given the patient's history of two normal deliveries, it's less likely that she has a significant uterine anomaly. Therefore, the most likely cause in this case is oligohydramnios.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
