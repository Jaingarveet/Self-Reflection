While the formation of a food bolus is a physical change, it's not the primary physical change associated with digestion.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of question \n*   Incorrect assumption about relevance \n*   Prioritization error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Identify the type of change:** The question asks for a **physical change** during digestion. This means we should look for options that describe changes in form or movement, not chemical composition.\n2. **Analyze options:**\n    *   Option A describes a chemical change (adding acid).\n    *   Option B describes a chemical change (breaking down proteins).\n    *   Option C describes a chemical change (breaking down food substances).\n    *   **Option D describes a physical change (movement of food through the intestines).**\n3. **Choose the correct option:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **D**.\n## Instructions for Future\n1. **Identify the type of change** (physical or chemical) asked for in the question.\n2. **Carefully analyze each option** and determine whether it describes a physical or chemical change.\n3. **Consider the relevance of each option** to the specific process mentioned in the question (in this case, digestion).\n4. **Choose the option that best fits both criteria:** being a physical change and directly relevant to the process.\n## General Advice\n*   **Read the question carefully** and ensure you understand what it's asking.\n*   **Pay attention to keywords** that indicate the type of change or process.\n*   **Consider the context of the question** and the relevance of each option to that context.\n*   **Avoid making assumptions** about the relative importance of different options without careful analysis. \n*   **If unsure, eliminate options** that are clearly incorrect and choose from the remaining options.\n"
