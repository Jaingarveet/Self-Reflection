        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. \n2. The net energy yield from one molecule of glucose in glycolysis is:\n   - 2 ATP molecules: Substrate-level phosphorylation generates 4 ATP, but 2 ATP are consumed in earlier steps, so the net gain is 2 ATP.\n   - 2 NADH molecules: NAD+ is reduced to form NADH. This occurs twice per glucose molecule.\n3. Under anaerobic conditions (without oxygen), the NADH cannot be oxidized via the electron transport chain to regenerate NAD+. Instead, NADH is oxidized by reducing pyruvate to lactate (in animals) or to ethanol (in yeast and bacteria). This regenerates the NAD+ needed for glycolysis to continue.\nTherefore, the end products of anaerobic glycolysis are 2 ATP and 2 NADH per glucose molecule.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
