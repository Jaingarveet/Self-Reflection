When choosing a donor site for a split skin graft, we want an area that:\n   - Has healthy, undamaged skin\n   - Is relatively hidden for cosmetic reasons\n   - Will not be subject to a lot of movement or friction during healing\n3. In young children, the buttocks are a good choice because:\n   - The skin is usually healthy and undamaged \n   - It's a hidden area, important for cosmetic outcomes as the child grows\n   - When lying supine or prone, there is little movement or friction on the buttocks compared to the thighs or limbs\n4. The thighs and limbs move a lot in a young active child which could disrupt graft healing. The trunk is more visible cosmetically.\nTherefore, the best donor site for a split skin graft in a young child is the buttocks.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
