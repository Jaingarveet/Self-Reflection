In this procedure, islet cells (which produce insulin) are transplanted from a donor pancreas into a person with diabetes.\n3. The goal is for the transplanted islet cells to begin producing insulin in the recipient.\n4. For the transplanted cells to survive and function, they need a good blood supply.\n5. The liver has a rich blood supply that can support the transplanted islet cells.\n6. In islet cell transplantation, the cells are typically injected into the portal vein, which carries blood into the liver.\n7. Once in the liver, the islet cells can receive nutrients and oxygen from the blood, allowing them to survive and produce insulin.\nTherefore, the site of transplantation in islet cell transplant for diabetes mellitus is the liver, with the cells being injected into the portal vein.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
