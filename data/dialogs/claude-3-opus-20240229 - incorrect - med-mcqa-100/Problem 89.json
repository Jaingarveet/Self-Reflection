Anteroposterior (AP) X-ray: This view can show any lateral slippage of the vertebrae, which is a key feature of spondylolisthesis. It is a useful investigation.\nB. Lateral view X-ray: This view is essential for diagnosing spondylolisthesis as it clearly shows the forward slippage of one vertebra over another. It is a useful investigation.\nC. CT scan: A CT scan provides detailed cross-sectional images of the spine, which can help assess the extent of the slippage and any bony abnormalities. It is a useful investigation.\nD. MRI: An MRI is useful for evaluating the soft tissues, such as the intervertebral discs, spinal cord, and nerve roots. However, it may not be as effective as X-rays or CT scans in assessing the bony alignment and slippage in spondylolisthesis. While an MRI can provide additional information, it is not as essential as the other investigations for diagnosing spondylolisthesis.\nTherefore, among the given choices, MRI is the least useful investigation for spondylolisthesis.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
