        "content": "To determine the most likely cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida with two previous normal deliveries, let's consider each choice:\nA. Oligohydramnios: Low amniotic fluid volume can allow the fetus more room to move and change position, leading to an unstable lie.\nB. Placenta previa: A low-lying placenta can prevent the fetus from settling into a stable position, but this is less likely to cause an unstable lie compared to other factors.\nC. Pelvic tumor: A mass in the pelvis can physically obstruct the fetus from assuming a stable lie by occupying space and altering the shape of the uterine cavity.\nD. Uterine anomalies: Abnormalities in the shape of the uterus, such as a bicornuate or septate uterus, can prevent the fetus from settling into a stable position due to the irregular uterine cavity.\nConsidering the patient's history of two previous normal deliveries, uterine anomalies are less likely, as they would have likely caused issues in prior pregnancies.\nAmong the remaining choices, a pelvic tumor seems to be the most probable cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in this patient, as it can significantly alter the shape of the uterine cavity and prevent the fetus from assuming a stable position.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
