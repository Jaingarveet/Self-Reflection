They tend to be more rigid and fragile compared to younger RBCs.\n2. Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes falciparum malaria, is known to preferentially infect older RBCs. The infected RBCs become even more rigid and tend to adhere to blood vessel walls.\n3. In contrast, Plasmodium vivax (vivax malaria) and Plasmodium ovale (ovale malaria) preferentially infect younger RBCs called reticulocytes. \n4. Plasmodium malariae causes quartan malaria. While it can infect RBCs of all ages, it does not specifically target senescent cells.\n5. Therefore, among the given choices, senescent RBCs are mainly attacked in falciparum malaria caused by P. falciparum.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
