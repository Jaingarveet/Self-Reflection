Infundibulum: This is the funnel-shaped distal end of the uterine tube that opens near the ovary. It is relatively wide to capture the ovum released during ovulation.\nB. Ampulla: This is the widest and longest part of the uterine tube, making up about two-thirds of its length. Fertilization usually occurs in this segment.\nC. Isthmus: This is the narrow, medial portion of the uterine tube that connects the ampulla to the uterus. It has a thick muscular wall and a narrow lumen.\nD. Interstitial: This is the short, thick-walled segment of the uterine tube that passes through the uterine wall. It connects the isthmus to the uterine cavity.\nAmong these segments, the isthmus has the narrowest lumen, allowing only the passage of the fertilized ovum (zygote) towards the uterus for implantation.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
