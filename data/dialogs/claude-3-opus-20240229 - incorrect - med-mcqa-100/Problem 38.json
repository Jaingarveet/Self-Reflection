Rectocele is a herniation of the rectum into the vagina. This would not have a cobra head appearance radiologically.\n3. A ureterocele is a cystic dilation of the distal ureter within the bladder. On imaging, this can have a cobra head appearance as the dilated distal ureter protrudes into the bladder, resembling a cobra's flared neck.\n4. Posterior urethral valves are obstructing membranous folds within the posterior urethra in male infants. While they can cause dilation of the proximal urethra, they wouldn't have the characteristic cobra head sign.\n5. A bladder tumor would appear as a mass or filling defect in the bladder on imaging. It would not have the specific cobra head morphology.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that cobra head sign is seen with a ureterocele.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
