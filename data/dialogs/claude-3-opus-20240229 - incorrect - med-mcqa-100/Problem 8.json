Randomization is a process used to assign subjects to different treatment groups in a study.\n2. The goal of randomization is to ensure that each subject has an equal chance of being assigned to any given treatment group. This helps minimize bias.\n3. When subjects are randomly assigned, the researcher does not know ahead of time which treatment each subject will receive. The assignments are determined by chance.\n4. Equal chances and lack of foreknowledge are essential to true randomization.\nTherefore, in randomization, \"random\" implies equal chances of assignment to each group, and these chances are unknown to the researcher until the actual randomization occurs.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
