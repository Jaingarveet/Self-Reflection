Although scholars and diplomats in the sacrosanct inner circle of international affairs would have us think otherwise, anyone with an acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information can quickly learn to conduct a successful foreign policy. In fact, prior experience alone will be of little value to a foreign policymaker who lacks all three of these traits.\nQuestion: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Scholars and diplomats have more experience in foreign affairs than most presidents and prime ministers bring to office.\n  B: Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.\n  C: Prior experience in foreign affairs is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.\n  D: An acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information are each necessary conditions for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.\n  E: A president or prime minister with years of experience in foreign affairs will have a more successful foreign policy than one who does not have experience in foreign affairs.\n"
