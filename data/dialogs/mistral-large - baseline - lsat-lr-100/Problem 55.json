The conclusion is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.\n\nTo properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. Instead, it would allow us to determine whether the action was freely performed and, therefore, whether the person is responsible for it.\n\nChoice C aligns with this assumption, as it states that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard it as freely performed. This implies that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action would allow us to determine whether it was freely performed, rather than necessarily leading us to regard it as not freely performed.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
