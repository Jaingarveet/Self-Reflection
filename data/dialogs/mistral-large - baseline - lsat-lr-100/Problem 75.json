To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?\nChoices:\n  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.\n  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.\n  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.\n  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\n  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.\n"

This principle supports the Figorian Development Commission's argument that they should be allowed to develop wetlands since they claim that their development might not affect wildlife.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
