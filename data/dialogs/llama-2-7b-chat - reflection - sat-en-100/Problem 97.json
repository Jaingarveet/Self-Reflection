It has stood thus divided into Free and Slave States from its organization up to this day. During that period we have increased fromfour millions to thirty millions of people; we have extended our territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our geographical extent; we have increased in population,in wealth, and in power beyond any example on earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world; and all this has been done under aConstitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says isin violation of the law of God; and under a Union divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln thinks, because of such division, cannot stand. Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who framed the Government....I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each State will carry out the principles upon which our institutions were founded; to wit, the right of eachState to do as it pleases, without meddling with its neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this Union will not only live forever, but it will extend and expand until it covers the whole continent, and makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-boundRepublic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in the history of the world, that our national increase is great, and that the emigration from the old world is increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire newterritory from time to time, in order to give our people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle of State rights and State sovereignty, each State regulating its own affairs and minding its own business, we can go on and extend indefinitely, just 45 as fast and as far as we need the territory... .\\section{Passage 2}In complaining of what I said in my speech at Springfield, in which he says I accepted my nomination for the Senatorship ... he again quotes that portion in which I said that \"a house divided 50 against itself cannot stand.\" Let me say a word in regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different institutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face55 of the country, and the difference in the natural features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty among us? Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate60 the commerce that springs from the production of sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any differences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They don't make the65 house a \"house divided against itself.\" They are the props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.But has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?70 Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to observe that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery question, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has75 been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again\nQuestion: Based on Passage 2, Lincoln would be most likely to agree with which claim about the controversy over slavery?\nChoices:\n  A: It can be ended only if Northern states act unilaterally to abolish slavery throughout the United States.\n  B: It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.\n  C: It has been exacerbated by the ambiguity of laws regulating the holding of slaves.\n  D: It is fueled in part by differences in religion and social values from state to state.\n\n  Based on Passage 2, Lincoln would be most likely to agree with claim (B): It would abate if attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced were abandoned.\n\nIn Passage 2, Lincoln argues that the controversy over slavery has been a source of quarrels and difficulties in the United States, and that these quarrels have arisen from attempts to spread slavery into new territory. He suggests that if there were no further attempts to introduce slavery into regions where it is not already practiced, the controversy would abate. This aligns with claim (B), which suggests that reducing or eliminating the introduction of slavery into new regions would help to alleviate the controversy.\n\nLincoln does not seem to support claims (A) or (C), as he does not argue that the controversy over slavery can be ended through unilateral action by Northern states or that it has been exacerbated by the ambiguity of laws regulating the holding of slaves.\n\nFinally, claim (D) is not supported by Passage 2, as there is no mention of religion or social values playing a role in the controversy over slavery.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
