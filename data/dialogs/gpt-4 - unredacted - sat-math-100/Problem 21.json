I incorrectly calculated it as 12² - 4*3*6, when it should have been 12² - 4*3*2.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Discriminant error\n- Quadratic formula error\nSolution:\nThe given equation is a quadratic equation. The solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.\nHere, a=3, b=12, and c=6.\nSo, the solutions are $x=\\frac{-12\\pm\\sqrt{12^{2}-4*3*6}}{2*3}$.\nThis simplifies to $x=-2\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{36}}{6}$, which further simplifies to $x=-2\\pm\\sqrt{2}$.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the coefficients a, b, and c in the quadratic equation.\n2. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.\n3. Calculate the discriminant (b²-4ac) carefully.\n4. Simplify the expression under the square root.\n5. Simplify the entire expression to find the solutions.\nAdvice:\n- Always double-check your calculations, especially when calculating the discriminant in the quadratic formula.\n- Be careful with signs when substituting values into the quadratic formula.\n- Simplify the expression under the square root before proceeding with the rest of the calculation.\n- Practice more problems involving the quadratic formula to become more comfortable with the process.\n"
