The clear chemical evidence that Hahn found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium is the most direct and conclusive evidence that supports the discovery of nuclear fission. Hahn's remark that it went against all previous experiences of nuclear physics highlights the significance of this evidence in challenging the prevailing understanding and leading to a new theoretical connection. Therefore, option C is the best answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* A: The results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939 are not specific enough to be considered the relevant evidence. While these experiments provided valuable data, they did not lead directly to the recognition of nuclear fission.\n* B: The results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938 are not the most relevant to the discovery of nuclear fission. Meitner's research was significant in that it led to her recognition of the significance of the data, but the key evidence was the chemical identification of barium, which was discovered by Hahn.\n* D: The fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus is an important clue, but it was not the direct evidence that led to the discovery of nuclear fission. This fact was noted by Hahn, but he did not recognize its significance until Meitner pointed it out.\n* E: The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long is not directly related to the discovery of nuclear fission. While it is true that the radioactive products were not properly identified for some time, this was not the key evidence that led to the breakthrough.\n\nInstructions:\n\n* Read the passage carefully and pay attention to the context in which the term \"relevant evidence\" is used.\n* Consider each option and evaluate whether it accurately reflects the author's intention when using the term \"relevant evidence.\"\n* Use the process of elimination to arrive at the best answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Pay attention to the details in the passage, especially those that relate to the discovery of nuclear fission.\n* Consider the context in which the term \"relevant evidence\" is used and what the author means by it.\n* Evaluate each option carefully and use the process of elimination to arrive at the best answer.\n\nNote: The answer and explanation are based on the given passage and do not rely on any external knowledge or information."
