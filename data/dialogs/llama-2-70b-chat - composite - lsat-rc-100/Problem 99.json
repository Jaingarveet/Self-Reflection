        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from \"bicultural composite authorship.\" Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase \"bicultural composite authorship\" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture\n  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product\n  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined\n  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture\n  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n\nThe phrase \"bicultural composite authorship\" refers to the process of creating written documents that reflect the collaboration between individuals from different cultures. In the context of the passage, this refers to the written accounts of Native American life histories that were created through the collaboration of non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers. The passage suggests that these accounts were based on oral traditions and artifacts of Native American cultures, but were written down by non-Native American collaborators. Therefore, option [REDACTED] accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase, as it implies that the written works are based on oral communication by members of one culture (Native Americans) but are written down by members of another culture (non-Native Americans).\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the phrase \"bicultural composite authorship\"\n* Incorrect application of the options\n\nSolution:\n\n1.
