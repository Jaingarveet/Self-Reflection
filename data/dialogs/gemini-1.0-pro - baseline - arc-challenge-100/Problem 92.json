Over the last 150 years, the use of fossil fuels has increased, resulting in more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some scientists think that these atmospheric gases will result in global warming. Scientists have recorded data on global temperature changes and have predicted possible changes in sea level that may affect Maryland residents. Which result of global warming will most negatively affect coastal residents in Maryland?\nChoices:\n  A: loss of shore land\n  B: erosion of mountains\n  C: decrease in average temperature\n  D: increase in the size of the polar ice caps\n"
