But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. These results, which have not been equaled by quantum theory's competitors, warrant acceptance of quantum theory.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than do its competitors.\n  B: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.\n  C: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.\n  D: A theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it.\n  E: A theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: The best answer is B: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.\n\nThe passage suggests that quantum theory has been rigorously tested and its predictions have been accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error, despite scientists' reservations about its counterintuitive consequences. This justifies accepting the theory according to choice B.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that quantum theory is accepted because it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than its competitors.\n\nChoice C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the consequences of quantum theory should not be considered counterintuitive just because its predictions have been found to be accurate.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because while it is true that a theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it, the passage goes further by stating that quantum theory has been subjected to such attempts and has withstood them.\n\nChoice E is incorrect because while it is true that a theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment, the passage does not mention any experiments that disproved quantum theory's predictions. Instead, it states that quantum theory's predictions were accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error."
