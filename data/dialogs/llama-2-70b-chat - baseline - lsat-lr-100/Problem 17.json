By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances.\n  B: A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities.\n  C: Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people.\n  D: While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself.\n  E: Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups. People will admire their courage and they will experience the fulfillment of having attempted something that is difficult for them.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nThe principle states that challenge can provide useful insights into one's weaknesses. Option A conforms to this principle as it suggests that a concert pianist should not have a entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances. This implies that the pianist is using the challenge of the difficult performance to gain insights into their own weaknesses and improve their performance.\n\nOption B, C, D and E do not conform to the principle. Option B talks about the satisfaction of making a sale and how it reflects well on a salesperson's personality, but it does not relate to gaining insights into one's weaknesses. Option C talks about the value of compassion for enriching the lives of others, but it does not relate to personal self-knowledge. Option D talks about the value of competition, but it does not mention anything about gaining insights into one's weaknesses. Option E suggests that people should accept invitations to speak before large groups, but it does not relate to gaining insights into one's weaknesses through challenge."
