        "content": "  Answer: B\n\nThe fact that there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument. This information supports the idea that if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in that neighborhood. It also suggests that the high number of cocker spaniels in Flynn Heights may contribute to the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.\n\nThe other options do not provide as much relevant information for evaluating the argument:\n\nA: Whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners is not directly relevant to the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.\n\nC: Whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city may be relevant, but it does not specifically address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found in the area belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.\n\nD: Whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood may be relevant, but it does not directly address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood.\n\nE: Whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are may be relevant, but it does not directly address the likelihood that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to a resident of that neighborhood."
