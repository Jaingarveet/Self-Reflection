The correct assumption is that the university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively (choice C).\n\nThe other choices do not support the conclusion:\n\n* Choice A: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would negatively impact the quality of education, which contradicts the president's argument.\n* Choice B: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but the argument only establishes a link between marketing and enrollment, not between enrollment and spending reductions.\n* Choice D: This statement suggests that reducing spending would negatively impact the quality of education, but the argument does not address the relationship between spending and quality.\n* Choice E: This statement suggests that marketing would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but, like choice B, it does not follow from the argument's premises."
