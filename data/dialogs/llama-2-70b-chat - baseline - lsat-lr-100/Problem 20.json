This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.\n  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.\n  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.\n  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\n  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: D\n\nThe judge's reasoning is most supported by the principle that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance. The defendant's confusion about whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building does not excuse his noncompliance with national building codes. This is because ignorance of the law is not a valid defense, and the defendant is still responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, even if he is unsure about which laws apply.\n\nChoice D most closely aligns with this principle, as it states that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance. The other choices do not directly address the issue of ignorance or excuses for noncompliance, and thus do not support the judge's reasoning."
