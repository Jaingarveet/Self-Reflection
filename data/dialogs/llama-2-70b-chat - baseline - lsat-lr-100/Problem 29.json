It is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. Therefore, consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are thereby behaving rationally.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information.\n  B: Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.\n  C: The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  D: Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  E: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n"

        "content": "  The answer is E: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\nThe argument concludes that consumers who do not bother to acquire detailed information about a product are behaving rationally. This conclusion follows logically if we assume that consumers who do not expect the benefits of acquiring such information to outweigh the costs and difficulties do not bother to acquire it. Therefore, choice E is the best answer.\n\nChoice A is not necessarily true. Even if rational consumers who do not expect the benefits to outweigh the costs do not bother to acquire detailed information, it does not mean that all consumers who do not acquire such information are rational.\n\nChoice B is also not necessarily true. It is possible that, in some cases, it may be rational to acquire detailed information even if the benefits do not outweigh the costs. For instance, if the product is very expensive or has significant safety concerns, it may be worth the effort and cost to gather more information.\n\nChoice C is not relevant to the argument. Even if the benefits of acquiring detailed information usually do not outweigh the costs, it does not necessarily follow that consumers who do not acquire such information are behaving rationally.\n\nChoice D is also not relevant. The argument does not assume that rational consumers usually expect the benefits to not outweigh the costs. Instead, it assumes that consumers who do not expect the benefits to outweigh the costs do not bother to acquire detailed information."
