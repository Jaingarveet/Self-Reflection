Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.\n  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.\n  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.\n  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.\n  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument states that while a diet based on fish protein is healthier, adopting it universally would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Similarly, choice C states that while it's better for a consumer to limit purchases to necessities and save or invest the rest, adopting this pattern universally would cause a recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people. Both arguments acknowledge a benefit in a particular behavior or policy but recognize that universal adoption would have negative consequences, making it unfeasible. Therefore, choice C most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument."
