Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.\n  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.\n  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.\n  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.\n  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe question asks for the choice that is most similar to the reasoning above, which is: \"Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.\"\n\nThe correct answer is B, \"When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.\"\n\nThis answer choice uses the same type of reasoning as the original scenario. In both cases, there are two equally desirable options, and the person chooses one of them based on a specific characteristic (in this case, the price or the fact that it's the first ride). The other options do not use this type of reasoning, and some of them are even opposite in their logic.\n\nFor example, choice A states that Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties. This is the opposite of the reasoning in the original scenario, where Ed chooses the more expensive option.\n\nChoice C is also different, as it states that Asteroid Y's orbit is more eccentric than asteroid X's because it's affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull. This has nothing to do with choosing between two equally desirable options.\n\nChoice D states that Miyoko will probably not enter this program because she has no desire to take a class in physics or art. This is not similar to the original scenario, as Miyoko is not choosing between two equally desirable options.\n\nChoice E states that the rabbit being pursued by a fox will try to double back on the fox because there's no nearby cover. This is also different from the original scenario, as the rabbit is not choosing between two equally desirable options."
