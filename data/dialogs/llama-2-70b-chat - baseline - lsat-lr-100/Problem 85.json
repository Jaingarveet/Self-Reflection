This feature will encourage people who would otherwise copy the game to purchase it instead, thereby increasing sales.\n\nOption A does not directly support the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the feature and needs to recoup the cost does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.\n\nOption B does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame's market share has shrunk does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales.\n\nOption D does not provide support for the president's prediction. Even if Game Review Monthly gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games, it does not mean that people who frequently copy games will purchase Ditalgame games instead of copying them.\n\nOption E does not provide support for the president's prediction. The fact that Ditalgame games are copied more frequently than other games does not necessarily mean that the new copy protection feature will increase sales."
