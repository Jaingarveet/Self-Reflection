So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.\nQuestion: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?\nChoices:\n  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.\n  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.\n  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.\n  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.\n  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.\n"

But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.\n\nExplanation:\nBoth the argument and choice D share a similar pattern of reasoning, which is:\n\n1. If A occurs, B will happen.\n2. B occurs if C is true.\n3. Therefore, if C is true, A will occur.\n\nIn the argument, A is \"the bird feeder will not attract many birds,\" B is \"the bird feeder lacks a protective cover,\" and C is \"squirrels eat from the bird feeder.\" The argument concludes that if C is true (squirrels eat from the bird feeder), then A will occur (the bird feeder will not attract many birds).\n\nSimilarly, in choice D, A is \"a tire will wear out prematurely,\" B is \"the tire's pressure is too low,\" and C is \"the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.\" Choice D concludes that if C is true (the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly), then A will occur (the tire will wear out prematurely).\n\nBoth the argument and choice D contain a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because B follows A, A must follow B. In other words, just because a low tire pressure or a lack of protective cover on a bird feeder can lead to a particular outcome (premature tire wear or squirrels eating from the feeder), it does not mean that the outcome is guaranteed to occur every time those conditions are present. There could be other factors at play that influence the outcome.\n\nTherefore, choice D is the best answer."
