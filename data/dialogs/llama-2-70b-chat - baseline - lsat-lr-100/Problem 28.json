Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: E\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument claims that the average citizen of the town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. However, if a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes, then the increase in calls involving violent crimes may not necessarily indicate an increase in the overall risk of violent crime for the average citizen. This weakens the argument by suggesting that the increase in reported violent crimes may be due to a small number of repeat offenders rather than a widespread increase in violent crime. Therefore, option E most seriously weakens the argument."
