        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.\n  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.\n  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.\n  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.\n  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.\n"

        "content": "  Thought: \nThe publisher's prediction that sales of the game will soon exceed expectations is most supported by choice B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.\n\nSince the game's puzzles and plot are engaging, even casual players become preoccupied with completing it, which suggests that players are spending a significant amount of time playing the game. The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game means that there is a high likelihood that many players who rent the game will not be able to complete it within the two-day rental period. As a result, these players are likely to purchase the game to continue playing it, which will increase sales.\n\nThe other choices do not directly support the publisher's prediction:\n\n* Choice A: The fact that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers does not necessarily increase the likelihood that renters will go on to purchase the game.\n* Choice C: The popularity of the publisher's games does not necessarily mean that players who rent the game will go on to purchase it.\n* Choice D: The fact that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward does not necessarily mean that they will not purchase it.\n* Choice E: The fact that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend does not necessarily increase the likelihood that renters will go on to purchase the game.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
