        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.\n  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.\n  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.\n  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: \nThe assumption required by the curator's argument is:\n\nD: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n\nThe curator's argument relies on the idea that the legs of the hippopotamus were broken off intentionally, as part of a religious ritual. If the legs were broken off naturally, through some accident or natural process after the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb, then the curator's conclusion that it was a religious object would not be supported. Therefore, assumption D is necessary for the curator's argument.\n\nHere's how the other choices relate to the question:\n\nA: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child. This statement is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not affect the curator's argument. The curator's argument does not rely on the age of the person buried in the tomb.\n\nB: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt. This statement is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not affect the curator's argument. The curator's argument does not rely on the specific use of earthenware figures in ancient Egypt.\n\nC: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it. This statement is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not affect the curator's argument. The curator's argument does not rely on the history of the tomb after the burial.\n\nE: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb. This statement is not necessarily true, and even if it were, it would not affect the curator's argument. The curator's argument relies on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed upside down in the tomb as part of a religious ritual, but it does not rely on the specific orientation of the hippopotamus at the time of burial."
