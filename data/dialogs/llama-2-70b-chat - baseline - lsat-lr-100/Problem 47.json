He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.\n  B: Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled.\n  C: Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes.\n  D: Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes.\n  E: Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: D\n\nThe fact that Carl previously solved only 1 out of 30 crimes in another police department seriously weakens the argument that he is an incompetent detective. It suggests that Carl has a consistent track record of low success in solving crimes, which undermines the idea that his low success rate in the last 3 years is due to his incompetence. It could be that Carl is simply not skilled at solving crimes, regardless of his abilities as a detective. Therefore, choice D weakens the argument."
