I incorrectly assumed that the line must have a slope of 1, but this is not the case since the line passes through the origin. By substituting the given points into the point-slope formula, I can find the correct slope and then use this to find the value of $k$.\n\nThought: \nThe line passes through the origin, so its coordinates are (0, 0). Using the formula for slope, $(y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1)$, we can find the slope of the line:\n\n$(32 - k)/(k - 2) = 0$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$32 - k = 0$\n$k = 32$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $k = 32$, which is choice D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
