I should have added the coefficients in the thousands place instead. Correct calculation:\n\n$x = \\frac{1}{6} (8,000 - 3,000) = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 1,000 = \\mathbf{1,\\ 666.67}$\n$y = \\frac{1}{6} (2,000 - 4,000) = -\\frac{2}{3} \\times 1,000 = \\mathbf{-666.67}$\n\nNow, $x - y = 1,666.67 - (-666.67) = \\mathbf{2,333.34}.$\n\nThought: To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method. First, we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of one of the variables equal:\n\n$3(2x - 3y = -14) \\rightarrow 6x - 9y = -42$\n$2(3x - 2y = -6) \\rightarrow 6x - 4y = -12$.\n\nAdding the two equations, we get $12x - 13y = -54$. Now, dividing both sides by the coefficient of $x$, we find $x = \\frac{54}{12} = 4.5$.\n\nWe can plug this value back into either equation and solve for $y$. Let's use the first equation:\n\n$2x - 3y = -14$ becomes $2(4.5) - 3y = -14$, which simplifies to $9 - 3y = -14$, and then $-3y = -14 - 9 = -23$, so $y = \\frac{23}{3} \\approx 7.67$.\n\nNow that we have the values for $x$ and $y$, we can find the value of $x - y$:\n\n$x - y = 4.5 - 7.67 = -3.17$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $-\\mathbf{3.17}$, which is not one of the provided choices. Since I must select one of the available choices, I will choose the closest value, which is $-8$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
