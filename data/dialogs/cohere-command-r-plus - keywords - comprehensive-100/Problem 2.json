There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide by 12:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x/2 - 6}{12}$$\nThis can be simplified to $\\frac{13x}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}$ feet, which equals $\\frac{13x}{2} - 6$ feet since there are 6 inches in half a foot.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: $13x/2 - 6$.\n\nReflection:\nI made a simplification error in my previous attempt. I correctly found the total width of the fence in inches, but then I incorrectly simplified the expression when converting it to feet. I divided both the numerator and denominator by 12, but I should have only divided the numerator by 6 since there are 6 inches in half a foot. This correction yields the correct answer, choice B."
