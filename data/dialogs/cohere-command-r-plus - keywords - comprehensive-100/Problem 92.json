I should have considered the characteristics of each tumor type and their propensity for torsion, rather than focusing solely on prevalence.\n\nThought: \nDermoid cysts are solid tumors that often contain hair, sebaceous material, and other tissue components. This solid content makes them more susceptible to torsion, especially during pregnancy when the growing uterus and increasing vascular congestion further elevate the risk.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
