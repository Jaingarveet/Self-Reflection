Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

While Vertucci's system is widely used for root canal anatomy, the specific classification of the isthmus was developed by Kim.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misidentification\n* Confusion of classifications\n* Incomplete knowledge of dental anatomy\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the specific aspect of root canal anatomy being classified.** In this case, it is the isthmus.\n2. **Recall the different classification systems for root canal anatomy.** This includes Vertucci, Schilder, and Kim.\n3. **Match the specific aspect (isthmus) with the corresponding classification system (Kim).**\n4. **Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct classification (Kim).**\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. When encountering a question about specific anatomical classifications, identify the exact structure or feature being classified.\n2. Recall the different classification systems relevant to the topic.\n3. Match the specific structure/feature with the appropriate classification system.\n4. Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct classification system.\n**General Advice:**\n* Maintain a strong understanding of the various classification systems used in dentistry.\n* Practice active recall of specific classifications and their corresponding structures/features.\n* When unsure, refer to reliable sources for accurate information.\n* Avoid making assumptions or relying solely on partial knowledge. \n"
