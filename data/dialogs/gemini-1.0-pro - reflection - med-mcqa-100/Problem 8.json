Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the concept of \"randomness\" without considering the additional information provided by the phrase \"randomization implies.\" While randomness indeed implies unknown chances, the act of randomization specifically aims to create **equal** chances for each possible outcome.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation of \"randomization implies\"\n* Focus on randomness alone\n* Neglecting the concept of equal chances\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the key terms:** \"randomization\" and \"chances.\"\n2. **Understand the meaning of \"randomization\":** It is a process that ensures each outcome has an equal probability of occurring.\n3. **Combine the concepts:** Randomization implies that the chances are both **equal** and **unknown**.\n4. Choose the answer that reflects this understanding.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. Carefully read and analyze the entire question, including all modifiers and implications.\n2. Break down complex concepts into simpler components.\n3. Define key terms and ensure a clear understanding of their meaning.\n4. Consider all aspects of the question before formulating an answer.\n5. Double-check your understanding and reasoning before selecting a final answer.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* Pay close attention to the specific wording and context of the question.\n* Actively seek clarification if any part of the question is unclear.\n* Utilize critical thinking skills to analyze the information provided.\n* Apply knowledge and understanding of relevant concepts to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n* Maintain a cautious approach and avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions. \n"
