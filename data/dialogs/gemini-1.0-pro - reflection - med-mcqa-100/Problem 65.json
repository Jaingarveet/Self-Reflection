Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I did not consider all of the treatment options for post-radiation skin lesions. \nWhile petroleum jellies can be helpful in some cases, observation alone is often the best course of treatment for desquamation. \nThis is because desquamation is usually a self-limiting condition that resolves on its own. \nAntibiotic coverage is only necessary if there are signs of infection, and surgery is rarely necessary.\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete consideration of treatment options\n- Overlooking the self-limiting nature of desquamation\n- Misunderstanding the role of observation in treatment\nSolution:\n1. Identify the type of skin lesion: Desquamation\n2. Determine the cause of the skin lesion: Post-radiation therapy\n3. Consider the natural history of the skin lesion: Self-limiting, typically resolves within a few weeks\n4. Evaluate the potential benefits and risks of each treatment option:\n    - Petroleum jellies: Can help keep the skin moist and prevent further irritation, but may not be necessary if the skin is not excessively dry or irritated.\n    - Observation alone: Allows the skin to heal naturally without intervention, reducing the risk of complications from treatment.\n    - Antibiotic coverage: Only necessary if there are signs of infection, which is uncommon with desquamation.\n    - Surgery: Rarely necessary for desquamation.\n5. Choose the treatment option with the most favorable risk-benefit profile: Observation alone.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and identify the specific skin lesion and its cause.\n2. Consider the natural history of the skin lesion and its expected course.\n3. Evaluate the potential benefits and risks of each available treatment option.\n4. Choose the treatment option that aligns with the principles of evidence-based medicine and best practice guidelines.\n5. If unsure, consult with a medical professional specializing in radiation oncology or dermatology for guidance.\nGeneral Advice:\n- Stay up-to-date with the latest evidence-based treatment guidelines and best practices in your field.\n- Consider the individual patient's needs and preferences when making treatment decisions.\n- Be mindful of potential complications and side effects associated with different treatment options.\n- When in doubt, seek consultation from experienced colleagues or specialists.\n- Continuously reflect on your clinical decision-making process to identify areas for improvement and enhance patient care."
