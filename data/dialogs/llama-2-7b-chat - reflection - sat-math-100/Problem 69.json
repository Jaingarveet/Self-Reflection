The correct equation to determine how many fewer miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) $\\frac{4}{25} m = 5$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Arithmetic error\n* Division error\n\nSolution:\n\nTo reduce Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$, he needs to drive fewer miles. Let's use the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$\n\nWhere $m$ is the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$$m = \\frac{95}{25}$$\n\nSo, Alan should drive $5$ fewer miles each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the problem and the goal.\n2. Write the equation that represents the problem.\n3. Solve the equation to find the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.\n4.
