Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \\%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?\nChoices:\n  A: $P(t)=310^{t}$\n  B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$\n  C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$\n  D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$\n\n  Great, let's solve this problem!\n\nWe are given that Keith modeled the growth of a tree population by estimating the number of pollen grains per square centimeter that were deposited each year within layers of a lake's sediment. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter is given by $P(t)$, where $t$ is the number of years after the first year the grains were deposited.\n\nWe are also given that the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increased by $1\\%$ each year after the first year.\n\nSo, we can write the function $P(t)$ as:\n\n$$P(t) = 310 + 310 \\times 1.01^t$$\n\nNow, we have to choose the correct function from the options given.\n\nOption A: $P(t)=310^{t}$\n\nThis function does not match the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter does not increase exponentially with time.\n\nOption B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$\n\nThis function matches the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\\%$ each year after the first year.\n\nOption C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$\n\nThis function does not match the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter does not decrease exponentially with time.\n\nOption D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$\n\nThis function matches the given information. The number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by $1\\%$ each year after the first year.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
