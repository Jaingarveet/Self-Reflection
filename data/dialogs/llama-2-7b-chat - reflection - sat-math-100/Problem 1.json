Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $v=h+k-16 t$\n  B: $v=\\frac{h-k+16}{t}$\n  C: $v=\\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$\n  D: $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$\n\n  Thought: To find the velocity $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$, we need to use the given equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$.\n\nAction: Let's first isolate $v$ by subtracting $k$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$$h=-16 t^{2}+v t-k$$\n\nNow, let's divide both sides of the equation by $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{h}{t}=-\\frac{16}{t^{2}}+v-\\frac{k}{t}$$\n\nNow, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{h}{t}=-\\frac{16}{t^{2}}+v-k$$\n\nNow, let's solve for $v$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $h$:\n\n$$\\frac{v}{h}=-\\frac{16}{t^{2}}+k$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B): $v=\\frac{h-k+16}{t}$.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
