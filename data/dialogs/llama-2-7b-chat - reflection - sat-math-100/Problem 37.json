However, I made an error in my calculation.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Formula application error\n* Radius miscalculation\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the first cylinder is 22 cubic centimeters.\nThe radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.\nThe height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.\nUsing the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:\nV = π(1/2)^2 \\* 2h = π \\* 1/4 \\* 2 \\* 22 = 44 cubic centimeters\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder.\n2. Apply the formula to the problem, using the given information.\n3. Calculate the volume of the second cylinder using the formula and the given information.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always use the correct formula for the problem, and apply it correctly.\n* Always calculate each subproblem step-by-step, and double-check your calculations.\n* Always use the correct units for the problem, and make sure they are consistent throughout the calculation.\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before starting the calculation."
