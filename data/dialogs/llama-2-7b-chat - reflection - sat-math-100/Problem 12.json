        "content": " Explanation:\nYou have correctly analyzed the information given in the question and arrived at the correct answer. Great job!\n\nHere's a breakdown of your thought process:\n\n1. You recognized that the population of City X increased by 20% from 2010 to 2015, which means the population of City X in 2015 was 144,000 (120,000 x 1.20).\n2. You then used this information to calculate the population of City Y in 2010, by recognizing that the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. You calculated the population of City Y in 2010 as 108,000 (120,000 x 0.90).\n3. You then evaluated the options given and chose the correct answer, which is option B: 108,000.\n\nWell done!\n\nIn general, to solve problems like this, it's important to:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information given.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part step-by-step.\n3. Use the information given in the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n4. Double-check your calculations and ensure that your answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nRemember, practice makes perfect, so keep practicing and you'll become more confident and proficient in solving math problems!"
