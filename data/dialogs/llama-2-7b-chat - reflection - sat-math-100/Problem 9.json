Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{68}{100}$\n  B: $\\frac{79}{100}$\n  C: $\\frac{79}{164}$\n  D: $\\frac{164}{200}$\n\n  Thought: To find the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y, we need to use the total number of dreams recalled by each group.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that Group X recalled 36 dreams, and Group Y recalled 125 dreams. So, the total number of dreams recalled is 161 (36 + 125).\n\nNow, let's find the number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone:\n\nGroup Y recalled 68 dreams.\n\nSo, the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:\n\n$$\\frac{68}{161}$$\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
