Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 0.45.\n\nTo find the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that they did not answer \"Never,\" we can use the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)\n\nwhere:\n\n* P(A) is the probability of answering \"Always\"\n* P(B) is the probability of not answering \"Never\"\n* P(A ∩ B) is the probability of answering \"Always\" and not answering \"Never\"\n\nFrom the table, we can see that:\n\n* P(A) = 0.30 (from the last column)\n* P(B) = 0.69 (from the first column)\n* P(A ∩ B) = 0.30 x 0.69 = 0.207\n\nSo, the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that they did not answer \"Never,\" is:\n\nP(Always|Never) = P(A|B) = 0.207\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 0.45.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* When dealing with conditional probability problems, make sure to use the correct formula and to isolate the probability of the event of interest.\n* Always check your calculations to ensure that they are correct.\n* In this problem, it was important to use the information that the probability of not answering \"Never\" was 0.69 to find the probability of answering \"Always\" given that the user did not answer \"Never\"."
