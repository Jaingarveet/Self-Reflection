Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\right)$.\nQuestion: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?\nChoices:\n  A: $-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  B: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  C: $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  D: $-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n\n  Thought: The formula given in the question shows that the speed of a sound wave is directly proportional to the inverse of the air temperature. As the air temperature increases, the speed of the sound wave decreases, and vice versa.\n\nAction: To find the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to set the expression $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$ equal to 1,000:\n\n$1,052 + 1.08t = 1,000$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t = -47.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

To find the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to set this expression equal to 1,000 and solve for $t$.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in your solution. You correctly solved for $t$ to be $-47.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$, but you then incorrectly answered that the correct answer is (C).\n\nThe correct answer is (B): $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen we set $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$ equal to 1,000, we get:\n\n$1,052 + 1.08t = 1,000$\n\nSolving for $t$, we get:\n\n$t = -48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n\nTherefore, the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second is $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nGreat job on recognizing the direct proportional relationship between the speed of a sound wave and the inverse of the air temperature!"
