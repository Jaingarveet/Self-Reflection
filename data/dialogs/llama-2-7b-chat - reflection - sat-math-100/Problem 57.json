Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Therefore, the total number of people in these two groups is 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nThe total number of people in the contest is 25, so the probability of the winner being either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older is:\n\nProbability = Number of people in the desired group / Total number of people in the contest\n= 11 / 25\n= $\\frac{11}{25}$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $\\frac{11}{25}$.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* When solving probability problems, always identify the relevant groups and count the number of people in each group.\n* Use the formula for probability: Probability = Number of people in the desired group / Total number of people in the contest.\n* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that the probability of an event occurring is always between 0 and 1, inclusive."
