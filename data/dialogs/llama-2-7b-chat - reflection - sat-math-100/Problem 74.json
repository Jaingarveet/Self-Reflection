Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  Explanation:\n\nYou are correct that the expression $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}}$ can be simplified using the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction. However, the simplified expression you arrived at, $\\frac{2x+5}{x^{2}+5x+6}$, is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (B): $\\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.\n\nHere's how you can arrive at the correct answer:\n\nUsing the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction, we can write:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{x+2}{x+3} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+2}$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the expression by combining the like terms:\n\n$$\\frac{x+2}{x+3} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+2} = \\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): $\\frac{x^{2}+5x+6}{2x+5}$.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* When simplifying expressions, always use the appropriate formulas and techniques to arrive at the simplified form.\n* When dealing with fractions, use the formula for the reciprocal of a fraction to simplify the expression.\n* Always check your work by verifying that the simplified expression is equivalent to the original expression."
