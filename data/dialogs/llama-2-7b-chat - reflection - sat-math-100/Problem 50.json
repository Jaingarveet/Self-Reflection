Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

We are asked to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female.\n3. Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of female right-handed students:\n\nFemale right-handed students = 122 - 18 = 104\n4. Now, we can find the probability of a right-handed student being female:\n\nProbability of a right-handed student being female = Number of female right-handed students / Total number of right-handed students\n= 104 / 122\n= 0.86\n5. So, the closest answer is (B): 0.357.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nGreat, let's review the steps and key points:\n\n* Identified the information given in the problem: number of left-handed and right-handed students by gender.\n* Used the information to find the number of female right-handed students.\n* Calculated the probability of a right-handed student being female.\n* Compared the calculated probability to the choices given in the question.\n* Chose the closest answer: (B): 0.357.\n\nBy following these steps and using the information given in the problem, we can solve the problem accurately. Remember to always read the question carefully, identify the relevant information, and use logical reasoning to find the solution."
