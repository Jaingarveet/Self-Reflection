Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The value 1.88 in the formula represents the ratio of the height of the male to the length of his femur.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length.\n\nExplanation:\nThe formula $H=1.88L+32.01$ can be interpreted as the height of an adult male increases by $1.88$ inches for every one-inch increase in the length of his femur. Therefore, the value 1.88 represents the proportional relationship between the height and the femur length.\n\nIn this context, the value 1.88 is not the approximate femur length, as option (A) suggests, nor is it the approximate increase in a man's femur length for each increase of 32.01 inches in his height, as option (B) suggests. Nor is it the approximate increase in a man's femur length for each one-inch increase in his height, as option (C) suggests.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length."
