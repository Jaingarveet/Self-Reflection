Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?\nChoices:\n  A: 250\n  B: 350\n  C: 450\n  D: 1,350\n\n  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nWe are given the following information:\n\n* The quantity of a product supplied (S(P)) = $\\frac{1}{2} P + 40$\n* The quantity of the product demanded (D(P)) = $220 - P$\n* A sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields\n\nNow, we need to find out how many acres a certain amount of graphene can cover. Let's use the information given in the question:\n\n* The area of a football field is approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres\n\nSo, we can calculate the area of one football field as follows:\n\nArea of one football field = $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres\n\nNow, let's find out how many acres 48 ounces of graphene can cover:\n\n48 ounces of graphene = ? acres\n\nWe are given that a sheet of graphene weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. So, we can calculate the area of one ounce of graphene as follows:\n\nArea of one ounce of graphene = 7 football fields\n\nNow, we can convert the area of one ounce of graphene to acres:\n\nArea of one ounce of graphene in acres = $7 \\times \\frac{1}{3}$ acres/football field = 2.33 acres/ounce\n\nNow, we have the information we need to find out how many acres 48 ounces of graphene can cover:\n\n48 ounces of graphene = ? acres\n\n48 ounces = 48 $\\times$ 2.33 acres/ounce = 1,104 acres\n\nSo, 48 ounces of graphene can cover approximately 1,104 acres.\n\nNow, let's choose the correct answer from the options given in the question:\n\nB) 350 acres is the closest answer to the actual value of 1,104 acres.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) 350 acres.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
