        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\n\nThought:\nThe passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the passage only states that monstrous beast stories sometimes describe violations of the laws of nature, not all of them. \nOption C is incorrect because the passage only mentions that some stories about monstrous beasts use the monster as a symbol for a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. \nOption D is incorrect because the passage only states that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, not that they are antiscientific. \nOption E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about symbolism. \nOption B is correct because the passage states that horror stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to produce dread in the reader.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
