Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The late famous logician Jin Yuelin of China heard the words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" when he was a child, and found that there are logical problems because they can lead to the absurd conclusion of \"friends are like dung\".\nQuestion: Since the conclusion of \"friends like dung\" is not true, it can be logically derived?\nChoices:\n  A: The expression \"money is like dung\" is false.\n  B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.\n  C: The statement that \"friends are valuable\" is true.\n  D: The words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false.\n\nThought:\nThe question is asking which statement can be logically derived from the fact that the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true.\nIf \"friends are like dung\" is not true, then it must be false that \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\".\nTherefore, the statement \"friends are valuable\" cannot be true.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nThe correct answer is B because it provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true. If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. This statement contradicts the premise that \"money is like dung\" and therefore invalidates the argument that leads to the absurd conclusion \"friends are like dung\". The statement \"friends are valuable\" is not necessarily false, as it is possible for friends to be valuable even if they are not worth a thousand dollars. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the question\n - Incorrectly assuming the negation of a statement\n - Incorrectly assuming the truth value of a statement\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the statement that can be logically derived from the fact that the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true. The conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true because it leads to an absurdity. Therefore, we need to find a statement that can explain why this conclusion is not true. Option B provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not true, and is therefore the correct answer.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the conclusion that is not true.\n3. Identify the statement that can logically explain why the conclusion is not true.\n4. Consider each option and evaluate whether it provides a logical explanation for the conclusion.\n5. Choose the option that provides the best logical explanation for the conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Be careful when negating statements, as the negation may not always be true.\n - Do not assume the truth value of a statement without evidence or logical reasoning.\n - Consider each option carefully and evaluate whether it provides a logical explanation for the problem.\n - Eliminate options that are clearly false or irrelevant."
