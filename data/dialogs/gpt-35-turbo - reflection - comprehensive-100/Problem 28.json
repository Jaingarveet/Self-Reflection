Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?\nChoices:\n  A: the first, third, and fourth\n  B: the second, third, and fourth\n  C: the third and fourth\n  D: the third and fifth\n  E: the fourth and fifth\n\nThought:\nThe third solo is a traditional piece.\nExactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\nNo traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nTherefore, Wayne must perform a modern piece first.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
