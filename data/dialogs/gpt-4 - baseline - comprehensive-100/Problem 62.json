Here, I will use the elimination method. \nFirst, I will multiply the second equation by 3 and the first equation by 1 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal. \nThis gives: \n3x + 4y = -23\n6y - 3x = -57\nAdding these two equations together, we get:\n10y = -80\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\ny = -8\nSubstituting y = -8 into the first equation, we get:\n3x + 4*(-8) = -23\n3x - 32 = -23\n3x = 9\nx = 3\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is (x, y) = (3, -8).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
