Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\n"

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nIf Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we need to find a sequence that fits these conditions. \nOption A: Helen, George, and Nina - This doesn't work because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, but Helen has already given a report on Monday.\nOption B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This doesn't work because George must give a report on Tuesday, but Robert is listed for Tuesday.\nOption C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This works because George gives a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert give an afternoon report. Also, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, which is possible.\nOption D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This doesn't work because George must give a report on Tuesday, but Robert is listed for Tuesday.\nOption E: Robert, George, and Helen - This doesn't work because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, but Helen has already given a report on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
