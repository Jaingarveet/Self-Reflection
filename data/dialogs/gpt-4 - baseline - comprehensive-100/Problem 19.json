This absurdity arises from the combination of the two statements \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\". If we assume that \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" is true (which is a metaphorical way of saying friends are valuable), then the absurdity must arise from the statement \"Money is like dung\". Therefore, if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
