Since we know that at least one of them is tall (Liu Dawei), they must both be tall.\n- This means that the tall men are Liu Dawei, Li Qiang, and Wu Gang, and Wang Wei is not tall.\n- Since there is only one handsome man and he must be a tall doctor, the handsome man must be Wu Gang, as he is the only tall doctor.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
