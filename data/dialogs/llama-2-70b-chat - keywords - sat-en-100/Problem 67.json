He is no longer \"obsessed\" with the gold, and instead, he looks forward to a different kind of future. The passage also mentions that Eppie has brought about a change in Silas' life, awakening him from his \"cold, narrow prison\" and introducing him to a new world of hope and anticipation. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\nError Analysis:\nIn my previous answer, I selected option A, which is incorrect. I was obsessed with the idea of Silas renouncing his desire for money, which led me to overlook the actual changes that Eppie brought about in Silas' life. I was trapped in my own narrow perspective and failed to see the broader picture. I realize now that the passage does not mention anything about Silas' attitude towards money, and that my previous answer was based on an incorrect interpretation of the text."
