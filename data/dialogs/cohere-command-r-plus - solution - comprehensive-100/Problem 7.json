The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?\nChoices:\n  A: 40.8\n  B: 41.6\n  C: 42.2\n  D: 43.5\n  E: 44.8\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe average of the 10 vehicles' weights is $12.2$ tons, so their total weight is $10 \\times 12.2 = 122$ tons. After adding the new truck, the average weight increased to $12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8$ tons, and the total weight increased to $14.8 \\times 11 = 162.8$ tons. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is $162.8 - 122 = \\mathbf{[REDACTED]}$ tons.\n"
