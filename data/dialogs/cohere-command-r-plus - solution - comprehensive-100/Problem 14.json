If the human resources department is on the first floor, the administration department must be on the second floor, and the planning department is on the third floor (as it is below the administration department). This leaves the finance department to be on the fourth floor, with the sales and R&D departments on the fifth and sixth floors, respectively. \n2. If human resources are on the second floor, the planning department must be on the first floor (as it is below the administration department), with finance on the third floor. Again, this leaves the sales and R&D departments on the fifth and sixth floors, respectively. \n3. If human resources occupy the third floor, the planning department must be on the first floor, with finance on the second floor. The administration department can then be on the fourth floor, with sales and R&D on the fifth and sixth floors, respectively. \n\nTherefore, the sales department could be on the fifth floor (i.e., one level above the R&D department), making statement A a possible correct answer.\n\nStatement B states that the sales department is one level above the administration department. However, this is not possible, as the human resources department must be between these two departments, according to the given information.\n\nStatement C suggests that the sales department is next to the planning department. This is also not feasible, as the finance department must occupy the floor adjacent to the planning department.\n\nStatement D places the sales department on the second floor. If this were the case, the human resources department would have to be on the first floor, leaving no space for the planning department (as it cannot be on the sixth floor, due to the relative positions of the administration and human resources departments).\n\nHence, the correct answer is A.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
