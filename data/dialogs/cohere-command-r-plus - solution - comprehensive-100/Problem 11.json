This weakens the argument to some extent, but it does not directly contradict the assertion. \n\nChoice [REDACTED] presents a scenario where Beijing's residential prices increased while land prices remained almost unchanged, rising by only 0.37%. This directly contradicts the assertion and is the most effective at casting doubt on the claim. \n\nChoice [REDACTED] supports the assertion, as it states that increasing land development costs will lead to higher house prices. \n\nChoice [REDACTED] provides an alternative explanation for soaring housing prices, but it does not address the role of land prices and therefore does not directly refute the assertion.\n"
