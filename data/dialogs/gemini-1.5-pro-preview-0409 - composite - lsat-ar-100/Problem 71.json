Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

We know:\n*   More representatives are in Zone 3 than Zone 2.\n*   Parra and Quinn are together.\n*   Stuckey and Udall are together. \nTherefore, Zone 3 must have at least one of the pairs, and cannot have just Kim and Mahr. This eliminates options A and B. Option C is also not possible because it violates the constraint of Zone 3 having more representatives than Zone 2. \nThe correct answer must include either Parra and Quinn or Stuckey and Udall, along with at least one more person. This leaves us with options D and E. However, option D is impossible because Tiao and Udall cannot be in the same zone. \nTherefore, the only possible list for Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
