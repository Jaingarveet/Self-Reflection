K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

Also, the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.\n2. **Fixed Positions:** \n    * I is on the middle shelf.\n    * K is above F.\n    * O is above L.\n    * F and M are on the same shelf.\n3. **New Constraint:** L is on a higher shelf than H.\n## Deductions:\n* **L and O Placement:** Since O is above L and L is above H, both O and L must be on the top shelf. This leaves the middle and bottom shelves for the remaining 6 books.\n* **K and F Placement:** K being above F eliminates the possibility of them being on the top shelf (already occupied by O and L). So, K must be on the middle shelf with I, and F (along with M) must be on the bottom shelf.\n* **Remaining Books:** We have G and H left. Since the bottom shelf needs more books than the top (which has 2), both G and H must go to the bottom shelf with F and M.\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, **G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
