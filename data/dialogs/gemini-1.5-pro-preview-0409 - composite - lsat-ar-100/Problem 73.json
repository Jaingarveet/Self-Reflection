The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

If Jiang and O'Neill are the pair reviewing the same plays (Tamerlane and Undulation), Megregian could review Sunset and Tamerlane.\n*   **B:** Impossible. O'Neill must be part of the pair reviewing the same plays, and we know one of those plays is Undulation.\n*   **C:** Impossible. Jiang cannot share reviews with either Lopez or Megregian.\n*   **D:** Possible. If Lopez and O'Neill are the pair reviewing the same plays (Tamerlane and Undulation), Lopez wouldn't review any of Jiang's plays.\n*   **E:** Possible. If Jiang and O'Neill are the pair reviewing the same plays (Tamerlane and Undulation), O'Neill could also review Sunset.\n## Conclusion:\nOptions A, D, and E are possible. However, since the prompt asks for **one** possible scenario, we can choose any of them. \n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
