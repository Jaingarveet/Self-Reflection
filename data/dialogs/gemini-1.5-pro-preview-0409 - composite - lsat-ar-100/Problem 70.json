Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target\n  B: Image's voicemail target\n  C: Solide's website target\n  D: Truvest's voicemail target\n  E: Truvest's website target\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

We know:\n*   Website targets are always equal to or shorter than voicemail targets for the same client.\n*   Image's voicemail is the shortest.\n*   Solide's website is shorter than Truvest's website.\n*   Solide's voicemail is shorter than Truvest's website.\nIf Solide's voicemail is shorter than Truvest's website, and website targets are always equal to or shorter than voicemail targets, then Solide's website must also be shorter than Truvest's website. This creates a chain of targets shorter than 2 days: Solide's website < Solide's voicemail < Truvest's website. \nTherefore, the only option that could be 2 days is Truvest's voicemail target. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
