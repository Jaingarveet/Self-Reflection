The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.\n  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

This will help me avoid repeating the same mistake.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Kayne to Yemen:** We know Kayne is assigned to Yemen. This immediately tells us Novetzke is NOT assigned to any ambassadorship due to the constraint \"Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both.\"\n2. **Jaramillo and Kayne:** The constraint \"If Jaramillo is assigned, then so is Kayne\" doesn't provide additional information here since Kayne is already assigned. \n3. **Ong and Venezuela:** The constraint \"If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned to Yemen\" is irrelevant because Kayne IS assigned to Yemen. So, Ong could be assigned to Venezuela or another country, or not assigned at all.\n4. **Landon and Zambia:** The constraint \"If Landon is assigned, it is to Zambia\" doesn't provide definitive information. Landon could be in Zambia or not assigned at all.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only definitive conclusion we can draw when Kayne is assigned to Yemen is that **Novetzke is not assigned to an ambassadorship**.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
