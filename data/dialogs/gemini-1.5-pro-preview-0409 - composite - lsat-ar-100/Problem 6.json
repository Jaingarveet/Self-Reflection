The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

Let's carefully analyze each option considering this:\n*   **A:** We know Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, but Jiang's review count relative to Lopez is uncertain. \n*   **B:**  Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, but Jiang's review count is still uncertain.\n*   **C:**  We only know Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, not necessarily O'Neill.\n*   **D:** Similar to A and B, O'Neill and Jiang's review counts are not directly comparable based on the given information.\n*   **E:**  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and since they can't both be the pair with identical reviews, one must review more plays. This is the only option that must be true. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
