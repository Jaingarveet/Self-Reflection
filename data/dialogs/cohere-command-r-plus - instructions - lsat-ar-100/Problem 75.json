Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

Kramer and O’Neill review Tamerlane and possibly other plays, so they are not suitable choices for reviewing only Sunset. Jiang does not review any plays that Lopez reviews, so they could have distinct plays or there could be overlap; therefore, Jiang could potentially review only Sunset, but we cannot definitively place her with this play.'](https://www.arsbot.io/reflect/law-multiple-choice-question-5-reflection/)\n\nThought: Given that exactly two students review the same plays, and Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, it can be deduced that Lopez and Megregian review the same plays, and these plays are distinct from those reviewed by Jiang. This is because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any plays that Jiang reviews. Therefore, Lopez and Megregian could have reviewed Sunset and/or Undulation, but not Tamerlane. As Sunset is the only play they could have reviewed, this must be the play they both reviewed.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
