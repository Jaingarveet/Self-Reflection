At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions provided in the prompt and list them clearly. \n2. Interpret each condition carefully and systematically. \n3. Eliminate choices that violate any of the conditions. \n4. Pay close attention to detail and ensure you don't overlook any conditions or details. \n5. Double-check your interpretation and reasoning for each step.\n"
