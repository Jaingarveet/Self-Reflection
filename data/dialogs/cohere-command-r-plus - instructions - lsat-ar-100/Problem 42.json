The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify and clearly understand each of the given conditions. \n2. Break down each condition and determine its impact on the selection. \n3. Analyze each choice by applying the conditions to the selection of botanists, chemists, and zoologists. \n4. Look for any condition that is not met or any restriction that is violated. \n5. Choose the option that satisfies all the conditions without violating any restrictions.\n"

This rules out the previous answer.\n\nCondition application:\n- The panel must include at least one of each type: botanist, chemist, and zoologist.\n- If more than one botanist is selected, then only one zoologist is chosen.\n- Specific scientist combinations are excluded: FK, KM.\n- If M is chosen, both P and R must be chosen.\n\nChoice analysis:\n- A: Includes F and K, violating the FK condition.\n- B: Violates the rule that M, P, and R must all be selected together.\n- C: Does not include M, so the condition of selecting M with P and R is not applicable.\n- D: Satisfies all the conditions. It includes one of each type and follows the rules for combinations.\n- E: Violates the rule that M, P, and R must be selected together.\n\nAnswer: \nBy process of elimination and considering the reflection, the correct answer is D: H, K, M, P, and R."
