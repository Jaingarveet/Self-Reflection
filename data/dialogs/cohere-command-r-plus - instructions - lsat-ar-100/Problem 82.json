Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions provided in the question. \n2. Visually organize the conditions using a table or diagram to help understand the relationships. \n3. Analyze each choice, step-by-step, by comparing it to the conditions. \n4. Eliminate choices that contradict the conditions. \n5. Identify the choice that satisfies all conditions or the most conditions, if a perfect match is not found.\n"
