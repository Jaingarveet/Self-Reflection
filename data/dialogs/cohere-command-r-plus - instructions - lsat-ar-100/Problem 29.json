        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given condition: L is on a higher shelf than H.\n2. Determine the placement of O based on its condition.\n3. Allocate two books to the top shelf and consider the remaining options for the middle and bottom shelves.\n4. Place K higher than F and consider the implications for shelf arrangement.\n5. Identify that F and M are on the same shelf, and consider the options for their placement.\n6. Evaluate the arrangements for each choice, considering the placement of G, H, I, and K.\n7. Determine the arrangement that satisfies all conditions and choose the corresponding answer choice.\n"
