The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  B: Jaramillo and Ong\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Ong\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read and understand the context and constraints carefully.\n2. Identify the given constraints:\n    - Landon, if assigned, must go to Zambia.\n    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned.\n    - If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.\n    - If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.\n3. Deduce the assignments based on the constraints:\n    - Landon is assigned to Zambia.\n    - Kayne and Jaramillo can be assigned, but not with Ong assigned to Venezuela.\n    - Novetzke cannot be assigned due to the constraint.\n4. Determine the pair of candidates who are not assigned:\n    - Given the above, it is clear that [REDACTED] are the pair who are not assigned.\n5. Choose the answer choice that reflects this deduction.\n"
