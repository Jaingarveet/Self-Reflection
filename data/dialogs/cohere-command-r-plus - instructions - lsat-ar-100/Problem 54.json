The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions and relationships between the students and their play reviews.\n2. Interpret the conditions correctly, especially the one stating that exactly two students have the same play selection.\n3. Deduce the possible play combinations for each student, considering the conditions.\n4. Eliminate options that do not satisfy the conditions.\n5. Recognize that the correct answer is not provided and respond accordingly.\n"

This is a more specific and restrictive condition.\n\nNow, recognizing that Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, and that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, we can deduce the following:\n\nKramer and O'Neill: Must review Tamerlane, and one other play each (either Sunset or Undulation) without overlapping with Megregian's choices.\n\nLopez and Megregian: Their play choices cannot overlap with Jiang's, and Megregian must review more plays than Lopez.\n\nWith these deductions, we can eliminate options that contradict the given conditions. However, none of the provided options satisfy all the conditions, which means the correct answer is not listed.\n\nAction: The correct answer is not listed."
