Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions: Jackson testifies on Monday, exactly two witnesses on Tuesday, Franco and Garcia don't testify together, Iturbe on Wednesday, and Hong not on Monday.\n2. Start with the condition that has the least flexible options; Jackson testifies on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday. \n3. Build the schedule from there: Tuesday has two witnesses, so it could be Franco and Garcia, or Franco and Hong, or Garcia and Hong. \n4. Apply the remaining conditions: Franco and Garcia cannot testify together, so they must testify on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. \n5. Finalize the schedule: Monday - Jackson, Tuesday - Hong and Garcia, Wednesday - Iturbe and Franco.\n"
