Non-negotiable conditions:\n   - Tuesday is the only day for George.\n   - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.\n2. Conditions related to Nina, Helen, and Irving:\n   - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's construct a schedule that meets these conditions:\n1. We know Tuesday is for George, so let's place him in the morning to keep options open for afternoon placements.\n2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they should be placed in the morning slots.\n3. Nina, Helen, and Irving must be placed together over two consecutive days, and Nina should be in the morning to allow for afternoon placements.\n\nA possible schedule that meets these conditions:\n**Monday:**\n- Morning: Nina\n- Afternoon: Helen\n**Tuesday:**\n- Morning: George\n- Afternoon: Irving\n**Wednesday:**\n- Morning: Olivia\n- Afternoon: Robert\n\nThis schedule ensures that all conditions are met, and it adheres to the requirement of two reports given each day over three consecutive days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not among the provided choices, as none of them satisfy all the conditions.
