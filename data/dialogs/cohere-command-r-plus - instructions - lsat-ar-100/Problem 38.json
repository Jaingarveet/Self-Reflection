At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions and rules. \n2. Understand the question: If G is on the top shelf, which books could be on the middle shelf? \n3. For each choice, assess if it satisfies all conditions. \n4. Eliminate choices that contradict any condition. \n5. Choose the answer that remains viable after this process.\n"

The middle shelf must contain book I, and book K must be on a higher shelf than book F. Additionally, book O is on a higher shelf than book L, and book F shares a shelf with book M. If book G is on the top shelf, this would leave H, I, K, L, and O for the middle and bottom shelves. As there are an odd number of books left, the middle shelf must have three books to ensure the bottom shelf has the most books.\n\nThought: With G on the top shelf, the middle shelf must contain three books to ensure the bottom shelf has the most.
