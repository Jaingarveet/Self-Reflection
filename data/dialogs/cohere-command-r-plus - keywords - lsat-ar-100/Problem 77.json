Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overly restrictive interpretation\n- Rule misunderstanding\n"

This resulted in an overly restrictive interpretation, limiting the possibilities for other employees.\n\nCorrect answer: B\n\nThought: \nYoung must be assigned a higher number than Togowa, and Xu must be higher than Souza, but Robertson has the option of #1, #2, #3, or #4, limiting the options for the employees that must be placed higher or lower than them.\n\nTogowa can be assigned any space from #1 to #5.\nSouza can be assigned any space from #1 to #4.\nYoung must be assigned space #5 or #6 due to Robertson taking one of the higher spaces.\nXu must be assigned space #4, #5, or #6.\nRobertson can be assigned spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nVaughn has all six spaces available.\n\nOnly Young and Xu have their options limited to two possible spaces each, so the answer is B."
