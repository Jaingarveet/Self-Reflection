The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.

This means that the shoe store must occupy space 3.\n\nNow, we need to place the remaining businesses while adhering to the other constraints.\n\nThe toy store cannot go in space 4 because it cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nSo, the restaurants must be placed in spaces 4 and 6, with two businesses separating them.\n\nThis leaves spaces 5 and 7 for the veterinarian and toy store, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store are the pharmacy and a restaurant.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
