The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Condition misinterpretation\n"

This option meets the conditions with one botanist (G), one chemist (K), and one zoologist (R).\n\nOption D includes M, triggering the condition that P and R must also be included. However, this option violates the condition that only one zoologist can be selected if there are two botanists (H and K).\n\nOption E includes M, and therefore must include P and R. This option has only one chemist and no botanists, not fulfilling the requirements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
