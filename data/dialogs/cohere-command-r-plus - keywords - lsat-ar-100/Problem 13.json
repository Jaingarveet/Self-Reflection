At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Assumption\n- Logical error\n"

However, the question specifies that Franco testifying with Hong means they share a day, and that this day cannot be the same as Garcia's. As such, the correct answer is B: Garcia testifies on Monday.\n\nThought: Given my reflection, the correct answer is clear: if Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and that day cannot be the same as Garcia's, then Garcia must testify on Monday.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
