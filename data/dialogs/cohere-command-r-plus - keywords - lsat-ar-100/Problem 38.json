As F and M are on the same shelf, this means that K, M, and F cannot be on the middle shelf. This leaves options A, B, and C as possibilities. \n\nWe also know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and that at least two books are placed on each shelf. This means that there can only be two books on the top shelf, and G is one of them. Therefore, only options A and B are possible, as options C, D, and E would mean that there are three books on the top shelf. \n\nFinally, we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf, eliminating option B. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: H, I.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
