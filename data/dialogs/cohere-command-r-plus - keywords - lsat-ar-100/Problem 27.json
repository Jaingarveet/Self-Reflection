The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Incomplete list\n- Overlooked constraint\n"

        "content": "Reflection: I misinterpreted the clue \"Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\" I thought that only these two students reviewed the play, but the question actually asks for a list of ALL the students who reviewed Tamerlane, which could include other students besides Kramer and O'Neill.\n\nI also overlooked the constraint that exactly two students reviewed the same plays. This means that only two students could have reviewed Tamerlane, so the correct answer must include exactly two names.\n\nCorrect answer explanation: We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two students reviewed the same plays, so that means only one other person besides Kramer and O'Neill could have also reviewed Tamerlane. This eliminates choices A, C, and E, as these have either one or three names. Choice D can be eliminated because we're told that Lopez and Megregian don't review any plays that Jiang reviews, and we know that Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane (because Kramer and O'Neill are the only two who do). Therefore, the correct answer is B: Kramer and O'Neill.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
