Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

I assumed that because Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, he must give a report on Tuesday. However, this assumption neglected the condition that only two reports can be given each day. As a result, I incorrectly selected an answer choice that included George giving a report on Tuesday, when in fact, he could have given a report on Tuesday morning if and only if no other reports were given on Monday or Wednesday.\n\nThought: \nIf Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. We know that Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, and he must give a morning report. From the conditions, we also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they can only give morning reports.\n\nOn Tuesday, George can give a morning report. If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day (Wednesday). This would mean that Nina could give a report on Monday or Tuesday. However, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since George already gave a report on Tuesday morning. So, Nina must give a report on Monday, with Helen and Irving giving reports on Tuesday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is morning reports by Nina, Helen, and Irving on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
