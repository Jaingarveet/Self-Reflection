The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.

I correctly identified that O must be performed first in this scenario, but I failed to consider the requirement that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
