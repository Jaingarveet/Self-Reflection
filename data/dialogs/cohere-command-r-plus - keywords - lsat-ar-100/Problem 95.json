The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.

Instead, bay 5 could hold produce, and bay 4 could hold textiles, which still satisfies the clue.\n\nThought: \nBay 5 could hold produce and bay 4 could hold textiles.\nBay 6 must hold grain since it is the highest numbered bay remaining.\nBay 3 could hold livestock since it must be higher numbered than textiles (bay 4) but lower numbered than grain (bay 6).\nBay 2 could hold fuel since produce (bay 5) must be higher numbered than fuel.\nBay 1 is the only bay left and must hold machinery.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
