However, the constraint actually allows for more French novels than Russian novels, as long as the minimum of three novels selected includes at least one French novel.\n\nCorrect answer: The organizer must select at least one French novel and one other work that can be either a French play or a Russian novel. This fulfills the requirements of having at least three novels (including at least one French novel), no more than four French works, and having at least as many French novels as Russian novels.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
