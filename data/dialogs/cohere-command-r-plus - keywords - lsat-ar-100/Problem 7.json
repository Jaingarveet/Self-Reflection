Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Assumption\n\nSolution: Given that Jackson testifies on Monday and Hong cannot testify on Monday, Hong must testify on Tuesday. With two witnesses testifying on Tuesday, and Franco and Garcia not testifying on the same day, it must be the case that Franco and Garcia testify on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. This leaves Monday with Jackson and Wednesday with Iturbe and Franco.\n"
