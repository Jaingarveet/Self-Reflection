Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation error\n- Overlooked options\n- Insufficient analysis\n"

This error led me to conclude that Zone 1 had the most employees, which is not necessarily true. A correct interpretation would be that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and this information alone does not determine which zone has the most employees.\n\nThought: Given that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, it is possible that Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1, leaving Tiao out of the equation. This scenario would mean that Zone 1 has more representatives than Zone 3, meeting the condition. Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
