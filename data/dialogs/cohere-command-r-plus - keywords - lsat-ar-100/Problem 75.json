The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Assumption error\n - Logical error\n\nSolution: Given that Kramer and [REDACTED] reviewed Tamerlane, they cannot be included in the list of students who reviewed only Sunset. We also know that Jiang reviewed a different play than [REDACTED] and Megregian. Therefore, the only student who could have reviewed only Sunset is [REDACTED], making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.\n"
