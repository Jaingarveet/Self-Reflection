This means that choices C and E can be eliminated, as they would result in an equal or lesser number of people in Zone 3 compared to Zone 2. Upon further analysis, choice B can also be eliminated because it would violate the condition that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. This leaves choices A and D as the only possible options, and so the correct answer is \"Either A or D.\"\n\nAction: Answer(\"A or D\")"
