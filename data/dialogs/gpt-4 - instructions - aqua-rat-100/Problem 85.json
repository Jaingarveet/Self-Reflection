If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?\nChoices:\n  A: 1 step/minute\n  B: 2 step/minute\n  C: 3 step/minute\n  D: 4 step/minute\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem: you are walking down steps while the elevator is moving.\n2. Identify the number of steps you walk and the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom in each scenario.\n3. Realize that the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom is the time it takes for the elevator to cover the remaining steps after you stop walking.\n4. Understand that since this time does not change between scenarios, the speed of the elevator is constant.\n5. Calculate the speed of the elevator by dividing the number of steps you walk by the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated speed.\n"

Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding of it. However, I have to choose an answer, so I will choose the one that matches one of the calculated speeds.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
