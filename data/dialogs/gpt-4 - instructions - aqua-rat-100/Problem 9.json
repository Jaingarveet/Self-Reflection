If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 16\n  C: 24\n  D: 30\n  E: 40\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand that the profit is calculated based on the cost price, not the selling price.\n2. Calculate the cost price per bag by dividing the selling price by 1 plus the profit percentage.\n3. Calculate the profit per bag by subtracting the cost price from the selling price.\n4. Divide the total profit by the profit per bag to find the number of bags sold.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"
