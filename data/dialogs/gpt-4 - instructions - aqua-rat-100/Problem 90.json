The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We can set up the equation as follows: 4*2x (cost for Sunday's newspapers) + 1*6x (cost for newspapers from Monday to Saturday) = $210.\nAction: \nFirst, simplify the equation: 8x + 6x = $210.\nThen, combine like terms: 14x = $210.\nFinally, solve for x: x = $210 / 14 = 15.\nAnswer: Answer(\"A\")"
