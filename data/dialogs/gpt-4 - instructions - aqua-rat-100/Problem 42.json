The total length for each picket including the space is 1/2 inch + 6 inches = 6.5 inches.\n3. The total length for x pickets including the space is 6.5x inches.\n4. After the last picket, there is no space, so we subtract 6 inches from the total length, which gives us 6.5x - 6 inches.\n5. To convert this length from inches to feet, we divide by 12, which gives us (6.5x - 6)/12 feet.\n6. Simplifying this expression gives us (13x - 12)/24 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
