So, we can write the equation as follows: 7/8*x - 7/18*x = 770.\n3. The common denominator for 8 and 18 is 72.\n4. Rewrite the equation using the common denominator: (63/72)*x - (28/72)*x = 770.\n5. Combine the fractions on the left side of the equation: (35/72)*x = 770.\n6. To solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the fraction on the left side: x = 770 * (72/35).\n7. Calculate the value of x: x = 1584.\n8. Double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n9. The answer that matches the calculated result is 1584.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
