Identify the shape and dimensions of the paper.\n2. Calculate the area of the paper.\n3. Identify the shape and dimensions of the cutouts.\n4. Calculate the area of each cutout.\n5. Multiply the area of one cutout by the number of cutouts to find the total area of the cutouts.\n6. Subtract the total area of the cutouts from the area of the paper to find the remaining area.\n7.

The cutouts are semi-circles with diameters of 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm.\n4. The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of a semi-circle is (πr^2)/2 = (π(10^2))/2 = 50π cm^2.\n5. There are two cutouts, so the total area of the cutouts is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.\n6. The remaining area of the paper is 400 - 100π = 400 - 314.16 = 85.84 cm^2.\n7. The units are already in cm^2, so no conversion is necessary.\n8. None of the choices match the calculated result. There seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.\nAction: \nSince the calculated result does not match any of the choices and I must select one of the available choices, I will choose the closest one.\nAnswer(\"E\")"
