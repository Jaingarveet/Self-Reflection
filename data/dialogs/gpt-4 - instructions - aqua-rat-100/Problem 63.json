The team won 20 matches, so the rest of the matches (X - 20) were lost. \n4. According to the problem, the team lost 30% of their matches, so (X - 20) = 0.30X. \n5. Solving this equation for X gives X = 20 / (1 - 0.30) = 28.57, which we round up to 29 because the number of matches must be a whole number. \n6. The number of lost matches is X - 20 = 29 - 20 = 9. \n7. However, none of the answer choices match this result. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem or the answer choices. Let's try a different approach. \n8. If we assume that the 20 matches won are part of the 70% of matches not lost, then we can calculate the total number of matches as 20 / 0.70 = 28.57, which we round up to 29. \n9. Then the number of lost matches would be 30% of 29, which is 8.7, rounded to 9. \n10. Again, none of the answer choices match this result. \n11. Let's try one more approach. If we assume that the 20 matches won are part of the total matches, then the lost matches would be 30% of the total matches. \n12. In this case, the total number of matches would be 20 / (1 - 0.30) = 28.57, rounded up to 29. \n13. The number of lost matches would then be 30% of 29, which is 8.7, rounded to 9. \n14.
