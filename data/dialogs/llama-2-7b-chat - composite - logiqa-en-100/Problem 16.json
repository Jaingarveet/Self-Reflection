This is the hypothesis discussed by the economist, which is option [REDACTED].\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the economist is not suggesting that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the economist is not discussing the existence of polluting enterprises in both developed and developing countries.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the economist is not suggesting that the degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious than in developing countries.\n\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Identify the key points and assumptions made in the argument.\n* Use the information provided in the argument to support your answer.\n* Eliminate any incorrect options based on the information provided.\n* Choose the best answer based on the information provided.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
