The correct answer is (C) One of the functions of personal income tax is to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor.\n\nExplanation:\nThe official's argument that the starting point for personal income tax should not be too high because it will deprive low-income earners the honor of being the most taxpayers is not entirely accurate. While it is true that low-income earners may be more likely to pay taxes if the starting point is too high, it is also important to consider the broader social implications of personal income tax. One of the functions of personal income tax is to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor. By taxing higher-income earners at a higher rate than lower-income earners, personal income tax can help reduce income inequality and promote social justice.\n\n(A) All countries in the world levy pre-tax deductions on residents' basic living expenses when collecting personal income tax to ensure the reproduction of social labor is not directly relevant to the official's argument. While it is true that many countries do implement pre-tax deductions, the specific starting point for personal income tax is not necessarily determined by international practice.\n\n(B) A low personal income tax will also affect the honor of low-income earners as taxpayers is a valid point, but it does not directly address the issue of social distribution and inequality. While it is true that low-income earners may be more likely to pay taxes if the starting point is too high, it is also important to consider the broader social implications of personal income tax.\n\n(D) China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes is not directly relevant to the official's argument. While it is true that China does have a significant commodity tax base, personal income tax is an important component of the overall tax system, and the starting point for personal income tax can have significant implications for social distribution and inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (C) One of the functions of personal income tax is to regulate social distribution and narrow the gap between rich and poor. This answer choice best addresses the issue raised by the official and provides a logical explanation for why personal income tax should not have a too high starting point."
