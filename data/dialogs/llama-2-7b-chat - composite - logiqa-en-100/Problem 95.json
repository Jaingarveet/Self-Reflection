He was not referring to the difficulty of living a good life for 1.3 billion people, but rather the impact of China's large population on its affairs.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - China's large population makes China's affairs very complicated and arduous, so remember to be cautious for politicians.\n\nExplanation: Premier Wen Jiabao's statement highlights the challenges that come with having a large population, particularly in terms of managing and addressing the needs of such a vast number of people. By multiplying a small problem by 1.3 billion, the issue becomes much more significant, and by dividing a large total by 1.3 billion, the number becomes much smaller. This is what Premier Wen Jiabao meant by \"a big number.\""
