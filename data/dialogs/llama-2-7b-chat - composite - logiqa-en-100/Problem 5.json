Here is my self-reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* In most cases, the people do not know what they really need. (A)\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is (B) Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument states that free speech is essential for a healthy country, as it allows government officials to hear demand messages from the people. However, if free speech ultimately disrupts social order, it can make it difficult for the government to meet the needs of the people. Therefore, option (B) is the correct answer.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen answering this question, it is important to carefully consider the argument and the options provided. It is essential to recognize that free speech can have both positive and negative effects on social order, and to weigh the potential benefits against the potential drawbacks. By carefully evaluating the argument and the options, you can arrive at the correct answer."
