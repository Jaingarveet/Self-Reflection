(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the conditions provided, we need to assign the patients to the doctors in a way that meets all the requirements.\n\nDr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients, so he cannot treat J or K.\nDr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, so she cannot treat more than 1 patient.\nDr.Wang is responsible for treating adult patients, so he cannot treat J or K.\n\nFrom the patient list, we can see that:\n\n* J and K are children (male and female, respectively).\n* E, F, and H are adults (male and female, respectively).\n\nSo, we need to assign J and K to doctors who are responsible for treating male patients, and E, F, and H to doctors who are responsible for treating adult patients.\n\nThe only possible assignment of patients to doctors is:\n\n* J is treated by Dr.Li (as she is the only doctor who can treat a child patient and has no other patients to treat).\n* K is treated by Dr.Wang (as he is the only doctor who can treat a child patient and has no other patients to treat).\n* E is treated by Dr.Zhang (as he is the only doctor who can treat a male adult patient).\n* F is treated by Dr.Liu (as she is the only doctor who can treat a female adult patient).\n* H is treated by Dr.Li (as she is the only doctor who can treat a male adult patient).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) [REDACTED] is treated by Dr.Liu.\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
