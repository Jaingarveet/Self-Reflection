However, this is not the correct interpretation of the sentence.\n\nOption (C) is also not a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that one should not treat others unless they want to. The sentence does not suggest that treating others is conditional on their willingness.\n\nOption (D) is also not a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that whatever is applied to people should be what they want.
