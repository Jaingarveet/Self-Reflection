Xiao Wang did not disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument. Instead, Xiao Wang used a logical argument to refute Xiao Chen's views.\n\nHere is my revised answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nXiao Wang used logical reasoning to refute Xiao Chen's views. Xiao Chen claimed that the flicker light discovered by the solar telescope must be an unusual scene, but Xiao Wang argued that this conclusion is not logical. Xiao Wang pointed out that comets far away from the sun are not normally observed, but the flicker light was obtained through continuous and careful tracking observation. Therefore, the flicker light must be due to some other reason.\n\nIn this answer, Xiao Wang did not disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument. Instead, Xiao Wang used logical reasoning to refute Xiao Chen's views by pointing out the inconsistency in Xiao Chen's argument."
