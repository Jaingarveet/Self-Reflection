In the 1950s, the grass in Xilin Gol grassland was tall enough to cover a horse's belly, but now it can't even cover mice. This indicates that there may be other factors contributing to the sand and dust storms in the region, beyond just grassland degradation and desertification.\n\nOption [REDACTED] suggests that the increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands. This is a plausible explanation, as human activities can indeed have a significant impact on the environment and contribute to desertification. Therefore, the opinion that sand and dust storms are solely caused by natural disasters may be questioned based on the given information.\n\nThe other options do not provide sufficient evidence to challenge the opinion that sand and dust storms in the Inner Mongolia region are caused by grassland degradation and desertification due to climate drought. Option [REDACTED] does not provide any information about the height of grass in the region, while option [REDACTED] simply states that the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high, which does not contradict the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification. Option [REDACTED] does not provide any information about the height of grass in the region, and does not address the issue of human factors contributing to desertification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
