I will reflect on my previous solution and the correct answer.\n\nAction:\nI will analyze the given conditions and the options available for each department.\n\nReflection:\n\n1. Condition (1): H and Y must be allocated in the same department. This means that H and Y cannot be allocated in different departments.\n2. Condition (2): F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. This means that F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. Condition (3): If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. This means that X cannot be allocated in the production department, and W cannot be allocated in the sales department.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options available for each department:\n\nSales Department: A, B, C, and D\nProduction Department: E, F, G, and H\nPublic Relations Department: I and J\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that:\n\n* A and B are both in the sales department, which violates condition (2).\n* C and D are both in the sales department, which violates condition (1).\n* G and Y are in the same department, which violates condition (1).\n* H and W are in the same department, which violates condition (3).\n\nTherefore, the pair of employees that is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department is:\n\nB: G and X\n\nExplanation:\nG and X are both in the sales department, which violates condition (2). Therefore, it is unlikely that they will be assigned to the sales department.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving this problem, it is essential to carefully analyze the given conditions and the options available for each department. It is also important to pay attention to the constraints provided in the problem and to use them to eliminate incorrect options."
