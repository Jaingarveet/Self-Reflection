The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Manx are featured on day 3.\n  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.\n  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.\n  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.\n\n  Thought: \nIf Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they must be featured on days 3, 5, and 7, as they are featured on exactly three days and cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7.\nSince Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, they must be featured on day 6.\nSiamese cannot be featured on day 4, as Himalayans are not featured on day 3.\nManx cannot be featured on day 3, as Himalayans are not featured on day 2.\nGreyhounds are already featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on day 7.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

Greyhounds are featured on day 1.\n2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\n3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.\n4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.\n5.
