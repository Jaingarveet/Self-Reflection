Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\n  Thought: \nThe given conditions can be represented as:\n\n* More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf\n* I is on the middle shelf\n* K is on a higher shelf than F\n* O is on a higher shelf than L\n* F is on the same shelf as M\n\nFrom the given conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n* The top shelf has 2 books, the middle shelf has 3 books, and the bottom shelf has 3 books.\n* I is on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.\n* K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.\n* O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf.\n* F is on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf together.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nThis choice does not provide any new information and does not help determine the shelves for all the books.\n\nB: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nThis choice is inconsistent with the given conditions, as K is on a higher shelf than F, and G is not on the top shelf.\n\nC: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nThis choice is inconsistent with the given conditions, as L is on the bottom shelf and F is on a higher shelf.\n\nD: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nThis choice is consistent with the given conditions, as M and H can be on the bottom shelf together.\n\nE: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nThis choice is inconsistent with the given conditions, as H is on the bottom shelf and O is on a higher shelf.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
