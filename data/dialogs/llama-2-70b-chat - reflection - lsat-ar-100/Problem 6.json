The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\n\n  Answer: \"B\"\n\nExplanation:\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n1.
