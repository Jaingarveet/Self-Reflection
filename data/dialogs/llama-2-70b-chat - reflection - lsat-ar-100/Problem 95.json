Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists could accurately identify the cargo held in each of the loading dock's first three bays, listed in order from bay 1 to bay 3?\nChoices:\n  A: fuel, machinery, textiles\n  B: grain, machinery, fuel\n  C: machinery, livestock, fuel\n  D: machinery, textiles, fuel\n  E: machinery, textiles, produce\n\n  Thought: \nThe question provides us with the following information:\n* Grain is in a higher numbered bay than livestock.\n* Livestock is in a higher numbered bay than textiles.\n* Produce is in a higher numbered bay than fuel.\n* Textiles are next to produce.\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following:\n* Bay 1: Fuel (since it's in a lower numbered bay than produce)\n* Bay 2: Textiles (since it's next to produce and in a higher numbered bay than livestock)\n* Bay 3: Machinery (since it's in a higher numbered bay than fuel and not in conflict with any other cargo)\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question by relying on the information that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, without considering the other constraints provided in the question.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Overlooking information\n* Not considering all constraints\n* Jumping to conclusions\n\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the question again, taking into account all the given constraints:\n\n1. Grain is in a higher numbered bay than livestock.\n2. Livestock is in a higher numbered bay than textiles.\n3. Produce is in a higher numbered bay than fuel.\n4. Textiles are next to produce.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce the following:\n\n* Bay 1: Fuel (since it's in a lower numbered bay than produce)\n* Bay 2: Textiles (since it's next to produce and in a higher numbered bay than livestock)\n* Bay 3: Grain (since it's in a higher numbered bay than livestock and not in conflict with any other cargo)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and make a note of all the given constraints.\n2. Analyze the constraints and deduce the possible cargo for each bay.\n3. Check for any conflicts between the cargo and the constraints.\n4. Select the answer that matches the deduced cargo for the first three bays.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the given information.\n* Take your time to analyze the question and consider all the constraints.\n* Don't jump to conclusions based on partial information.\n* Double-check your answer by going through the constraints again.\n* Remember that the correct answer might not always be the most intuitive one."
