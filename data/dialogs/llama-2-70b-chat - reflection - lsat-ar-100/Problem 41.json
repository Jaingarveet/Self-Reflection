Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.\n  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n\n  Answer: C\n\nTheresa tests G on the second day, so she cannot test H on the second day. \nSince Theresa must test H, she must test it on the first day. \nTherefore, the statement \"Theresa tests H on the first day\" is true.\n\nThe given information states that Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F or G on the first day. \nSince Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki must test F on the first day. \nSo, the statement \"Yuki tests F on the first day\" is true.\n\nThe given information also states that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. \nTherefore, Seamus must test F on the second day.\n\nThe given information states that Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G or J on the first day. \nSince Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. \nSo, the statement \"Reynaldo tests J on the first day\" is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
