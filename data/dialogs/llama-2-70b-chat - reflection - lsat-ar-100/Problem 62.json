        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.\n  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n\n  Thought: \nIf Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then, by the given constraints:\n* Either Novetzke or Kayne, but not both, can be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Thus, Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen.\n* If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Venezuela.\n* If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which means Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.\n* Landon must be assigned to Zambia.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
