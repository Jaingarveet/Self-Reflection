The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nQuestion: If the works selected include three French novels, which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the remaining works selected?\nChoices:\n  A: one Russian novel\n  B: two French plays\n  C: one Russian novel, one Russian play\n  D: one Russian novel, two French plays\n  E: two Russian novels, one French play\n\n  Thought: Let's consider the given choices carefully.\nIf three French novels are selected, we need to select at least one Russian novel to meet the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, option A, which includes only one Russian novel, is not feasible.\nOption B includes two French plays, which violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option B is not feasible.\nOption C includes one Russian novel and one Russian play. However, if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play cannot be selected, which contradicts the fact that we have selected one Russian play. Therefore, option C is not feasible.\nOption D includes one Russian novel and two French plays. This option meets all the requirements, as we have selected at least three novels, no more than four French works, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
