At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\n\n  Thought: \nThe bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf, so it cannot be empty. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and M must be on the bottom shelf, F must also be on the bottom shelf. G and H must also be on the bottom shelf because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. K must be placed on a higher shelf than F, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf. O must be placed on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, the only possible combination of books on the bottom shelf is G, H, L, and M.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
