Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\n\n  Thought: \nLet's break this down step by step:\n* The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so it's made on Tuesday.\n* The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\n* The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n* The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditions:\n* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, as the second batch is made on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\nThis is true, as we have established that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\nB: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\nThis is false, as we have established that only one batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.\n\nC: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\nThis is true, as the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.\n\nD: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\nThis is false, as we have established that only one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.\n\nE: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\nThis is true, as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
