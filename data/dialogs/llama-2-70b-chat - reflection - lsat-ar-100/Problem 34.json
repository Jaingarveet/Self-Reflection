        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\n\n  Thought: \nIf P is the only zoologist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one chemist. Let's consider the possible combinations:\n\n1. If F is selected as the botanist, then K cannot be selected as the chemist since K and M cannot both be selected. In this case, L must be selected as the chemist. But this violates the condition that if exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. Therefore, this combination is not possible.\n2. If G is selected as the botanist, then K can be selected as the chemist. But this violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, this combination is not possible.\n3. If H is selected as the botanist, then L must be selected as the chemist. In this case, M must be selected as the third scientist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. This satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination that satisfies all the conditions is H-L-M-P.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

I thought that if exactly one chemist was selected, it must be K, but that is not necessarily true.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of conditions\n* Incorrect application of logic\n\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the problem again, taking into account the correct conditions:\n\n1. If F is selected as the botanist, then K cannot be selected as the chemist since K and M cannot both be selected. In this case, L must be selected as the chemist. This combination satisfies all conditions.\n2. If G is selected as the botanist, then K can be selected as the chemist. This combination also satisfies all conditions.\n3. If H is selected as the botanist, then L must be selected as the chemist. In this case, M must be selected as the third scientist, and P must be selected as the zoologist.
