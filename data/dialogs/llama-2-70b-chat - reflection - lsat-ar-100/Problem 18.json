Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?\nChoices:\n  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle\n  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\n  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\n\n  Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThis question is a classic example of a \"scheduling problem\" often encountered in logic and law. We can use a methodical approach to determine the correct answer.\n\nFrom the given conditions, we know that:\n\n* Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.\n* Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.\n* If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nLet's analyze each choice:\n\nA: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle\nThis schedule violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nB: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\nThis schedule meets all the given conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday morning, and Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday morning and afternoon, respectively, which satisfies the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, this choice is correct.\n\nC: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\nThis schedule violates the condition that George can only give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nD: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\nThis schedule violates the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nE: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\nThis schedule violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
