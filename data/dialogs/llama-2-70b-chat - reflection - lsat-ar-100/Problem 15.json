Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\n\n  Thought: \nGiven that the shoe store is in space 4, we can start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row. One of the restaurants must be in space 7, so we'll place it there. The other restaurant must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we'll place it in space 3. The optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, so we'll place it in space 2. The veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy or the optometrist, so we'll place it in space 5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we'll place it in space 6.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA: False. The optometrist is next to the pharmacy, not a restaurant.\nB: False. The pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian.\nC: False. The restaurant is not next to the toy store.\nD: True. The shoe store is next to the toy store.\nE: False. The shoe store is not next to the veterinarian.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
