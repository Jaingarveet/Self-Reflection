Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\n\n  Thought: \nThe middle shelf must have at least two books. Since I is on the middle shelf, we can add that to any list. The top shelf has fewer books than the bottom shelf, so we must choose two books from the remaining seven to place on the top shelf. We can choose either F or K to go on the top shelf with G. If we choose F, then M must go on the bottom shelf with O, L, and K. In that case, the middle shelf would be I, L, and H. If we choose K, then L must go on the bottom shelf with O, F, and M. In that case, the middle shelf would be I and H.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider all possible combinations of books that could be placed on the shelves. I mistakenly assumed that the middle shelf must have at least two books, which led me to eliminate some possible combinations.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Overlooked possibility\n* Insufficient consideration\n* False assumption\n\nSolution:\nI will re-evaluate the problem and consider all possible combinations of books that could be placed on the shelves.\n\n1. G is placed on the top shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n6. The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. F, K, L, M, O on the bottom shelf.\n2. F, L, M, O, K on the bottom shelf.\n3. F, L, K, M, O on the bottom shelf.\n4. F, M, L, K, O on the bottom shelf.\n5. F, M, K, L, O on the bottom shelf.\n\nIn all possible combinations, the middle shelf can have either two or three books. The top shelf can have either G alone or G and F. The bottom shelf can have either F, L, M, O, and K or F, M, L, K, and O.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. List all possible combinations of books that can be placed on the shelves.\n2. Evaluate each combination to ensure that it meets all the given conditions.\n3. Identify the correct answer from the given choices.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always consider all possible combinations of facts and conditions.\n* Avoid making assumptions or overlooking possibilities.\n* Evaluate each possibility carefully and systematically.\n* Double-check your work to ensure accuracy."
