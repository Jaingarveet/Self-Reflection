Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n\n  Thought: \nGiven that Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, we can start by filling in the schedule with the given conditions:\n\n* Monday: Jackson\n* Tuesday: Hong and Garcia (since Garcia can't testify on Monday and Hong can't testify on Wednesday)\n* Wednesday: Iturbe\n\nNow, we can see that condition 1 (Franco doesn't testify on the same day as Garcia) is met since Franco doesn't testify on Tuesday.
