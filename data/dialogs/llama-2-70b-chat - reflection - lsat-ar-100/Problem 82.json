Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\n\n  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe question provides us with five conditions that must be met when matching the sales representatives to the sales zones. Let's break down each condition and see how they can be satisfied:\n\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice to see which one satisfies all the conditions:\n\nA: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\nThis choice violates condition 1, as both Parra and Tiao are assigned to Zone 1.\n\nB: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\nThis choice violates condition 2, as both Tiao and Udall are assigned to Zone 2.\n\nC: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\nThis choice satisfies all the conditions. Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1. Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work together in Zone 1. Stuckey and Udall work together in Zone 2. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nD: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\nThis choice violates condition 3, as Parra and Quinn are not working together in the same sales zone.\n\nE: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nThis choice violates condition 4, as Stuckey and Udall are not working together in the same sales zone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

After re-evaluating the question and the choices, I realized that the correct answer is indeed B.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nChoice B satisfies all the conditions:\n\n* Zone 1: Kim, Tiao (satisfies condition 1)\n* Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall (satisfies condition 2)\n* Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn (satisfies condition 3)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this answer is helpful."
