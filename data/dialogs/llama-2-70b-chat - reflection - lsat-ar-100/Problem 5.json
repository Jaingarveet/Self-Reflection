Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\n  Thought: \nThe given information can be summarized as follows:\n* F is on the same shelf as M.\n* I is on the middle shelf.\n* K is on a higher shelf than F.\n* O is on a higher shelf than L.\n\nFrom the conditions, we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the top shelf must have at most two books.\n\nWe also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf.\n\nSince O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf.\n\nNow, we can analyze the choices:\n\nA: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\nThis is false. Since F is on the same shelf as M, and O is on a higher shelf than F, O must be on a higher shelf than M.\n\nB: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\nThis is true. We know that K is on the top shelf, and G is not on the top shelf, so this condition must be true.\n\nC: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\nThis is false. Since I is on the middle shelf, and F is on the middle shelf, this condition must be false.\n\nD: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\nThis is false. We know that G is not on the top shelf, and O is on the top shelf, so this condition must be false.\n\nE: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nThis is true. Since F is on the middle shelf, and L is on the bottom shelf, this condition must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Specifically, I incorrectly assumed that F was on the middle shelf, and L was on the bottom shelf.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation of conditions\n* Incorrect assumption\n* Failure to consider all possible scenarios\n\nSolution:\nI should have carefully analyzed the conditions and considered all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions. Here's the correct solution:\n\n1. F is on the same shelf as M.\n2. I is on the middle shelf.\n3. K is on a higher shelf than F.\n4.
