Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim\n  B: Mahr\n  C: Stuckey\n  D: Tiao\n  E: Udall\n\n  Thought: \nQuinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, and Parra cannot work in Zone 1 if Tiao works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.\nThe only option that satisfies this condition is E: Udall, as Udall works in Zone 2, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
