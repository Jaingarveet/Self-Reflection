The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Landon\n  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Novetzke\n\n  Thought: \nThis is a classic case of a \"stable marriage\" problem, where we need to assign ambassadors to countries in a way that satisfies certain constraints. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nNow, let's consider the given choices:\n\nA: Jaramillo and Landon - This violates constraint 2, as Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned together.\nB: Jaramillo and Novetzke - This violates constraint 1, as both Kayne and Novetzke cannot be assigned to the same country.\nC: Kayne and Landon - This satisfies all constraints, as Kayne is assigned to Yemen, and Landon is assigned to Zambia.\nD: Kayne and Novetzke - This violates constraint 1, as both Kayne and Novetzke cannot be assigned to the same country.\nE: Landon and Novetzke - This violates constraint 4, as Landon must be assigned to Zambia.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
