Identify the type of argument presented (deductive, inductive, or abductive).\n2. Recognize that the argument is not purely deductive, as it involves probabilistic reasoning.\n3. Understand that the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it.\n4. Consider alternative scenarios or conditions that could affect the conclusion.\n5. Choose the answer that reflects the probabilistic nature of the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Be cautious when dealing with arguments and their conclusions. \n - Recognize the difference between deductive, inductive, and abductive arguments, and their implications for the relationship between premises and conclusions. \n - Understand that in probabilistic arguments, the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it. \n - Always consider alternative explanations or conditions that could impact the conclusion. \n - Practice analyzing arguments to improve your critical thinking and reasoning skills.\n"
