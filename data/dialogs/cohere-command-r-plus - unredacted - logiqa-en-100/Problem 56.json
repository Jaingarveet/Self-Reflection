        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.\nQuestion: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?\nChoices:\n  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\n  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\n  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I misinterpreted the task and selected the option that supported, rather than doubted, the expert's viewpoint. The correct answer, choice D, highlights that ships designed to adapt to the passage of the Yangtze River can already pass through, casting doubt on the necessity of the expert's proposed solution. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Inattention to detail\n- Overlooking context\n\nSolution: \nThe expert's viewpoint is that the bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to accommodate larger ships. \nChoice D suggests that ships can already be designed to adapt to the passage, implying that the bridge modification may not be necessary. This choice, therefore, raises the most doubts about the expert's viewpoint. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the task: identify the expert's viewpoint and look for the option that casts the most doubt on it. \n2. Analyze each choice: consider how it relates to the expert's viewpoint and whether it supports or contradicts it. \n3. Identify misinterpretations: ensure you correctly identify the option that creates the most doubt. \n4. Contextualize: consider the implications of each choice and how they might affect the need for the proposed solution. \n\nAdvice: \n- Carefully read and understand the context, the expert's viewpoint, and the task at hand. \n- Ensure you interpret the task correctly; look for options that cast doubt, not support the viewpoint. \n- Analyze each choice critically, considering its implications and how it relates to the broader context. \n- Avoid making assumptions or overlooking important details; focus on the specific arguments and evidence presented. \n- Always double-check your interpretation and selection before finalizing your answer.\n"
