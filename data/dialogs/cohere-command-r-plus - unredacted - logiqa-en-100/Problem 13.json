I focused on the mention of \"stupidity\" and selected an answer choice that emphasized individual blame, which is not the main point of the sentence. The correct answer, Choice C, highlights the systemic failure implied by the phrase \"morally disgusting and intellectually absurd.\" \n\nError Keywords:\n- Interpretation error\n- Misunderstanding context\n- Ignoring key phrases\n\nSolution: \nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nInstructions: \n1. Read the context and question carefully, noting any keywords or phrases that indicate the main point. \n2. Identify and interpret any figurative language or implied meanings. \n3. Analyze each answer choice critically, evaluating how well it aligns with the context and addresses the question. \n4. In this case, the phrase \"morally disgusting and intellectually absurd\" suggests a critique of a system that allows such a contradiction to exist, which is directly addressed in Choice C. \n5. Choice C offers a systemic perspective, suggesting a distribution system to ensure a decent life for all, which aligns with the implied criticism in the context. \n\nAdvice: \n - Always read the context and question carefully, paying attention to keywords and phrases that indicate the main point or argument. \n - Interpret any figurative language or implied meanings; don't take everything literally. \n - Analyze each answer choice critically, evaluating how well it captures the essence of the context and addresses the question. \n - Look for answers that address systemic issues rather than individual blame, especially when the context hints at structural failures or injustices. \n - Remember that logic questions often require identifying underlying assumptions or implications, so don't be swayed by superficial similarities in answer choices.\n"
