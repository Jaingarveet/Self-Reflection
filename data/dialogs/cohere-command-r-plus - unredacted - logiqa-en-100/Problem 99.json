        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Conne Levi with a \"moe\" look looks like other newborns.But because it is the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology, his advent has attracted the attention of experts and scholars.Not long ago, this news detonated the audience at the \"European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Annual Meeting\" held in London, England.And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\".\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people?\nChoices:\n  A: \"Artificial\" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective\n  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition\n  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for \"customized babies\", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused\n  D: \"Customized babies\" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the question and the context. I focused on the fact that \"customized babies\" had not been tried globally and ignored the part about \"eugenics and the concept of cloning.\" I missed the key distinction between gene screening for defect prevention and the concept of creating \"customized babies.\"\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Ignoring key details\n - Lack of attention to context\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is Choice C. Gene screening, as described in the context, is primarily about avoiding reproductive defects and creating opportunities for human eugenics. The concept of \"customized babies,\" on the other hand, involves cloning, which is a separate and more complex ethical issue. Choice C refutes the view that \"customized babies\" are imminent by clarifying the purpose and scope of gene screening technology. It distinguishes between gene screening for defect prevention and the concept of creating \"customized babies.\"\n\nInstructions:\n1. Focus on the specific argument to be refuted: the belief that \"humans may usher in the era of 'customized babies'.\"\n2. Examine each choice for its effectiveness in refuting this belief.\n3. Consider the context and the distinction between gene screening and \"customized babies.\"\n4. Identify the choice that clarifies this distinction and refutes the belief effectively.\n\nStep-by-step solution:\n1. The context mentions \"the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology.\" This refers to gene screening, which aims to avoid reproductive defects and create opportunities for human eugenics.\n2. Choice C clarifies that gene screening has a specific purpose and scope, distinct from the concept of \"customized babies.\" It refutes the belief by explaining that \"customized babies\" involve cloning, a separate and more complex ethical issue.\n3. Therefore, Choice C is the best option to refute the views of ordinary people who believe that \"customized babies\" are imminent.\n\nAdvice:\n - Read and understand the context carefully, paying attention to key distinctions and nuances.\n - Focus on the specific argument or belief to be refuted and identify the most effective counterargument.\n - Consider the scope and limitations of the technology described and how it differs from potential future applications.\n - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions based on limited information.\n - Always seek to clarify and distinguish between similar but distinct concepts.\n"

This choice clarifies the distinction between gene screening and the concept of \"customized babies.\" Gene screening, as described in the context, is primarily about avoiding reproductive defects and creating opportunities for human eugenics. It is not the same as \"customizing\" babies, which involves the complex ethical issue of cloning.\n\nChoice A discusses loopholes in artificial genetic screening, but it does not directly refute the belief that \"customized babies\" are imminent. Choice B talks about the potential for technology to outpace human cognition, which is a separate issue. Choice D mentions the lack of global trials and ethical challenges, but it does not address the core distinction between gene screening and \"customized babies.\"\n\nTherefore, Choice C is the best option as it effectively refutes the view that \"customized babies\" are imminent by clarifying the purpose and scope of gene screening technology.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
