The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nBased on these conditions, I can conclude that if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the following must be true:\n\nAction: I will select the correct answer, E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\n\nExplanation: Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the only possible days for batches to be made are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. Therefore, the number of batches made on Monday is less than the number of batches made on Tuesday."
