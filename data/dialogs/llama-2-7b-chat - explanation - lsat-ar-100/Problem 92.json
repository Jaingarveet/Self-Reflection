To solve this problem, I need to identify the sales representatives who work in each zone and the relationships between them.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nBased on the given conditions, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao. The statement \"Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2\" implies that Tiao works in Zone 2, and Quinn cannot work in the same zone as Tiao. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Tiao."
