The correct answer is (C) Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\nExplanation:\nIf the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses is replaced with the new constraint, the locations of the businesses will still satisfy all the constraints. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 5 or 7. The veterinarian must be in space 3 or 4, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 2, respectively. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it must be in space 2 or 4. The shoe store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 6. The optometrist must be in space 1, and the two businesses between the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it must be the shoe store and the toy store, so the shoe store must be in space 6 and the toy store must be in space 5. Therefore, the locations of the businesses will still satisfy all the constraints if the new constraint is used instead of the original constraint."
