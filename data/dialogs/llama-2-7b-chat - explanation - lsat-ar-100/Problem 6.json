Here's my reflection:\n\nI misunderstood the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. I thought that Kramer and Lopez reviewed the same number of plays, which led me to choose the wrong answer.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I realized that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so they must review different plays. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews, Jiang must review at least two plays.\n\nNow, I will answer the question again using the correct reasoning:\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n\nExplanation:\n\nFrom the given conditions, we know that:\n\n* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.\n* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nUsing these conditions, we can deduce that Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang does. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does."
