Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

Let me re-evaluate the possible combinations of lab assistants and session times:\n\n* Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, so Julio's session must meet on a different day than Kevin's.\n* Lan cannot lead an afternoon session, so Lan's session must meet on a different day than the afternoon session led by Nessa.\n* Olivia's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Nessa's session.\n\nAction: Based on the above reflection, the correct answer is (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n\nExplanation:\nOlivia's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Nessa's session, which means it must be on Thursday morning. Since Kevin and Julio both lead morning sessions, Julio's session must meet on a different day than Kevin's, which means it must be on Wednesday morning. Therefore, the only possible combination of lab assistants and session times is:\n\n* Julio leads Wednesday morning session.\n* Kevin leads Thursday morning session.\n* Lan leads Friday afternoon session.\n* Nessa leads Friday morning session.\n* Olivia leads Thursday morning session.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) Olivia's session meets Thursday morning."
