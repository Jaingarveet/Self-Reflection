This is represented as 0.8 * original price.\nThen, an 8 percent sales tax is added to this discounted price, so the total price Alma paid is 108 percent of the discounted price. This is represented as 1.08 * discounted price.\nSo, the total price Alma paid, $p$, is equal to 1.08 * 0.8 * original price.\nTo find the original price in terms of $p$, we need to divide $p$ by 1.08 * 0.8.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
