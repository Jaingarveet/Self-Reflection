If the width is decreased by p%, it becomes (1 - p/100) times the original width. The new area is then 1.1*(1 - p/100) times the original area. \nGiven that the new area is 12% less than the original area, we have:\n1.1*(1 - p/100) = 0.88\nSolving this equation for p gives us the percentage decrease in the width.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
