Here, I will use the elimination method.\nThe system of equations is:\n3x + 4y = -23\n2y - x = -19\nFirst, I will multiply the second equation by 3 to make the coefficients of x the same in both equations:\n6y - 3x = -57\nNow, I can add the two equations together:\n3x + 4y + (-3x) + 6y = -23 + (-57)\n10y = -80\nDividing both sides by 10 gives:\ny = -8\nSubstituting y = -8 into the second equation gives:\n2*(-8) - x = -19\n-16 - x = -19\nx = 16 - 19 = -3\nSo, the solution to the system of equations is (-3, -8).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
