From the table, the difference between consecutive y-values is 3 (1 - -2 = 3, 4 - 1 = 3, 7 - 4 = 3). This means the coefficient of n in the function should be 3. So, the function should be of the form f(n) = 3n + c. To find c, we can substitute one of the given points into the function. Let's use the point (1, -2). Substituting these values into the function gives -2 = 3*1 + c. Solving for c gives c = -5. So, the function is f(n) = 3n - 5.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
