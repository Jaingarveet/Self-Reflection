The slope m = (-a - 0) / (3a - a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.\nThe y-intercept is the y-value when x = 0. From the table, we can see that there is no x = 0, so we need to extrapolate. If we continue the pattern in the table, we can see that when x = 0, y = a.\nSo, the equation of the line is y = -1/2x + a. \nWe can rearrange this to the form of the answer choices: 2x + y = 2a.\nAction: None of the above options match the correct equation."
