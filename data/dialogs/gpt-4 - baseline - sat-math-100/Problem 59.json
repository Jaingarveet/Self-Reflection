He estimated there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter the first year the grains were deposited, with a $1 \\%$ annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter thereafter. Which of the following functions models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited?\nChoices:\n  A: $P(t)=310^{t}$\n  B: $P(t)=310^{1.01 t}$\n  C: $P(t)=310(0.99)^{t}$\n  D: $P(t)=310(1.01)^{t}$\n"

This is modeled by the formula P(t) = P0 * (1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial amount, r is the rate of increase, and t is the time. Here, P0 = 310, r = 1% = 0.01, and t is the number of years. So, the correct model is P(t) = 310 * (1 + 0.01)^t = 310 * (1.01)^t.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
