According to the problem, x = 1.5y. \nSince the sum of all three numbers is 855, we can write the equation as x + y = 855.\nSubstituting x = 1.5y into the equation, we get 1.5y + y = 855, which simplifies to 2.5y = 855.\nSolving for y, we get y = 342.\nSubstituting y = 342 into the equation x = 1.5y, we get x = 1.5 * 342 = 513.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
