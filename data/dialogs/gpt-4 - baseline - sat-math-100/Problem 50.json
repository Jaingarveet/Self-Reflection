There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female? (Note: Assume that none of the eighth-grade students are both right-handed and left-handed.)\nChoices:\n  A: 0.410\n  B: 0.357\n  C: 0.333\n  D: 0.250\n"

Then, the number of right-handed female students is 5x. \nSimilarly, let's denote the number of left-handed male students as y. Then, the number of right-handed male students is 9y. \nFrom the problem, we know that the total number of left-handed students is 18, so x + y = 18. \nWe also know that the total number of right-handed students is 122, so 5x + 9y = 122. \nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. \nFrom the first equation, we can express y as 18 - x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 5x + 9(18 - x) = 122. Simplifying this equation, we get 5x + 162 - 9x = 122, which simplifies to -4x = -40. Solving for x, we get x = 10. \nSubstituting x = 10 into the first equation, we get 10 + y = 18, so y = 8. \nSo, there are 10 left-handed female students and 8 left-handed male students. This means there are 50 right-handed female students and 72 right-handed male students. \nThe probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is the number of right-handed female students divided by the total number of right-handed students, which is 50 / 122 = 0.410.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
