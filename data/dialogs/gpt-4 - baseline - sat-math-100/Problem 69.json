Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. \nSince his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon, he should drive 1.25 * 25 = 31.25 miles less each week. \nSo, the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week is 25/4 * m = 5, where m is the number of gallons less he should use each week.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
