A low standard deviation means that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.\nWithout calculating the exact standard deviations, we can see that the values in List B are more spread out from the mean than the values in List A. Therefore, the standard deviations are different.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
