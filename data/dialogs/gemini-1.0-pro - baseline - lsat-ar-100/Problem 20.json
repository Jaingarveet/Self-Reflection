Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\n"
