Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target\n  B: Image's voicemail target\n  C: Solide's website target\n  D: Truvest's voicemail target\n  E: Truvest's website target\n"

This means that Solide's website target must be even shorter than 2 days (since it must be shorter than Truvest's website target). Therefore, option C (Solide's website target) cannot be 2 days.\nSimilarly, Image's voicemail target must be shorter than Solide's voicemail target (which is already shorter than Truvest's website target). This means that Image's website target must be even shorter than 2 days. Therefore, option A (Image's website target) cannot be 2 days.\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n* B: Image's voicemail target: This could be 2 days, as it is not restricted by the conditions.\n* D: Truvest's voicemail target: This could be 2 days, as it is not restricted by the conditions.\n* E: Truvest's website target: This cannot be 2 days, as it must be longer than Solide's website target (which is already shorter than 2 days).\nTherefore, the only options that could be 2 days are Image's voicemail target (option B) and Truvest's voicemail target (option D).\nAction: Answer(\"B\") or Answer(\"D\") \n"
