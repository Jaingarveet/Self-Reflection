Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: J is second.\n  B: J is third\n  C: Q is first.\n  D: Q is third\n  E: R is seventh.\n"

Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic: This means we cannot have two finance articles or two nutrition articles edited consecutively.\n2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third: This implies that either S is before Q and Q is third, or S and Q are not consecutive.\n3. S must be earlier than Y: This means S must be edited before Y.\n4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R: This implies that J, G, and R must be edited in that order.\nNow, let's consider the options:\nA: J is second: This could be true if J is followed by a non-finance article (e.g., S or Y).\nB: J is third: This could be true if J is followed by Q (which would be the third finance article).\nC: Q is first: This could be true if Q is followed by a non-finance article (e.g., S or Y).\nD: Q is third: This is not possible because S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third, and we already established that S must be earlier than Y.\nE: R is seventh: This could be true if R is preceded by two non-finance articles (e.g., S and Y).\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
