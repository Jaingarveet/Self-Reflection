Grain > Livestock > Textiles: This means Grain is in a higher numbered bay than Livestock, which is in a higher numbered bay than Textiles.\n2. Produce > Fuel: Produce is in a higher numbered bay than Fuel.\n3. Textiles is next to Produce: This means they are in adjacent bays.\nNow, let's consider each option:\nA. Grain: Grain could be in bay 5 or 6, satisfying the conditions.\nB. Livestock: Livestock could be in bay 3 or 4, satisfying the conditions.\nC. Machinery: The information provided doesn't restrict the position of Machinery.\nD. Produce: Produce could be in bay 2 or 3, satisfying the conditions.\nE. Textiles: Textiles cannot be in bay 4 because it needs to be next to Produce, which cannot be in bay 4 due to the Produce > Fuel condition.\nTherefore, the cargo that CANNOT be in bay 4 is Textiles.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
