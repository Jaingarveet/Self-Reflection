This is not necessarily true. O could be on the middle shelf with I, while M and F are on the bottom shelf.\n- B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on. This is not necessarily true. K could be on the middle shelf with I, while G and F are on the bottom shelf.\n- E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on. This is not necessarily true. F could be on the bottom shelf with M, while L is on the middle shelf with I.\nNow, let's consider options C and D:\n- C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on. This is true. Since I is on the middle shelf and F is on the bottom shelf, I is on a higher shelf than F.\n- D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on. This is not necessarily true. G could be on the middle shelf with I, while O is on the top shelf.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
