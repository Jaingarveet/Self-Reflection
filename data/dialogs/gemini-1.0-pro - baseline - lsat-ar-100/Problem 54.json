This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\nC: Megregian reviews Sunset. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\nD: Megregian reviews Tamerlane. This cannot be true because Megregian does not review any play Jiang reviews, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane.\nE: O'Neill reviews Undulation. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is that Megregian does not review Tamerlane.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
