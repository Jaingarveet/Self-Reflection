Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.\n  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.\n  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.\n"

This could be true. Image's website target could be 1 day and Solide's website target could be 3 days, fulfilling all conditions.\nB: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's. This could also be true. Solide's website target could be 1 day and Image's website target could be 3 days, satisfying all conditions.\nC: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's. This cannot be true. If Solide's voicemail target is shorter, then Image's voicemail target would also be shorter, contradicting the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients'.\nD: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's. This could be true. Truvest's website target could be 1 day and Image's website target could be 3 days, adhering to all conditions.\nE: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's. This cannot be true. If Truvest's voicemail target is shorter, then Image's voicemail target would also be shorter, contradicting the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients'.\nTherefore, options A, B, and D could be true, while options C and E cannot be true.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
