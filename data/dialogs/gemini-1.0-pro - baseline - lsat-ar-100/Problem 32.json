Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\n"
