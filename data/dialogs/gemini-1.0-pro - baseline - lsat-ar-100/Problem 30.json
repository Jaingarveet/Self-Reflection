Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\n"

This means the fourth solo must also be traditional (otherwise, the third and fourth wouldn't be consecutive).\n* Since the fourth solo is traditional, and Wayne must play a modern piece before the third (traditional) solo, Wayne cannot play the fourth solo. Therefore, Zara must play the fourth solo.\n* As the first and fifth solos are by the same pianist, and the fourth solo is by Zara, Wayne must play the first and fifth solos.\n**Therefore, the following must be true:**\n* **A: Zara performs the first solo.** (This follows from the deduction that Wayne plays the first and fifth solos.)\n* **B: Wayne performs the third solo.** (This follows from the information that the third solo is traditional and Wayne plays a modern piece before it.)\n* **C: Zara performs the fifth solo.** (This follows from the deduction that Wayne plays the first and fifth solos.)\n* **D: The second solo is a traditional piece.** (This follows from the information that the third and fourth solos are both traditional.)\n* **E: The fourth solo is a modern piece.** (This is not necessarily true. The fourth solo could be either modern or traditional, depending on whether Wayne or Zara plays it.)\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only statement that must be true is **A: Zara performs the first solo.** \n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
