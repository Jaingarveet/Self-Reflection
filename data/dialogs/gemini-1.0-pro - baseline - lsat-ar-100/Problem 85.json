Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: In the order in which the articles are edited, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: first\n  B: third\n  C: fourth\n  D: fifth\n  E: sixth\n"

This satisfies all conditions.\n* B: third: S could be edited third, preceded by two finance articles (H and J), then Q, R, and Y. This satisfies all conditions.\n* C: fourth: S could be edited fourth, preceded by three finance articles (G, H, and J), then Q, R, and Y. This satisfies all conditions.\n* D: fifth: S could be edited fifth, preceded by four finance articles (G, H, J, and R), then Q and Y. This satisfies all conditions.\n* E: sixth: S cannot be edited sixth because it must be edited before Y. If S were sixth, Y would have to be seventh, violating the condition that S must be earlier than Y.\nTherefore, the only position where S cannot be edited is sixth.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
