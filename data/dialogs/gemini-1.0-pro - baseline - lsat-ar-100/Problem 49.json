Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n"

Restaurants separated by at least 2 businesses:\n    - This means there must be at least 1 business between them, and they cannot be adjacent.\n3. Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian:\n    - This leaves 2 options for the pharmacy's placement.\n4. Toy store not next to veterinarian:\n    - This further restricts the placement options.\nLet's test the answer choices:\nA: Pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n    - Pharmacy is at one end, restaurant at the other.\n    - Restaurants are separated by 2 businesses (shoe store and veterinarian).\n    - Pharmacy is next to the optometrist.\n    - Toy store is not next to the veterinarian.\n    - This satisfies all constraints.\nB: Pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n    - Pharmacy is at one end, restaurant at the other.\n    - Restaurants are separated by 3 businesses (optometrist, shoe store, and toy store).\n    - Pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n    - Toy store is not next to the veterinarian.\n    - This also satisfies all constraints.\nC: Restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n    - Pharmacy is not at an end.\n    - This violates the first constraint.\nD: Restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n    - Pharmacy is not at an end.\n    - This violates the first constraint.\nE: Restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n    - Pharmacy is not at an end.\n    - This violates the first constraint.\nTherefore, both A and B could be the order of the businesses.\nAction: Answer(\"A or B\")"
