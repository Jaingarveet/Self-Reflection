O'Neill could review Sunset and Tamerlane, while Jiang, Kramer, and Lopez review Undulation.\nC: Jiang reviews Undulation.\nThis is not possible.

If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill would be the only two students reviewing the same play, contradicting the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nE: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nThis is possible.
