The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\n"
