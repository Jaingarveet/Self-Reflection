The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the bay holding livestock?\nChoices:\n  A: bay 1\n  B: bay 2\n  C: bay 3\n  D: bay 5\n  E: bay 6\n"

Livestock could be in bay 2, followed by Textiles in bay 3, and then Produce in bay 4.\n* **C: bay 3:** This cannot be correct because Livestock needs to be higher than Textiles, which cannot be in bay 2 due to its proximity to Produce.\n* **D: bay 5:** This is not possible because Grain needs to be higher than Livestock, and there is no space for Grain above bay 5.\n* **E: bay 6:** This cannot be correct because Livestock needs to be lower than Grain, which cannot be in bay 5 due to the information about Produce and Fuel.\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
