The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is second\n  B: H is second.\n  C: S is second\n  D: R is third.\n  E: Y is third\n"

This violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, as G is finance and the first article could also be finance.\nB: H is second. This satisfies all conditions. H is finance, so it can follow a nutrition article. S can be before or after Q, and Y can be after S.\nC: S is second. This violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y.\nD: R is third. This satisfies all conditions. R is finance, so it can follow a nutrition article. S can be before Q, and Y can be after S.\nE: Y is third. This violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
