This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nB: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nC: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.

This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nE: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does. This MUST be true. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two students review the same plays, O'Neill must review at least one more play than Kramer.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
