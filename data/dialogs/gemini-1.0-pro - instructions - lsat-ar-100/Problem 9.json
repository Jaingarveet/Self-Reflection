Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

Specifically, I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\nTo answer this question correctly, I will need to consider all of the rules and then use a process of elimination to determine which of the answer choices is possible.\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n1. Consider the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. This means that Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n2. Consider the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means that Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n3. Consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This means that Young cannot be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n4. Consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means that Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n5. Use a process of elimination to determine which of the answer choices is possible.\n   - Choice A is not possible because Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1.\n   - Choice B is not possible because Young cannot be assigned parking space #2.\n   - Choice C is possible.\n   - Choice D is not possible because Souza cannot be assigned parking space #3.\n   - Choice E is possible.\nTherefore, the only answer choice that is possible is C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
