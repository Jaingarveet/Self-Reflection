Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

This violated the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n**Learning from the mistake:**\n* It is crucial to pay close attention to **all** the rules and constraints, not just some of them.\n* Carefully analyze each option and compare it to **all** the rules to ensure that no rule is violated.\n* Double-check the reasoning and analysis before selecting the final answer.\n## Applying the learnings to the current question:\n**Analyzing the options:**\n* **Option A:** This option violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n* **Option B:** This option violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n* **Option C:** This option violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n* **Option D:** This option satisfies all the rules. Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n* **Option E:** This option violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n**Therefore, the correct answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu**\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")**"
