I assumed that because no batch of cookies was made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies must be made on Tuesday. However, this is not necessarily true. It is possible that only two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and the third batch is made on Friday.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions and then use logic to determine which of the answer choices must be true.\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n1. Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.\n2. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.\n3. Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, then either two or three batches of cookies are made on Monday.\n4. If two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then the third batch of cookies must be made on Friday.\n5. If three batches of cookies are made on Monday, then the third batch of cookies cannot be made on Friday.\nTherefore, the only answer choice that must be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
