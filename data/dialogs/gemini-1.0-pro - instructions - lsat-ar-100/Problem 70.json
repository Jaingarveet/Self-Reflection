Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target\n  B: Image's voicemail target\n  C: Solide's website target\n  D: Truvest's voicemail target\n  E: Truvest's website target\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

However, this information does not guarantee that Image's website target would be 2 days.\n* **Correct Answer:** The correct answer is **C: Solide's website target**.\n**Explanation:**\n* Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n* Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 2 days, as it would be longer than Truvest's website target.\n* Image's website target cannot be 2 days, as it would be longer than Image's voicemail target.\n* Truvest's voicemail target cannot be 2 days, as it would be longer than Solide's voicemail target.\n* Therefore, the only remaining option is **C: Solide's website target**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")"
