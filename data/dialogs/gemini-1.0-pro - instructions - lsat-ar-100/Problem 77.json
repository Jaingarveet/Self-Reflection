I initially assigned Robertson parking space #1, Souza parking space #2, Togowa parking space #3, Young parking space #4, Xu parking space #5, and Vaughn parking space #6. However, this assignment violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\nTo correct my mistake, I need to reassign the parking spaces so that Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. One possible solution is to assign Robertson parking space #2, Souza parking space #1, Togowa parking space #3, Young parking space #4, Xu parking space #5, and Vaughn parking space #6. This assignment satisfies all of the rules.\nNow, let's consider the question of how many of the six new employees have their parking space assignment limited to only two possible spaces.\n* Robertson: Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n* Souza: Souza can be assigned any of the remaining five parking spaces.\n* Togowa: Togowa can be assigned any of the remaining four parking spaces.\n* Young: Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson.\n* Xu: Xu must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson.\n* Vaughn: Vaughn can be assigned any of the remaining three parking spaces.\nTherefore, the assignment of a parking space is limited to only two possible spaces for two of the six new employees: Robertson and Young.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
