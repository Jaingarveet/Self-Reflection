        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?\nChoices:\n  A: a 1-day website target\n  B: a 2-day voicemail target\n  C: a 2-day website target\n  D: a 3-day voicemail target\n  E: a 3-day website target\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and conditions carefully.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n3. Consider all aspects of the problem, not just a subset.\n4. Eliminate choices that are clearly incorrect.\n5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.\n6. Double-check your reasoning and answer.\n"
