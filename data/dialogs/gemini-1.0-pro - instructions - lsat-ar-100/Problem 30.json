Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

I focused on the condition that the third solo is a traditional piece and the condition that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively, but I did not consider the condition that the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. As a result, I did not realize that the pianist who performs the first solo cannot also perform the second solo.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions and use a process of elimination.\nProcess of elimination:\n* Condition 1: The third solo is a traditional piece.\n* Condition 2: Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\n* Condition 3: In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.\n* Condition 4: The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.\n* Condition 5: No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nLet's consider each answer choice:\n* A: Zara performs the first solo. This is possible, but it does not necessarily have to be true.\n* B: Wayne performs the third solo. This is possible, but it does not necessarily have to be true.\n* C: Zara performs the fifth solo. This is possible, but it does not necessarily have to be true.\n* D: The second solo is a traditional piece. This is not possible because the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, and the fifth solo is a traditional piece.\n* E: The fourth solo is a modem piece. This is possible, but it does not necessarily have to be true.\nTherefore, the only answer choice that must be true is A: Zara performs the first solo.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
