I prematurely eliminated options without thorough analysis.\n## Analysis of the constraints:\n1. **Pharmacy and Restaurant at opposite ends:** This leaves 5 spaces for the remaining 5 businesses.\n2. **Restaurants separated by at least 2 businesses:** This means there can be either 2 or 3 businesses between the restaurants.\n3. **Pharmacy next to Optometrist or Veterinarian:** This leaves 4 spaces for the remaining 4 businesses.\n4. **Toy store not next to Veterinarian:** This further restricts the placement of the toy store.\n## Identifying valid arrangements:\n**Case 1: 2 businesses between restaurants:**\n- Pharmacy, Optometrist, Veterinarian, Toy store, Restaurant, Shoe store, Restaurant\n- Pharmacy, Veterinarian, Optometrist, Toy store, Restaurant, Shoe store, Restaurant\n**Case 2: 3 businesses between restaurants:**\n- Pharmacy, Optometrist, Shoe store, Toy store, Restaurant, Veterinarian, Restaurant\n- Pharmacy, Veterinarian, Shoe store, Toy store, Restaurant, Optometrist, Restaurant\n## Analyzing the answer choices:\n- **A:** This arrangement satisfies the constraints and falls under Case 1.\n- **B:** This arrangement satisfies the constraints and falls under Case 1.\n- **C:** This arrangement violates the constraint of restaurants being at opposite ends.\n- **D:** This arrangement violates the constraint of restaurants being separated by at least 2 businesses.\n- **E:** This arrangement violates the constraint of the pharmacy being next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n## Conclusion:\nBoth options A and B are valid arrangements that satisfy all the constraints.
