I assumed that since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, then Quinn must also work in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Udall. However, this is not necessarily true. It is possible that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, while Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3. In this case, Quinn would not be working in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Udall.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to carefully consider all of the conditions that are given and then use a process of elimination to determine which of the answer choices is the only one that is consistent with all of the conditions.\nThought:\nQuinn and Parra work in the same sales zone.\nStuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.\nThere are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nIf Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Udall, then there would be four sales representatives working in Zone 3 and only two sales representatives working in Zone 2. This would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nTherefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
