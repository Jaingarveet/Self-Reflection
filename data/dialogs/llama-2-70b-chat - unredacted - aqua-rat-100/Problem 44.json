How many men are required to complete same work in 1/2 day.\nChoices:\n  A: 93 men\n  B: 94 men\n  C: 95 men\n  D: 96 men\n  E: 97 men\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation.\nI incorrectly calculated the number of men required to complete the work in one day.\nI divided 8 by 6 instead of dividing 8 by 12 to find the number of men required to complete the work in half a day.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Division error\n- Rounding error\n\nSolution:\n8 men work for 6 days to complete a work.\n1 day = 24 hours\n1/2 day = 12 hours\n\nNumber of men required to complete the work in 1 day = 8 men / 6 days = 8/6 = 1 1/3 men\n\nNumber of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day = 1 1/3 men / 2 = 11/2 = 5 1/2 men\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a man, we round up to the nearest whole number.\nTherefore, 6 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the number of men required to complete the work in 1 day.\n2. Divide the number of men by 2 to find the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day.\n3. Round up the result to the nearest whole number.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Be careful when rounding numbers to ensure you round up to the nearest whole number.\n"
