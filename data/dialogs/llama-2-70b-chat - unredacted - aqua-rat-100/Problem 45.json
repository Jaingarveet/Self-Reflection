I misunderstood the question and calculated the profit incorrectly.\nThe correct calculation is as follows:\n1. The cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.\n2. The seller, Karan, wants to make a 20% profit.\n3. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 20% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.\n4. 20% of the cost price is:\n1200 x 0.20 = 240\n5. The selling price should be:\n1200 + 240 = 1440\n6. However, the question states that Karan wants to offer a 20% discount, not make a 20% profit.\n7. Therefore, the selling price should be:\n1440 - (20% of 1440) = 1440 - 288 = 1152\n\nSo, the correct answer is choice E: 1,800.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Miscalculation\n* Misunderstanding of the question\n* Confusion between profit and discount\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the cost price of the sewing machine.\n3. Calculate 20% of the cost price.\n4. Add the calculated percentage to the cost price to find the selling price.\n5. Check if the question asks for a profit or a discount.\n6. If the question asks for a discount, subtract the discount amount from the selling price.\n7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated selling price.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that profit and discount are different concepts, and they require different calculations.\n"
