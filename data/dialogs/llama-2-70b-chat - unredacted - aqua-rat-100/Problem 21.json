We want to find the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.\n\nWe can set up a proportion using the rates:\nx/x = y/y\nx2/x2 = y2/y2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days is:\n\nx2/y2\n\nSo, the correct answer is B: y3/x2 units.\n\nNote: In this problem, we are not asked to find the ratio of work done by x men to work done by y men, but rather the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days. This is an important distinction, as it requires us to take into account the time factor in the problem."
