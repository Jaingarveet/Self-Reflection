Determine the volume of the rectangular solid:\nVolume = Length × Width × Height\nVolume = 3 × 4 × 15\nVolume = 60\n\n2. Set up the equation to solve for the radius of the sphere:\nSince the solid is inscribed in a sphere, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the solid.\nWe can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:\nV = (4/3)πr³\n\nwhere r is the radius of the sphere.\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n(4/3)πr³ = 60\n\n3. Solve for the radius of the sphere:\nr³ = (60/(4/3)) = 3^3 = 27\nr = 3\n\n4. Find the diameter of the sphere:\ndiameter = 2r = 2(3) = 6\n\n5.
