        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\nChoices:\n  A: 7\n  B: 8\n  C: 10\n  D: 11\n  E: 12\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the information given in the question and calculated the time taken by Mr. Black to paint 3 houses incorrectly.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the question\n* Calculation error\n* Incorrect application of information\n\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 6 = 18 days.\n2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, so he has painted 3 houses in 8 days.\n3. Mr. Black starts working after 8 days, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 days to paint 3 houses.\n4. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 8 = 24 days.\n5. Since Mr. Black has 10 days to paint 3 houses, he will finish in 10 days.\n6. Mr. Blue will finish the contract in 12 - 10 = 2 days.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the information given.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller steps.\n3. Calculate the time taken by each person to paint a house.\n4. Calculate the total time taken by Mr. Brown to paint 3 houses.\n5. Calculate the time taken by Mr. Black to paint 3 houses.\n6. Calculate the time taken by Mr. Blue to complete the contract.\n7. Choose the correct answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the information given.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Consider all the given information and use it appropriately.\n* Don't assume or misunderstand the information given in the question.\n"
