What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?\nChoices:\n  A: 1%\n  B: 2%\n  C: 5%\n  D: 9%\n  E: 10%\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed incorrectly.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Misunderstanding the question\n- Confusion between percentages\nSolution:\nLet's first find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored.\n10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so 90% are vanilla flavored.\nNow, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed.\n90% of the rest (which means 90% - 10% = 80%) are squashed.\nSo, the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed is 20%.\nNow, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.\nTo do this, we multiply the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored (90%) by the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed (20%).\n90% x 20% = 18%.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the percentage of chocolates that are cocoa flavored.\n2. Identify the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored.\n3. Identify the percentage of chocolates that are squashed.\n4. Identify the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed.\n5. Multiply the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored by the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that percentages can be confusing, so it's important to be careful when calculating with them.\n"
