If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?\nChoices:\n  A: 8.5\n  B: 10.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 14.5\n  E: 16.5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and solved for the wrong variable. I was trying to find the number of grams of health food that would provide 100% of the daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A, instead of finding the number of grams that would provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question\n* Solving for the wrong variable\n* Not paying attention to the units of measurement\n\nSolution:\nLet X be the number of grams of health food to be eaten daily.\n\nSince 1 gram of health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, X grams will contain 9% of X grams = 0.09X\n\nSimilarly, since 1 gram of health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, X grams will contain 8% of X grams = 0.08X\n\nTo meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need 0.09X >= 100% and 0.08X >= 100%.\n\nSolving the system of inequalities, we get:\n\n0.09X >= 100%\n0.08X >= 100%\n\nX >= 11.11\n\nSince the answer is rounded to the nearest integer, we have:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") 12.5\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the variables involved.\n2. Identify the correct variables to solve for.\n3. Pay attention to the units of measurement.\n4. Solve the system of equations or inequalities accordingly.\n5. Round the answer to the nearest integer if necessary.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the variables involved.\n* Identify the correct variables to solve for.\n* Pay attention to the units of measurement.\n* Solve the system of equations or inequalities accordingly.\n* Round the answer to the nearest integer if necessary.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n"
