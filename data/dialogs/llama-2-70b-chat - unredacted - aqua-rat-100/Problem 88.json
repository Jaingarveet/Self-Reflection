After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\nChoices:\n  A: 10\n  B: 11.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 13.5\n  E: 15\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation of the total journey duration.\nI incorrectly calculated the time taken to cover the remaining distance, and therefore, the total time.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Time and distance error\n- Speed error\nSolution:\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The train's original speed is 100 miles/hour, and it takes 10 hours to reach its destination.\n2. This means the train travels a total distance of 1000 miles (10 x 100).\n3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which is 250 miles (1/4 x 1000).\n4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles (1000 - 250) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75\nTime = 10\n\n5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance:\n\nTotal Time = 10 + 10\nTotal Time = 20\n\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 12.5 hours.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the total distance traveled by the train.\n2. Identify the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance.\n3. Identify the time taken to cover the remaining distance.\n4. Calculate the total journey duration by adding the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that speed, distance, and time are interrelated, and a mistake in one can affect the others.\n"

The time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance is 10 hours.\n3. The time taken to cover the remaining distance is 10 hours.\n4. The total journey duration is 20 hours.\n5. Double-checking, we can calculate the total distance traveled by the train:\n\nTotal Distance = Distance traveled at 100 miles/hour + Distance traveled at 75 miles/hour\nTotal Distance = 1000 - 250 + 750\nTotal Distance = 1000 + 750\nTotal Distance = 1750\n\n6.
