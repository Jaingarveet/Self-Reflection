If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?\nChoices:\n  A: 80°\n  B: 130°\n  C: 140°\n  D: 160°\n  E: 220°\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that B bisects minor arc AC, but I incorrectly concluded that the measure of minor arc AD is 80°.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Reasoning error\n* Misapplication of concept\n* Incorrect conclusion\n\nSolution:\nPoints A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc BD is half of 160°, which is 80°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 160° - 80° = 130°.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the fact that B bisects minor arc AC.\n2. Recognize that the measure of minor arc BD is half of 160°.\n3. Calculate the measure of minor arc AD by subtracting the measure of minor arc BD from 160°.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated measure of minor arc AD.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully analyze the given information and identify the relevant facts.\n* Apply the concepts and formulas appropriately.\n* Double-check your calculations and conclusions.\n* Consider all the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options.\n* Practice similar problems to improve your problem-solving skills.\n"
