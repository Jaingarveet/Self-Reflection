What will be the measure of each side?\nChoices:\n  A: 9\n  B: 11\n  C: 22\n  D: 25\n  E: 31\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the area of the square instead of the length of each side.\nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding the question\n- Calculation error\n- Area instead of length\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle:\nLength = 27 cm\nBreadth = 17 cm\n\nThe wire is bent to form a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square \"s\".\n\nWe know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the length of the wire.\nPerimeter of the square = s + s + s + s\n= 4s\n\nWe also know that the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length plus the breadth.\nPerimeter of the rectangle = Length + Breadth\n= 27 + 17\n= 44\n\nSince the wire is bent to form a square, the perimeter of the square must be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.\n4s = 44\n\nNow, we can solve for \"s\":\ns = 11\n\nSo, the length of each side of the square is 11 cm.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle.\n2. Calculate the perimeter of the square.\n3. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.\n4. Equate the perimeter of the square to the perimeter of the rectangle.\n5. Solve for the length of each side of the square.\n6. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Be careful when calculating perimeters and areas.\n- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n- Use the correct formula for the problem at hand.\n- Plug your answer back into the original equation to ensure it makes sense.\n"
