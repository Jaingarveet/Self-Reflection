If both trains just left the station simultaneously, how long until they do so again?\nChoices:\n  A: 272 minutes\n  B: 304 minutes\n  C: 190 minutes\n  D: 70 minutes\n  E: 35 minutes\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of least common multiple (LCM). I thought that the LCM of 16 and 17 was 112, when in fact it is 272. This led me to calculate the wrong time for when both trains would leave simultaneously again.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of least common multiple (LCM)\n* Calculation error\n\nSolution:\nTrain A leaves every 16 minutes, so it will leave at 16, 32, 48, 64, ... minutes past the hour.\nTrain B leaves every 17 minutes, so it will leave at 17, 34, 51, 68, ... minutes past the hour.\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 is 272.\nTherefore, both trains will leave simultaneously again in 272 minutes.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the time interval at which Train A leaves the station.\n2. Identify the time interval at which Train B leaves the station.\n3. Determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the two time intervals.\n4. Calculate the time at which both trains will leave simultaneously again by multiplying the LCM by the number of minutes past the hour.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and double-check your understanding of mathematical concepts before applying them to problems.\n* Be careful when calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, as it can be easy to make mistakes.\n* Take your time when solving problems and avoid rushing through calculations.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that the least common multiple (LCM) is the product of the two numbers, not the sum.\n"
