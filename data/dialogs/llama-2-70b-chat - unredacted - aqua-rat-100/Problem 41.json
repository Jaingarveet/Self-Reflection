As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was\nChoices:\n  A: 8\n  B: 12\n  C: 16\n  D: 24\n  E: 25\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and thought that the number of friends who attended the picnic was x - 4, instead of x.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question\n* Calculation error\n* incorrect variables\n\nSolution:\nLet's assume the number of friends who attended the picnic is x.\nThe total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.\nSince four friends did not turn up, the amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 / x.\nSince each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the total amount spent by them is Rs. 96 / x + 4x.\nWe want to find the value of x for which the above expression is equal to Rs. 96.\n\nRs. 96 / x + 4x = Rs. 96\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 8.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the variables.\n2. Use the correct variables in your calculation.\n3. Simplify your calculation before solving for the answer.\n4. Check your answer to ensure it is reasonable.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the variables.\n* Always use the correct variables in your calculation.\n* Always simplify your calculation before solving for the answer.\n* Always check your answer to ensure it is reasonable.\n* Practice solving similar problems to improve your math skills.\n"
