His monthly income is ?\nChoices:\n  A: Rs. 4400\n  B: Rs. 4270\n  C: Rs. 4000\n  D: Rs. 3937.50\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the percentage given in the question and calculated 12 1/2% of X instead of 12 1/2% of the man's income.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Percentage error\n* Calculation error\n* Misunderstanding of the question\n\nSolution:\nLet X be the monthly income of the man.\n\nWe know that he spends Rs. 3500 per month, so his savings are:\nS = X - 3500\n\nWe are also given that he saves 12 1/2% of his income, so:\nS = 0.125X\n\nNow, we can set up the equation:\n0.125X - 3500 = 12 1/2% of X\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n0.125X = 4000\n\nDividing both sides by 0.125, we get:\nX = 32,000\n\nSo, the man's monthly income is Rs. 32,000.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Let X be the monthly income of the man.\n2. Calculate his savings using the formula: S = X - 3500.\n3. Calculate the percentage of his income that he saves using the formula: S = 0.125X.\n4. Set up an equation using the two formulas.\n5. Simplify the equation to find X.\n6. Calculate the man's monthly income using X.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* When working with percentages, be careful to calculate the correct percentage of the correct value.\n"
