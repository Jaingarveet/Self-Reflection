Calculate the numerator correctly.\n2. Calculate the denominator correctly.\n3. Simplify the fraction.\n4. Compare the result to the given choices.\n5. Choose the matching answer.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always double-check your calculations.\n- Be careful when multiplying numbers.\n- Take your time when solving problems.\n- Use a calculator to check your calculations.\n- Review basic arithmetic operations.\n"
