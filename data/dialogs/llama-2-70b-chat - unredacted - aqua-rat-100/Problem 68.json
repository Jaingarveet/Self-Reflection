If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\nChoices:\n  A: 242\n  B: 308\n  C: 352\n  D: 412\n  E: 456\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.\nI correctly identified the GCF and LCM of 350 and 7700, but I made a mistake in factoring 7700 to find the other integer.\nI mistakenly factored 7700 as 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7, when in reality, it can also be factored as 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7.\nThis mistake led me to choose 308 as the other integer, when in reality, it should have been 242.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Factoring mistake\n* Incorrect calculation\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Determine the prime factorization of 350: 350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7\n2. Determine the prime factorization of 7700: 7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7\n3. Identify the common prime factors between 350 and 7700: 2, 5, and 7\n4. Determine the GCF of 350 and 7700: GCF = 2 x 5 x 7 = 11\n5. Determine the LCM of 350 and 7700: LCM = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 = 7700\n6. Find the other integer by factoring 7700: 7700 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7\n\nThe other integer is 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 242.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the GCF and LCM of the two given integers.\n2. Factor the LCM to find the other integer.\n3. Check your calculation by verifying that the product of the two integers is equal to the LCM.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Make sure to consider all possible factorizations of a number before making a conclusion.\n* Use a systematic approach to factoring, such as factoring by prime factors or common factors.\n* Take your time and work carefully through each step of the problem.\n"
