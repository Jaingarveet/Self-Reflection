I simplified the expression for x as follows:\nx = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)\nx = 2(n + 2)2 / (n + 2)2\nx = 2\n\nHowever, this simplification is not correct. The correct simplification is:\nx = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)\nx = 2(n2 + 4n + 8) / (n2 + 4n + 4)\nx = 2(n + 2) / (n + 2)\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, the range of x is indeed 20 < x < 54, which matches choice A.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Simplification error\n- Calculation error\n- Numerator and denominator cancelation error\n\nSolution:\nIowa State University is located in the city of Ames\nIowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.\nThe city name \"Ames\" contains 4 letters.\nThe state name \"Iowa\" contains 4 letters.\nThe product of 4*4 is 16.\nInstructions:\n1.
