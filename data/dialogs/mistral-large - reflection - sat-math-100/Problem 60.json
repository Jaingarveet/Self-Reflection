If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\n\nThought:\nLet's denote the number of students in the class as x.\n\nWhen Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 3x + 5.\n\nWhen Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional 21 milliliters. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 4x + 21.\n\nSince the total amount of solution distributed is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equation:\n\n3x + 5 = 4x + 21 - 21\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x + 5 = 4x - 21 + 21\n\n3x + 5 = 4x\n\nSubtracting 3x from both sides, we get:\n\n5 = x\n\nHowever, this answer is not one of the available choices.
