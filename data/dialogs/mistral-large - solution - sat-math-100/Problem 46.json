The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?\nChoices:\n  A: Mean\n  B: Median\n  C: Range\n  D: They will all change by the same amount.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe mean is the average of the data set, and it is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the sum of the values, and therefore decrease the mean.\nThe median is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in order. Since there are 21 values, the median is the 11th value. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median, since it is not the 11th value.\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the range, since it is the largest value.\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED], because removing the outlier will have the greatest impact on the range.\n"

Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the sum of the values, and therefore decrease the mean. However, since there are 21 values in the data set, the effect of removing one value will not be as significant as the effect on the range.\n\nThe median is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in order. Since there are 21 values, the median is the 11th value. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median, since it is not the 11th value.\n\nThe range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.
