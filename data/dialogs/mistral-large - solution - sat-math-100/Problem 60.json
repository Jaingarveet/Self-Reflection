If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's denote the number of students in the class as x.\nWhen Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 3x + 5.\nWhen Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional [REDACTED] milliliters. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 4x + [REDACTED].\nSince the total amount of solution distributed is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equation:\n3x + 5 = 4x - [REDACTED]\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n3x + 5 + [REDACTED] = 4x - [REDACTED] + [REDACTED]\n3x + [REDACTED] = 4x\nSubtracting 3x from both sides, we get:\n[REDACTED] = x\nHowever, this answer is not one of the available choices. This means that there must be a mistake in the question or the choices provided.\n"
