        "content": "Thought:\nThe original price of the computer can be found by first finding the discounted price before tax, and then finding the original price before the discount.\nThe discounted price before tax is 8% less than the discounted price after tax, so it is 92% of the discounted price after tax.\nThe discounted price after tax is the total amount paid, $p$.\nSo the discounted price before tax is $0.92p$.\nThe original price before the discount is 20% more than the discounted price before tax, so it is 120% of the discounted price before tax.\nSo the original price before the discount is $1.2(0.92p) = (1.2)(0.92)p = (0.8)(1.08)^{-1}p$.\nTo isolate $p$, we can multiply both sides by $(0.8)(1.08)$, giving us $p = (0.8)(1.08)(0.8)(1.08)^{-1}p = (0.8)(1.08)p$.\nTherefore, the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ is $\\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
