        "content": "  My previous answer was incorrect, and after reflecting on the problem, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculations. The correct answer is [REDACTED].\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to first find the area of the semi-circles. The formula for the area of a semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. The radius of the semi-circle is half the length of the side of the square, which is 20 cm/2 = 10 cm.\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the remaining paper after the semi-circles are cut out. The area of the remaining paper is equal to the area of the square minus the area of the two semi-circles.\n\nThe area of the square is (side length)^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.\n\nThe area of the two semi-circles is (1/2)π(10)^2 = 50π cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 50π = 350π cm^2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 350π.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
