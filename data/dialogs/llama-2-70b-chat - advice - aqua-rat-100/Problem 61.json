        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the distance traveled during this part of the trip is:\nDistance = Time x Speed\nDistance = (3 hours) x 70 mph\nDistance = 210 miles\n2. Since Kevin turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled during both parts of the trip:\nTotal Distance = Distance from A to B + Distance from B to A\nTotal Distance = 210 miles + (3 hours) x 90 mph\nTotal Distance = 210 miles + 270 miles\nTotal Distance = 480 miles\n3. We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that the distance traveled during the second part of the trip (from B to A) is equal to the total distance traveled minus the distance traveled during the first part of the trip (from A to B):\nDistance from B to A = Total Distance - Distance from A to B\nDistance from B to A = 480 miles - 210 miles\nDistance from B to A = 270 miles\n4. Since the distance from B to A is equal to the distance from A to B, we can set up the equation:\nDistance from A to B = Distance from B to A\n210 miles = 270 miles\n5. Solving for the distance from A to B, we get:\nDistance from A to B = 210 miles / 2\nDistance from A to B = 105 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is 105 miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
