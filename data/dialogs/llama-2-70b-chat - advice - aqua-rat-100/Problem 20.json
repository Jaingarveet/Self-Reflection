We can solve for B using the first equation:\nB = 4G/3\nNow, substitute the expression for B into the second equation:\n4G/3 - G = 0\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n4G - 3G = 0\nG = 0\nThis means that the number of girls is zero, which is not possible.\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice B, 288.\n\nIn this case, I made a mistake in setting up the equation and simplifying it.
