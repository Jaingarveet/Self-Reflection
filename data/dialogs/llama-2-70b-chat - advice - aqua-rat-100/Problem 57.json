I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, and I cannot reflect on past answers or actions. However, I can provide general information on how to approach this type of problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to use the formula for the distance traveled by an object rotating around a circle:\n\nDistance = (2πr) / 100\n\nWhere r is the radius of the circle and is given as 10 centimeters.\n\nFirst, convert 30 seconds to minutes:\n\n30 seconds = 0.5 minutes\n\nThen, convert 300 revolutions per minute to revolutions per second:\n\n300 revolutions/minute = 5 revolutions/second\n\nNow, calculate the distance traveled in 0.5 minutes:\n\nDistance = (2πr) / 100 = (2π(10)) / 100 = 20π / 100 = 200π\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
