Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. 24% of all Daifu students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n2. 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club.\n\nWe need to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.\n\nLet X be the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that 24% of all Daifu students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. So, we can write:\n\n0.24 = (X + 0.20)\n\nNow, we need to solve for X. We can do this by subtracting 0.20 from both sides of the equation:\n\n0.24 - 0.20 = X + 0.20 - 0.20\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0.04 = X\n\nSo, X = 0.04 or 4%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 4%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
