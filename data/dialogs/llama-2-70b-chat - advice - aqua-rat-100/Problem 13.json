I mistakenly added 7 and 18 instead of finding 7/18 of the number.\n\nGiven that the student found the value of 7/18 of a number instead of 7/8, we can set up the equation:\n\n7/18 of X = (7/8)X - 770\n\nWe can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 18:\n\n7X/18 = (7/8)X - 770\n\nWe can now solve for X by multiplying both sides by 18:\n\n7X = 18((7/8)X - 770)\n\nWe can simplify the equation further by combining like terms:\n\n7X = 18(7/8)X - 18(770)\n\nWe can simplify the equation further by simplifying the fraction:\n\n7X = 18(7/8)X - 13660\n\nWe can now solve for X by subtracting 18(7/8)X from both sides:\n\n7X - 18(7/8)X = -13660\n\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 7:\n\nX - 18(7/8)X/7 = -13660/7\n\nWe can simplify the equation further by simplifying the fraction:\n\nX - 2X = -1952\n\nWe can solve for X by subtracting 2X from both sides:\n\n-X = -1952\n\nWe can divide both sides by -1 to get:\n\nX = 1952\n\nTherefore, the number that the student should have found is 1952.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
