The correct answer is (C) 620.\n\nHere's my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:\n\nThe formula for calculating the amount owed after n years with a simple interest rate of p per annum is:\nA = P(1 + p)^n\n\nWhere:\nA = amount owed after n years\nP = principal amount borrowed\np = simple interest rate per annum\nn = time in years\n\nIn this case, the principal amount borrowed is Rs. 500, the simple interest rate is 6% per annum, and the time is 4 years.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nA = 500(1 + 0.06)^4\nA = 500(1.06)^4\nA = 500(1.264)\nA = 620\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 620.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
