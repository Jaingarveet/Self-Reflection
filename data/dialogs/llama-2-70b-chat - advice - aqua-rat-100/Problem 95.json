John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk twice.\n\nAfter the first replacement, the concentration of tea is:\n50% - (15% of 50%) = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%\n\nAfter the second replacement, the concentration of tea is:\n42.5% - (15% of 42.5%) = 42.5% - 6.375% = 36.125%\n\n2. Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.\n\nThe concentration of tea after this step is:\n36.125% - (10% of 36.125%) = 36.125% - 3.6125% = 32.51%\n\nThe final concentration of tea John drinks is 32.51%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
