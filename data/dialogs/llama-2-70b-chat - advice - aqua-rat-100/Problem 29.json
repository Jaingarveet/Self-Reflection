Let's try again.\nThe frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down each day, so the frog's net movement upward is 3 - 2 = 1m per day.\nThe frog starts at the bottom of the well, which is 30m deep.\nTo find the number of days it will take for the frog to come out of the well, we can divide the depth of the well by the frog's net movement upward.\n30m / 1m per day = 30 days\nAction: Answer(\"E\") 29 days"
