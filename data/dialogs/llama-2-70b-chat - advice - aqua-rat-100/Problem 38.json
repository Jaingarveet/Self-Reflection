        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, which means it has a length, width, and height of 5cm.\n2. The thickness of the cube is 1cm, so the inner cube has a size of 5cm - 1cm = 4cm.\n3. The inner cube is made up of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so the number of smaller cubes in the inner cube is 4cm x 4cm x 4cm = 64 cubes.\n4. Since the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted, all the faces of the outer cube are painted.\n5. The number of faces of the outer cube is 6.\n6. The number of faces of each smaller cube is also 6.\n7. Since all the faces of the outer cube are painted, the number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes is 64 x 6 = 384.\n8. Therefore, the answer is 384, which corresponds to choice E: 498.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
