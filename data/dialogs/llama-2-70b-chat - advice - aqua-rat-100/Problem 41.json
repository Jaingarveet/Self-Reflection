I misunderstood the question and used the wrong variables.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n* A group of friends planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables.\n* Four of them did not turn up.\n* The remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.\n\nWe need to find out the number of friends who attended the picnic.\n\nLet's call the number of friends who attended the picnic \"x\".\n\nWe know that the total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.\n\nSo, the amount spent per person was Rs. 96/x.\n\nSince four friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is reduced by 4.\n\nLet's call the reduced number of friends \"y\".\n\nWe know that y = x - 4.\n\nThe amount spent per person, including the extra Rs. 4, is Rs. (96/y) + 4.\n\nSince the total amount spent on eatables is Rs. 96, we can set up the equation:\n\nRs. (96/y) + 4 = Rs. 96\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n96/y + 4 = 96\n\nSubtracting 4 from both sides:\n\n96/y = 92\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = 96/92\n\ny = 11\n\nSo, there were 11 friends who attended the picnic.\n\nNow, let's check our answer:\n\nThe answer is C: 16.\n\nThis is incorrect. The correct answer is B: 12.\n\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I divided 96 by 11 instead of 12.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\n96/12 = 8\n\nSo, there were 8 friends who attended the picnic.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
