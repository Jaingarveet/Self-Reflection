The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED].\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need to find five consecutive two-digit odd numbers and check if their sum divided by 10 is a perfect square.\n\nThe five consecutive two-digit odd numbers are:\n47, 49, 51, 53, 55\n\nThe sum of these numbers is:\n47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 245\n\nWhen divided by 10, 245 is not a perfect square. Therefore, none of the given choices can be one of the five numbers.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") None of the above."
