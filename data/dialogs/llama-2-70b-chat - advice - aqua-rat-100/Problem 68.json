I incorrectly found the greatest common factor of 350 and 7700, which led to the wrong answer.\n\nLet's reflect on the problem:\nThe greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\n\nI will start by factoring 350:\n350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7\n\nNow, I will factor 7700:\n7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7\n\nThe greatest common factor of 350 and 7700 is indeed 11, as previously stated.\n\nNow, let's find the other integer:\nWe know that 350 and the other integer have an LCM of 7700. Therefore, the other integer must be a multiple of 7700/350 = 22.\n\nThe only choice that is a multiple of 22 is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
