Let's reflect on the problem:\nSuppose you want to arrange your English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science books on a shelf. In how many ways can you do it?\nThe first book can be any one of the six books.\nThe second book can be any one of the remaining five books.\nThe third book can be any one of the remaining four books.\nThe fourth book can be any one of the remaining three books.\nThe fifth book can be any one of the remaining two books.\nThe sixth book is the last book, and it can be placed in only one way.\nNow, let's calculate the number of ways to arrange the books:\nThe first book can be placed in 6 ways.\nThe second book can be placed in 5 ways.\nThe third book can be placed in 4 ways.\nThe fourth book can be placed in 3 ways.\nThe fifth book can be placed in 2 ways.\nThe sixth book can be placed in 1 way.\nHence, by the multiplication principle, the total number of ways to arrange the books is:\n6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 720.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
