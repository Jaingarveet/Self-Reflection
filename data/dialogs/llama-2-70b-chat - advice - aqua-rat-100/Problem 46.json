I misunderstood the problem and calculated the wrong percentage.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The man spends Rs. 3500 per month.\n2. He saves 12 1/2% of his income.\n\nTo find his monthly income, we need to calculate the amount he saves first:\n\n12 1/2% of his income = 0.125 x income\n\nNow, we know that he saves Rs. 3500 per month, so:\n\n0.125 x income = 3500\n\nNow, dividing both sides by 0.125:\n\nIncome = 3500 / 0.125\n\nIncome = 28,000\n\nNow, we have found his monthly income, which is Rs. 28,000.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
