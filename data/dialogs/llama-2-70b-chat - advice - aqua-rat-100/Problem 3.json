If the area of each of the triangles is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?\n\nChoices:\n  A: 56\n  B: 58\n  C: 60\n  D: 62\n  E: 64\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly.\nI realized that I made a mistake in my calculation.\nI misunderstood the problem and calculated the perimeter of the rectangular piece instead of the original square piece.\nI also realized that I didn't check my answer to ensure it was reasonable and made sense in the context of the problem.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nLet's call the side length of the original square piece \"s\".\nThe area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangular piece is 70/2 = 350 square feet.\nThe perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(s - 4) + 2s = 4s - 8 + 2s = 6s - 8.\nSince the original piece was a square, its perimeter is equal to the side length squared, so s^2 = 6s - 8.\nSolving for s, we get s = 8.\nTherefore, the perimeter of the original piece of square cloth was 8^2 = 64 feet.\n\nThe correct answer is choice E: 64.\n\nI hope this answer is correct, and I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake."
