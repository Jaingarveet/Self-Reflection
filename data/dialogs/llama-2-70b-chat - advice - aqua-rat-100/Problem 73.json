I didn't consider the fact that the number of students who took physics and math together should be a subset of the total number of students in the school.\n\nLet's analyze the problem again:\nWe know that 20% of the students took physics, which means that 80% did not take physics.\nWe also know that 28% of the students took math, which means that 72% did not take math.\nWe can assume that there are x students in the school.\n\nWe can calculate the number of students who took physics as 20% of x: 0.2x.\nWe can calculate the number of students who took math as 28% of x: 0.28x.\n\nSince some students took both physics and math, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 0.2x and 0.28x.\nThe LCM of 0.2x and 0.28x is 0.056x.\n\nNow, we need to find the least possible value of x that satisfies the condition that 0.056x is an integer.\nWe can start by trying the smallest possible values of x: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nWe can see that 0.056x is an integer when x = 5.\n\nTherefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 500 (since we cannot have a fraction of a student).\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
