I misunderstood the problem and didn't read it carefully.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The man's rate in still water is 4 kmph.\n2. The man's rate against the current is 2 kmph.\n3. To find the man's rate along the current, we need to subtract the rate against the current from the rate in still water.\n\nSo, the man's rate along the current is:\n4 kmph - 2 kmph = 2 kmph\n\nThe correct answer is B: 6 kmph.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
