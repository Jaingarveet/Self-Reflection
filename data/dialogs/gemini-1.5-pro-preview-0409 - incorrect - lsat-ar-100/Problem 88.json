We still have flexibility on the placement of F, K, O, L which doesn't lead to a definitive arrangement.\n* **B: K and G are on the same shelf:** This doesn't give us enough information to determine the exact placement of all books. \n* **C: L and F are on the same shelf:** Since F and M are together, this would mean L, F, and M are on the same shelf.  Knowing O is above L, we still have multiple possibilities for arrangement.\n* **D: M and H are on the same shelf:** This would place H on the same shelf as F and M due to the given condition. We still have flexibility with K, O, and L.\n* **E: H and O are on the same shelf:** This would mean O and H are either both on the top or both on the bottom shelf. \n    * If they are on top, then the bottom shelf must have L, F, M (due to the given conditions) and the middle shelf would have I and K. This satisfies all conditions.\n    * If H and O are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf can only have K, leaving no space for L which must be below O. This violates a condition.\nTherefore, only option E leads to a single definitive arrangement of the books. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
