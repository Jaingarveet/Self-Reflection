The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

So, this is not necessarily true.\n* **B**: If L is selected, F *could* still be selected as there's no restriction between them. So, this is not necessarily true.\n* **C**: If only one chemist is selected, it doesn't have to be K. It could be L or M depending on other selections. So, this is not necessarily true.\n* **D**: If exactly two chemists are selected, F *could* still be selected as long as K and M are not both chosen. So, this is not necessarily true.\n* **E**: If exactly two chemists are selected, and P is the only zoologist, then there must be two botanists to fulfill the condition of having at least one scientist of each type. This means G *cannot* be selected because if it were, then there would be three botanists, which would violate the condition of selecting at most one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
