Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

This means either solos 2 & 3 or solos 3 & 4 are traditional. \nWe also know a traditional piece isn't played until Wayne plays a modern piece, so Wayne cannot play solo 2 or 3.\nIf Wayne plays solo 4 (traditional), then Zara plays solo 5 (modern) due to the consecutive traditional pieces rule and the pianist of solo 2 not playing solo 5 rule. This scenario satisfies all conditions with Wayne playing only one traditional piece.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
