Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

This would contradict Zone 3 having the most people. So, A is not possible.\n*   B: Similar to A, if Mahr is in Zone 2, then Zone 2 would have at least 2 people, contradicting the given information. So, B is not possible.\n*   C: If Parra is in Zone 3, then Quinn is also in Zone 3. This leaves only one possibility for Zone 1 (either Tiao or Udall). This would mean Zone 3 has more people than Zone 1, contradicting the information given. So, C is not possible.\n*   D: If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra cannot be in Zone 1. This means Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3. Udall must then be in Zone 2 with Stuckey. This scenario satisfies all conditions: Zone 1 has 2 (Tiao and one of Kim/Mahr), Zone 2 has 2 (Udall and Stuckey), and Zone 3 has 3 (Parra, Quinn, and one of Kim/Mahr). \n*   E: If Udall is in Zone 3, then Stuckey is also in Zone 3. This leaves only one possibility for Zone 2 (either Tiao or Parra). This would mean Zone 3 has more people than Zone 2, but it doesn't guarantee that Zone 1 has more people than Zone 3. So, E is not necessarily true. \nTherefore, the only option that could be true is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
