Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.

Has 3 Himalayans with no repeats and not on day 7. We need to check for Rottweilers.\n* **C:** Starts with Manx, possible. Has 3 Himalayans with no repeats and not on day 7. We need to check for Rottweilers.\n* **D and E:** Start with Siamese, possible. But both have Himalayans on day 7, which is not allowed.\nNow, let's check options B and C for Rottweiler placement considering they cannot be with Himalayans:\n* **B:** The only possible placement for Rottweilers without violating any rules is on days 1 and 4. This would mean Greyhounds are on day 4, violating the given condition. So, B is not possible.\n* **C:** Rottweilers can be placed on days 1 and 4 without conflict. \nTherefore, option C is the only one that satisfies all conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
