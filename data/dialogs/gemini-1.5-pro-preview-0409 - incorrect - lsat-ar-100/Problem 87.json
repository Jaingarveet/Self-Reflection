We still need at least 2 more to reach the minimum of 5. We can add:\n*   **1 Russian play:** This doesn't affect any conditions.\n*   **1 French play or 1 Russian novel:**  Either option works without violating any conditions.\nTherefore, the organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian play to satisfy all conditions while minimizing the total number of works. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
