The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.\n  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

The constraint \"If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne\" doesn't provide definitive information since Kayne is already assigned. The constraint \"If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen\" is irrelevant as Kayne is already assigned to Yemen. The last constraint \"If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia\" doesn't provide definitive information about the current scenario.
