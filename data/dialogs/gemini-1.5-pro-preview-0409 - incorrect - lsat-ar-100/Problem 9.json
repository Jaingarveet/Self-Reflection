Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

So, this is not possible.\n*   B: If Young is in #2, then Robertson must be in #1 (to satisfy the \"first four\" rule). This allows space for Souza and Togowa to be in lower-numbered spots than Young, satisfying the condition. \n*   C: If Robertson is in #3, then Young must be in #1 or #2. This would force Souza into #6 (as Xu also needs a higher number than Souza), leaving no space for Togowa to have a lower number than Young. So, this is not possible.\n*   D: If Souza is in #3, then Young must be in #4, #5, or #6. This leaves no space for Robertson to be in a higher-numbered spot within the first four. So, this is not possible.\n*   E: Knowing Vaughn's position doesn't give us enough information about the others. \nTherefore, the only option that allows Young to have a higher-numbered space than Souza while satisfying all conditions is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
