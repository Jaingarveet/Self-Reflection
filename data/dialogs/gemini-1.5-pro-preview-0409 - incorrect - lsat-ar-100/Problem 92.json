They also cannot be in Zone 2 because then Zone 3 wouldn't have more representatives. So, Quinn and Parra must be in Zone 3. This means Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall is in Zone 2, and Stuckey is with Udall in Zone 2. This leaves Kim and Mahr for Zone 3 with Quinn and Parra.\nTherefore, Quinn can work with Kim, Mahr, Parra, or Udall, but **not with Tiao**.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
