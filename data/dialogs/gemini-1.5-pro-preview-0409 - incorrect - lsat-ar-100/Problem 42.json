If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

It has one from each category (G-botanist, K-chemist, R-zoologist), so it fulfills the requirements.\nOption D includes M, so it requires both P and R to be selected, which it does. It also has one from each category (H-botanist, M-chemist, P and R - zoologists), fulfilling the requirements.\nTherefore, both options C and D are valid. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
