Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\n\nThought: \nFrom the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. \nSince either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, Tiao cannot work in the same zone as Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, or Udall. \nTherefore, Tiao must work in Zone 3. \nSince there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least three sales representatives. \nSo, the only possible answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

I assumed that Tiao must work in Zone 3, which led me to the wrong answer. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nFrom the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. \nSince either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Tiao can work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, but not in both. \nSince Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they cannot be in Zone 3 as Tiao cannot be with them. \nTherefore, the only sales representatives left to work in Zone 3 are Kim and Mahr. \nSo, the correct answer is A: Kim, Mahr.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.\n2. Identify the restrictions for each sales representative.\n3. Determine the possible zones for each sales representative based on the conditions.\n4. Eliminate the zones that cannot be assigned to each sales representative.\n5. Identify the sales representatives that can work in Zone 3.\n6.
