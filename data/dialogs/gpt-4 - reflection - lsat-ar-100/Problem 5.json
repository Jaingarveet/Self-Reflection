Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\nThought: \nFrom the conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, and O is higher than L. F and M are on the same shelf. Since K is higher than F, and F is with M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the middle or top shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf can have at most 3 books. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf because if they were on the top shelf, K would have to be on the middle shelf, and there would be 4 books on the top shelf, which is not allowed. Therefore, I must be on a shelf higher than F.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
