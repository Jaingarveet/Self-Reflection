        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\n\nThought: \nAccording to the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. \nLooking at the choices, only choice B satisfies all these conditions. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. In my chosen answer, Robertson was assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which contradicts the rules.\nError Keywords:\n- Overlooking information\n- Misinterpretation of rules\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Additionally, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. \nLooking at the choices again, only choice E satisfies all these conditions. In choice E, Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Also, Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is within the range specified.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and rules carefully.\n2. Understand the conditions that must be met for each employee.\n3. Review each choice and check if it satisfies all the conditions.\n4. Be careful not to overlook any rules or conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that meets all the conditions.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and rules carefully.\n- Break down the problem into smaller parts and tackle each part individually.\n- Be careful not to overlook any information.\n- Double-check your answer against the rules to ensure it meets all the conditions."
