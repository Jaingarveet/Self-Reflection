Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\n\nThought: \nIf M is the only chemist selected, then according to the conditions, both P and R must be selected. This means that two zoologists are selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. This rules out options A, B, and D which involve selecting more than one botanist. Option E is also ruled out because it involves selecting all three zoologists, which is not necessary. Therefore, the only option left is C: H and P are both selected. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that only two zoologists could be selected if M was chosen. However, the condition states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, but it does not limit the selection to only P and R. Therefore, Q can also be selected, which makes option E the correct answer.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of conditions\n- Incorrect assumption\n- Logical error\nSolution:\nIf M is the only chemist selected, then according to the conditions, both P and R must be selected. This means that at least two zoologists are selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. However, the condition does not limit the selection to only P and R, so Q can also be selected. Therefore, the correct answer is E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions of the problem.\n2. Identify the implications of each condition.\n3. Apply the conditions to the given situation.\n4. Evaluate each option based on the conditions and the given situation.\n5. Choose the option that must be true based on the conditions and the given situation.\nAdvice:\n- Always read and understand the conditions of the problem.\n- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n- Evaluate each option carefully.\n- Remember that the question asks for what must be true, not what could be true."
