The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either\nChoices:\n  A: first or second\n  B: second or third\n  C: fourth or sixth\n  D: fourth or seventh\n  E: sixth or seventh\n\nThought: \nGiven that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and O is performed immediately after T, then T cannot be performed immediately before F because O would have to be performed immediately after F, which is not possible. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R. This means that F must be performed after O and T. Since O is performed either first or fifth, and T is performed immediately after O, then F must be performed either third or seventh.
