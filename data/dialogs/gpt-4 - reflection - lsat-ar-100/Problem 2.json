        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?\nChoices:\n  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.\n  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\n  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.\n\nThought: \nThe original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants. \nLooking at the choices, only choice C: \"Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants\" ensures that there are at least two businesses between the two restaurants, which is the same effect as the original constraint.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the original constraint and its implications on the arrangement of the businesses. I focused on the separation of the restaurants, but I didn't consider the impact of the pharmacy's location, which is also a crucial part of the problem.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Constraint understanding error\nSolution:\nThe original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means that the restaurant nearest to the pharmacy can't be more than two spaces away from it. Therefore, the correct answer is D: \"No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\"\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the original constraints of the problem.\n2. Consider the implications of each constraint on the arrangement of the businesses.\n3. Understand the question and what it's asking for.\n4. Evaluate each choice based on the original constraints and the question.\n5. Choose the answer that best fits the original constraints and the question.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and constraints carefully.\n- Understand the implications of each constraint.\n- Consider all aspects of the problem, not just the ones that seem most obvious.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n- Don't rush your answer, take your time to understand the problem fully."
