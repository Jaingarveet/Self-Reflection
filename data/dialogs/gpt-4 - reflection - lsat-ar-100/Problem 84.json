Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\n\nThought: \nThe conditions state that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, meaning there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, options A and B can be eliminated. \nThe conditions also state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option C can be eliminated. \nThe conditions also state that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I assumed that this meant there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf, which led me to incorrectly eliminate options A and B.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Condition misunderstanding\n- Incorrect elimination\nSolution:\nThe conditions state that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, meaning there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. However, this does not mean that there cannot be two books on the bottom shelf if there is only one book on the top shelf. Therefore, options A and B should not be eliminated based on this condition.\nThe conditions also state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option C can be eliminated. \nThe conditions also state that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option D can be eliminated. \nThis leaves options A, B, and E as possible answers. However, option E can be eliminated because it includes four books, and there are only three shelves, with at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the question.\n2. Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n3. Eliminate options that do not meet the conditions.\n4. Consider all possible arrangements of books on the shelves.\n5. Choose the option that meets all the conditions and is a possible arrangement of books on the shelves.\nAdvice:\n- Always read and understand the conditions given in the question.\n- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n- Work systematically to eliminate options that do not meet the conditions.\n- Consider all possible arrangements to find the correct answer.\n- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your reasoning before choosing an answer."
