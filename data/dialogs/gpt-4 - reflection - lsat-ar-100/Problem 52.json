Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n\nThought: \nGiven that Iturbe and Jackson are both testifying on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one day, Monday, for the remaining three witnesses: Franco, Garcia, and Hong. Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, the only two left for Monday are Franco and Garcia. Therefore, exactly two witnesses must testify on Monday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. I focused on the condition that Hong cannot testify on Monday and concluded that Franco and Garcia must both testify on Monday. However, I failed to consider the restriction on Franco and Garcia.\nError Keywords:\n- Overlooking conditions\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Scheduling problem\nSolution:\nGiven that Iturbe and Jackson are both testifying on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one day, Monday, for the remaining three witnesses: Franco, Garcia, and Hong. Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, either Franco or Garcia must testify on Monday, but not both, because they cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, exactly one witness must testify on Monday.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.\n2. Identify the day each witness is scheduled to testify.\n3. Consider the restrictions on when each witness can testify.\n4. Determine the number of witnesses that can testify on each day based on the conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that must be true based on your analysis.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.\n- Always consider all conditions in the problem.\n- Always think through each condition step-by-step.\n- Never skip any conditions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n- Remember that in scheduling problems, the conditions often restrict the possible arrangements."
