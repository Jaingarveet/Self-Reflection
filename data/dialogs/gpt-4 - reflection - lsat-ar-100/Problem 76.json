Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be false?\nChoices:\n  A: The bay holding fuel is next to the bay holding machinery.\n  B: The bay holding grain is next to the bay holding machinery.\n  C: The bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel.\n  D: The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.\n  E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.\n\nThought: \nThe bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means that the bay holding textiles cannot be next to the bay holding fuel if the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding fuel must be at a lower number than the bay holding textiles.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the sequence of the bays. I assumed that the bay holding textiles could not be next to the bay holding fuel, but the question asked which statement must be false, not which could be false. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Sequence error\n- Logic error\nSolution:\nGiven the conditions, the bay holding grain must be at a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock must be at a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce must be at a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding textiles must be next to the bay holding produce. \nGiven these conditions, the bay holding livestock cannot be next to the bay holding fuel because the bay holding produce (which must be at a higher number than the bay holding fuel) is next to the bay holding textiles (which must be at a lower number than the bay holding livestock). Therefore, the statement that must be false is \"The bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel.\"\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the sequence of the bays based on the conditions given.\n2. Identify the relationships between the different types of cargo.\n3. Determine which statements could be true based on these relationships.\n4. Identify the statement that must be false based on these relationships.\n5. Choose the answer that matches this statement.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Understand the relationships between different elements in a problem.\n- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the information given.\n- Remember that a statement that could be false is not necessarily the statement that must be false."
