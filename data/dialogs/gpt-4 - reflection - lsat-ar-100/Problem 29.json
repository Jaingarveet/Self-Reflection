Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nThought: \nGiven that L is placed on a shelf higher than H, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf with O. \nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that K must be on the top shelf with O. I overlooked the possibility that K could be on the middle shelf, and F and M could be on the bottom shelf. This led me to the wrong conclusion.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Problem-solving error\nSolution:\nGiven that L is placed on a shelf higher than H, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. However, K could be on the middle shelf, and F and M could be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, H must be on the bottom shelf with F and M, making the correct answer C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions and constraints of the problem.\n2. Identify the relationships between the books and their placement on the shelves.\n3. Use logical reasoning to determine the possible placements of each book.\n4. Consider all possible scenarios, not just the most obvious ones.\n5. Identify the answer that must be true based on all possible scenarios.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always consider all possible scenarios, not just the most obvious ones.\n- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.\n- Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the information given.\n- Always double-check your answer to ensure it meets all conditions and constraints."
