Specifically, I mistakenly assumed that Li and Liu were hired by the same unit, which led me to eliminate option A. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that the information only states that Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, and it does not necessarily imply that Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer could be option A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.\n\nAlternatively, option B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji, could also be a possible answer. If Liu and Zhao were hired by Tianji, and Li was hired by Tianshu, then Wang would be the only one left, and she could have been hired by either Tianji or Tianxuan. However, this option is not as straightforward as option A, as it requires more assumptions about the hiring process.\n\nAs for options C and D, they are both incorrect. Option C states that only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan, which contradicts the information that Li was hired by Tianshu. Option D states that only Wang was hired by Tianxuan, which is also impossible given the information that Li was hired by Tianshu.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the correct answer could be either option A or option B. However, I would choose option A as it is a more straightforward and logical conclusion based on the given information."
