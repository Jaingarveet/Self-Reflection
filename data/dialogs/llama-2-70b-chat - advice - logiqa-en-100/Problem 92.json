After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning.\nHere's my revised solution:\nLet's denote the statements made by the three professors as follows:\nZhao: \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.\"\nQian: \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.\"\nSun: \"The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.\"\nWe know that only one of the professors made a correct statement, and one of their statements is entirely wrong. We also know that the winner is not the Tsinghua University team.\nFrom Zhao's statement, we can conclude that the champion is not the Zhejiang University team.\nFrom Qian's statement, we can conclude that the champion is not the University of Science and Technology of China team.\nFrom Sun's statement, we can conclude that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team.\nNow, let's consider the possible cases:\n1. The champion is the Tsinghua University team.\nIn this case, Zhao's statement is wrong, and Qian's statement is correct. However, this contradicts the fact that only one of the professors made a correct statement.\n2. The champion is the Zhejiang University team.\nIn this case, Zhao's statement is correct, and Qian's statement is wrong. However, this contradicts the fact that the winner is not the Zhejiang University team.\n3. The champion is the University of Science and Technology of China team.\nIn this case, Qian's statement is correct, and Sun's statement is wrong. However, this contradicts the fact that only one of the professors made a correct statement.\n4. The champion is the China University of Science and Technology team.\nIn this case, Sun's statement is correct, and Zhao's statement is wrong. This is the only possible case that satisfies all the given conditions.\nTherefore, the winner is the China University of Science and Technology team.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
