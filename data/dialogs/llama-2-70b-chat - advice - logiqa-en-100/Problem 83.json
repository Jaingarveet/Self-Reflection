Unless F participates, M does not participate.\n\nNow, let's consider the given choices:\n\nA: F and G - This choice satisfies conditions 1 and 3, but it violates condition 4 since M does not participate.\n\nC: F and K - This choice satisfies conditions 1 and 2, but it violates condition 3 since G does not participate.\n\nB: E and M - This choice satisfies conditions 1 and 4, but it violates condition 2 since J does not participate.\n\nD: G and K - This choice satisfies conditions 3 and 4, but it violates condition 1 since E or F has to participate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: E and M.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
