(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: If H is in Team 2, which of the listed arrangements is acceptable for Team 1?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N\n  B: Before? G In? K After? N\n  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G\n  D: Before? G Middle? K After?

According to condition 6, if H is in Team 2, Q is in the middle of Team 1. So, the middle position of Team 1 must be Q.\nNow, let's look at condition 1. If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front. Since H is already in Team 2, G must be in the front of Team 1.\nCondition 2 states that K must be in the middle. Since Q is already in the middle of Team 1, K must be in the middle of Team 2.\nCondition 3 states that L must be on Team 1. Since G is already in the front of Team 1, L must be in the back of Team 1.\nNow, let's look at condition 4. Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. Since K is in Team 2, N must be in Team 1.\nCondition 5 states that P cannot be in the same team as Q. Since Q is in Team 1, P must be in Team 2.\nNow, we can draw the following diagram:\n\nTeam 1:\nBefore: G\nMiddle: Q\nAfter: L\n\nTeam 2:\nBefore: H\nMiddle: K\nAfter: P\n\nThis diagram satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
