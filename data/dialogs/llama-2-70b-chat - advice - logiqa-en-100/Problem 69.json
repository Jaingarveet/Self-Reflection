I incorrectly assumed that Li Si's bonus was higher than Wang Wu's, which led me to choose option C.\n\nHowever, upon reflection, I realized that the information provided in the question does not allow us to determine the relative bonus amounts of Li Si and Wang Wu. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.\n\nThe correct answer is option A: Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's. This option is consistent with the information provided in the question, as we know that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's, and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, which means it must also be higher than Li Si's.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
