Premier Wen Jiabao's statement is not about the difficulty of living a good life or threatening others, but rather about the impact of China's large population on its affairs and the importance of being cautious for politicians.\n\nTherefore, the closest option to what Premier Wen Jiabao said is:\n\nB: China's large population makes China's affairs very complicated and arduous, so remember to be cautious for politicians.\n\nThis option accurately reflects the message conveyed by Premier Wen Jiabao in the given context."
