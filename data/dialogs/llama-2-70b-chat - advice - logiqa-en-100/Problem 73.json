We need to consider all possible scenarios and combinations that satisfy all the given conditions.\nWe know that G must be in the front, so let's start by placing G in team 1's front position.\nCondition (2) states that K must be in the middle, so we'll place K in team 1's middle position.\nNow, we need to fill the back position of team 1. We cannot place P in team 1 because of condition (4), and we cannot place N in team 1 because of condition (6). Therefore, the only option for the back position in team 1 is L.\nSo, the pair of magicians that can be in team 1 if G is in team 1 is G, K, and L.\nThe correct answer is option A: K and L.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
