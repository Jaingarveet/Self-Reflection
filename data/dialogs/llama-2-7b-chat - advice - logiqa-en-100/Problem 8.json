However, the information provided only reveals that Xiao Qiang's study time is longer than Xiao Gang's and that Xiao Qiang has more books than Xiao Gang. It does not provide any information about their intelligence, knowledge, or treatment of life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
