The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is not the only obstacle hindering the passage of giant ships on the Yangtze River. Other bridges along the river, such as the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing, and other places, also have a clear height of 24 meters, which can also hinder the passage of large ships. Additionally, shipbuilding technology has advanced significantly, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. Therefore, demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge may not completely solve the problem of hindering the passage of giant ships on the Yangtze River.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
