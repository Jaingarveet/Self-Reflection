However, this conclusion may be weakened if there are other factors that could explain the increase in these types of posts.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting \"A\" as the correct answer. Upon further reflection, I realized that the statement \"Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles\" is not relevant to the argument and does not provide any insight into the reason for the increase in negative posts.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C\", as the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people could be due to the increasing use of social media for profit-making purposes. This could explain why these types of posts have increased by 90% in the past year, rather than indicating a deterioration in the social atmosphere."
