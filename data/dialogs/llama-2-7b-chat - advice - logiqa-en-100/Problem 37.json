The statement \"The quality of life in Huaizhou depends only on its economic growth and natural living environment\" is too broad and does not take into account the impact of industrial pollution on the city's development prospects.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nI realized that the correct answer is Choice B, \"Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment.\" This statement is supported by the information provided in the passage, which states that the city's development depends on industry, but industry inevitably produces pollution, threatening the city's air, water, and buildings. This means that the city will likely face challenges in both economic growth and environmental protection."
