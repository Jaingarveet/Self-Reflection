Liu Xiang's statement that \"Yellow-skinned athletes cannot be old Behind black athletes\" directly challenges the idea that only black athletes can become track and field champions, but it does not address the broader assertion that all sprint kings are yellow-skinned players.\n\nI made the mistake of assuming that Liu Xiang's statement was a rebuttal to the assertion that black athletes are the only ones who can become track and field champions, but upon further reflection, I realize that it is not a direct refutation of that assertion.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (B) All sprint kings are not yellow-skinned players."
