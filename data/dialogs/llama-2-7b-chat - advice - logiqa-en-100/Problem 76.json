Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI mistakenly chose option A, which is not a valid argument to refute the given argument. The argument being made is that all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, therefore Taiwanese are not Chinese.\n\nTo refute this argument, a valid reasoning would be to point out that the definition of \"Chinese\" is not solely determined by political jurisdiction. There are many factors that contribute to a person's identity as Chinese, such as culture, language, history, and heritage. Taiwanese people, despite being under a different political jurisdiction, share many of these cultural and historical ties with mainland China and can therefore be considered Chinese.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D, which provides a valid reasoning to refute the given argument."
