I incorrectly assumed that Chessman A's victory over Chessman B meant that Chessman A was stronger than Chessman C. However, the information provided in the problem states that the six players are of equal strength. Therefore, Chessman A's victory over Chessman B does not give any advantage to Chessman A in the match against Chessman C.\n\nAction: Based on the new information, I predict that the match between Chess Armor and Chessman C will be tied.\n\nAnswer: C) The two will be tied."
