The argument assumes that the judges' opinions are the only ones that matter, and that everyone else's opinions are irrelevant. However, this is not a valid conclusion, as it ignores the possibility that there may be other, valid perspectives that are not based on personal opinions.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The above argument has a logical error of \"confused concept\". The argument confuses the concept of personal opinions with the concept of objective truth. While personal opinions are subjective and can vary from person to person, objective truth is based on evidence and can be verified through reasoning and observation. The argument fails to distinguish between these two concepts, leading to its logical error.\n\nIn conclusion, the above argument is flawed due to its confusion of concepts, and it is not a valid way to determine the correctness of a statement."
