This implies that both developed and developing countries have polluting enterprises, which is the correct answer.\n\nOption (A) A good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries is incorrect because the economist did not make any mention of the importance of the natural environment in the argument.\n\nOption (C) The degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious than in developing countries is also incorrect because the economist did not provide any information to support this claim.\n\nOption (D) Polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries than in developed countries is not supported by the argument, as the economist mentioned that both developed and developing countries benefited from the improvement of the natural environment.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Both developed and developing countries have polluting enterprises."
