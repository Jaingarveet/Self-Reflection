E or F has one person to participate, but not both.\n2. One of J or K will participate, but not both.\n3. If J participates, then G participates.\n4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.\n\nUsing these conditions, I can eliminate some of the options:\n\nOption A: F and H - This option violates condition 1, as both F and H will participate.\n\nOption C: G and M - This option violates condition 2, as neither J nor K will participate.\n\nOption B: G and J - This option violates condition 3, as J does not participate.\n\nOption D: H and M - This option violates condition 4, as F does not participate.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"A: F and H\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe coach needs to select two players from the remaining options that meet all the conditions. F and H are the only options that satisfy all the conditions, so the coach will select them to make the four-person team the only choice."
