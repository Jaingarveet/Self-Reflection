Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\nAction: I will use the given conditions to determine the possible allocations of the 7 employees.\n\n1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they cannot be in different departments.\n2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department, so F must be in a different department than G.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W must be allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the choices:\n\nA: G is assigned to the sales department. This is not possible because G cannot be in the same department as F.\n\nB: H is assigned to the production department. This is possible because H and Y can be in the same department.\n\nC: I was assigned to the sales department. This is not possible because I is not one of the 7 employees.\n\nD: W is assigned to the public relations department. This is not possible because W must be in the production department if X is in the sales department.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: H is assigned to the production department."
