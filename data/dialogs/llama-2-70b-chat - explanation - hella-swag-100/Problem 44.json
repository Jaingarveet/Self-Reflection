You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people.\n\nMy reasoning for this answer is that the text mentions that the size of the bottle will affect the size of the hits, and that a larger bottle will produce larger hits. Therefore, the next logical step would be to suggest that if you're smoking alone, a small bottle would be sufficient, but if you're smoking with multiple people, a larger bottle would be needed.\n\nI believe that option (A) [substeps] If you are using an empty bottle, ensure that the nozzle is clean and dry before you use it.
