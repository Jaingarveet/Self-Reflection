But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. These results, which have not been equaled by quantum theory's competitors, warrant acceptance of quantum theory.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than do its competitors.\n  B: A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.\n  C: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.\n  D: A theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it.\n  E: A theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

Here is my self-reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstood the question\n* Did not consider the correct principle\n\nSolution:\nThe correct principle that most helps to justify the reasoning above is:\n\nC: The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage states that despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. This suggests that the consequences of quantum theory are not counterintuitive, as they have been found to be accurate. Therefore, principle C is the best answer.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen answering questions, it is important to carefully read and understand the passage, and to consider all of the available choices before making a selection. Reflecting on one's own solution and the correct answer can also help to ensure that the correct principle is selected."
