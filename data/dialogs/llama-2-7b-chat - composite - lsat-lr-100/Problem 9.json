The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either.\n  B: Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.\n  C: Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning.\n  D: Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics.\n  E: Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
