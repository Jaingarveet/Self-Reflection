        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.\n  B: Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.\n  C: Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations.\n  D: A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\n  E: A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe editorial's argument depends on the assumption that agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens. This assumption is choice (B).\n\nThe editorial argues that the current school calendar was established to meet the needs of early-twentieth-century agricultural life, but since most citizens no longer work in agriculture, the long breaks in the school calendar are no longer necessary. Therefore, the editorial suggests removing long breaks from the school calendar to better serve the interests of children.\n\nChoices (A), (C), and (D) are not assumptions on which the editorial's argument depends. Choice (A) is incorrect because the editorial does not suggest that children forget what they have learned during long breaks. Choice (C) is incorrect because the editorial does not propose replacing long breaks with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations. Choice (D) is incorrect because the editorial does not argue that shortening breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice (E), which states that a school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
