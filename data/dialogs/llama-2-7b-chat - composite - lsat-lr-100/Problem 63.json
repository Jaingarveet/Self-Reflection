The correct answer is (B) Many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument above is flawed because it makes an assumption that is not supported by evidence. The argument assumes that if the party's economic theories were sound and it had succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. However, this is not necessarily true, as there could be other factors that affect the inflation rate, such as changes in global economic conditions or unexpected events.\n\nThe correct answer, (B), recognizes that the flawed reasoning is based on an assumption that is not supported by evidence. The argument assumes that the workers' decision not to strike is based on their belief that the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as the workers may have other reasons for not striking, such as personal financial circumstances or other factors.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen answering this question, it is important to carefully evaluate the argument and identify the flawed assumption. Look for any assumptions that are not supported by evidence and challenge them with counterarguments or alternative explanations. By doing so, you can identify the correct answer and avoid making the same mistake as before."
