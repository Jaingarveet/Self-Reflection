Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft.\n  B: Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to.\n  C: If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission.\n  D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.\n  E: Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMike's reasoning can be justified based on the principle of \"lex non scripta\" or \"customary law,\" which allows for the use of something without permission if it has been used in a similar manner by others in the past. This principle is similar to option [REDACTED].\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because using someone's property without their permission is generally considered theft, regardless of whether the person has used someone else's property without permission.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while it is generally important to tell the truth, there may be cases where it is permissible not to tell the truth, such as in situations where the truth could cause harm to someone.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while it may be permissible to use someone's property without their permission if they have used someone else's property without permission, this is not the same as saying that it is okay to use someone's property without their permission simply because someone else has done so.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the use of someone's property may be wrong even if the person is not directly harmed by that use. For example, using someone's property without their permission may still be considered a violation of their rights or a breach of trust.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

Based on your reflection, I understand that the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nMike's reasoning can be justified based on the principle of \"lex non scripta\" or \"customary law,\" which allows for the use of something without permission if it has been used in a similar manner by others in the past. This principle is similar to option [REDACTED].\n\nIn this scenario, Tom using Mary's bicycle without her permission can be seen as a precedent for Mike using Tom's computer without his permission. Both Tom and Mike are treating each other's property in a similar manner to how they have been treated by others in the past. Therefore, Mike's reasoning can be justified based on this principle.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because using someone's property without their permission is generally considered theft, regardless of whether the person has used someone else's property without permission.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while it is generally important to tell the truth, there may be cases where it is permissible not to tell the truth, such as in situations where the truth could cause harm to someone.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because while it may be permissible to use someone's property without their permission if they have used someone else's property without permission, this is not the same as saying that it is okay to use someone's property without their permission simply because someone else has done so.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the use of someone's property may be wrong even if the person is not directly harmed by that use.
