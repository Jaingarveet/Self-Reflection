This is a classic logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent,\" where the conclusion is assumed to be true without sufficient evidence.\n\nIn this scenario, Morgenstern's argument is based on an assumption that Brooks will not find another job if he quits his current one, without considering other factors that may influence Brooks' job search, such as his skills, experience, and network. Morgenstern's argument fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance, and that Brooks may be willing to take a risk to improve his job satisfaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Morgenstern's argument is flawed because it relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true."
