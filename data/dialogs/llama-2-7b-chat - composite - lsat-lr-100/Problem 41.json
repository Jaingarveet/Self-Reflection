The argument assumes that Riley's claim is false simply because of her feud with the president, without considering whether there may be other reasons to deem the speech inflammatory. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity towards the university president is well-founded.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory\n* Fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences\n* Favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing\n* Concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true\n\nSolution:\nTo correctly answer the question, it is important to consider the possibility that Riley's animosity towards the university president may be well-founded, and to adequately address this possibility in the argument.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen answering this question, it is important to carefully consider the argument and to identify any assumptions that may be underlying it. It is also important to be aware of the possibility that Riley's animosity towards the university president may be well-founded, and to adequately address this possibility in the argument."
