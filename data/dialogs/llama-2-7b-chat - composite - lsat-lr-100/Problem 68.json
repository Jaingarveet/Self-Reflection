So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.\nQuestion: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners\n  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog\n  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city\n  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood\n  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe argument is based on the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined.
