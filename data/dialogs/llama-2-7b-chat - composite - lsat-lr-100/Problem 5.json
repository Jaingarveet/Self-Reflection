Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above?\nChoices:\n  A: The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953.\n  B: The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953.\n  C: The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years.\n  D: The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953.\n  E: Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]\n\nThe passage states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953, yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged. This implies that the increase in the number of tornadoes must be due to some other factor. Choice [REDACTED] suggests that the increase in the number of tornadoes has only occurred in the last five years, which is a more specific and plausible explanation for the discrepancy.\n\nThe other choices do not provide a plausible explanation for the discrepancy:\n\n* Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because the factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were likely known to meteorologists before 1953, and the discrepancy cannot be explained by a lack of knowledge.\n* Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the intensity of the average tornado has increased over time.\n* Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because while property damage from tornadoes has certainly increased over time, this does not explain the discrepancy in the number of tornadoes recorded.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953, which provides a plausible explanation for the discrepancy in the number of tornadoes recorded.\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
