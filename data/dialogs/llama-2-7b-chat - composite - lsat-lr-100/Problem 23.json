As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination?\nChoices:\n  A: It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.\n  B: It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments.\n  C: It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.\n  D: It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs.\n  E: It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

The correct answer is (C) It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence.\n\nThe teacher presents the argument that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination as a potential reason for funding children's athletic programs. However, the teacher also acknowledges that this argument may not be sufficient on its own to justify funding, as critics have raised concerns about the potential negative impact of athletic programs on children's self-esteem. Therefore, the teacher offers additional evidence to support their argument, such as the finding that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties.\n\nIn conclusion, the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination is presented as a hypothesis in the teacher's argument, and additional evidence is offered to support this hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence."
