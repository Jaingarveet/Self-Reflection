However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

Here is my self-reflection:\n\nError Keywords: Illegal recording, punitive measures, guilt, justification\n\nSolution: The correct answer is (E) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\n\nExplanation: The argument above highlights the principle that justification for punitive measures cannot be based on illegal means. In this case, the company obtained the evidence of Ellison's illegal transactions by illegally recording his conversations. Therefore, even though Ellison has admitted to the illegal transactions, the company cannot take punitive measures against him.\n\nThe other options do not illustrate the same principle:\n\n(A) does not fit the scenario as Price's guilt does not affect Long's ability to take punitive measures against him.\n\n(B) is not relevant as it involves a different scenario of an individual admitting to an illegal act without justification.\n\n(C) is not applicable as it involves a different scenario of an individual being punished for an illegal act committed by someone else.\n\n(D) is not applicable as it involves a different scenario of an individual being punished for an illegal act committed by someone else, and the punishment is not justified based on the circumstances.\n\n(E) is the best answer as it illustrates the principle that justification for punitive measures cannot be based on illegal means. The board of directors has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties in the past, which means they cannot justifiably take punitive measures against Ramirez based on the same principle."
