This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nQuestion: If the above statements are true, which one of the following statements must also be true?\nChoices:\n  A: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n  B: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n  C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n  D: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\n  E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (D): [REDACTED]\n\nThe given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that most of the Canadian films that won prizes at international film festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. The statements only provide information about the relationship between the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and international film festivals, but they do not provide information about the relationship between the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and Canadian films.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D), which states that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\n\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the absence of information does not necessarily imply a false statement.\n"

The correct answer is (D): Not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n1. The statement \"This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival\" implies that there is a relationship between the two.\n2. The statement \"Most of the Canadian films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival\" does not provide enough information to conclude that most of the Canadian films that won prizes at international film festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n3. The statement \"Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films\" does not provide enough information to conclude that most of the Canadian films that won prizes at international film festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n4. The statement \"This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival\" is the correct answer, as it provides the necessary information to conclude that not all Canadian films that won prizes at international film festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nIn conclusion, I made a mistake in my initial answer, and I apologize for any confusion caused. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and improve my problem-solving skills."
