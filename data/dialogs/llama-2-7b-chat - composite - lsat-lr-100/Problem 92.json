It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.\n  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.\n  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.\n  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

The correct assumption required by the curator's argument is:\n\nC: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.\n\nExplanation:\nThe curator's argument hinges on the idea that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb upside down, which suggests that it was a religious object rather than a child's toy. The assumption that the tomb was not reentered until archaeologists opened it ensures that the hippopotamus remained in its original position, with its legs broken off, until it was discovered. Without this assumption, it is possible that the hippopotamus was placed in the tomb in a different position, or that its legs were broken off at a later time.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child. (REDACTED)\n* B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's toys in ancient Egypt. (REDACTED)\n* D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken through some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb. (REDACTED)\n* E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb. (REDACTED)"
