Specifically, I did not fully think through the consequences of condition (3) in combination with the other conditions. This led me to incorrectly conclude that none of the choices must be true, when in fact choice [REDACTED] must be true based on the given information.\n"

So choice A is false.\n(2) Papers G and H can't both be used together based on condition (2). So choice B is false. \n(3) If paper G is not used, then paper K is also not used according to condition (3).\n(4) We already determined paper E can't be used.\nThe key insight is realizing the implications of condition (3). If G is not used, then K is also not used.\nCombining this with condition (2), we can deduce that if J is used, then neither G nor K can be used. \nTherefore, the only possible true statement is choice D - if J is used, then both G and K are unnecessary.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
