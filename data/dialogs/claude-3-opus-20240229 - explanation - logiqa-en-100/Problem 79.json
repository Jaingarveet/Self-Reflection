However, upon further reflection, I realize that choice [REDACTED] is actually the one that does not pose a doubt or rebuttal. Choice [REDACTED] in fact supports the existence of the external world by pointing to the practical successes of science. My error was in misinterpreting the question and not carefully considering how each choice relates to the argument.\n"

It is a valid doubt.\nB: Questioning how we can prove others have similar experiences casts doubt on part of the argument's evidence. It's a relevant challenge.\nC: Stating that mirages are real existences rather than illusions actually supports the reliability of visual experience and the external world. It does not express doubt.\nD: Highlighting the success of natural science, which relies on an external world, provides support for that external world's existence. Like C, it is not a rebuttal but an additional point in favor of the argument.\nTherefore, C is the choice that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
