Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors. \n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.\nFrom (2), we know Wang Wei and Wu Gang are the 2 doctors. So the handsome man and the 3rd tall man must be either Liu Dawei or Li Qiang.\nFrom (3), Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height. They are either both tall or both not tall. \nFrom (4), Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. So if Li Qiang is tall, then Wang Wei is not tall. But we need 3 tall men total. \nThe only way to have 3 tall men is if:\n- Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are both tall (from 3)\n- Wu Gang is tall (to have 3 total tall men)\n- Wang Wei is not tall (from 4)\nSo Wu Gang is the only one who can be tall, a doctor, and handsome, meeting all of Li Na's conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
