It also states that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.\n3. Therefore, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will have also increased productivity by 10%, thus avoiding bankruptcy.\n4. The correct answer is the one that logically follows from these statements.\nLooking at the choices:\nA: This is not necessarily true. If Green Island increases productivity by 10% but not 20%, it will still avoid bankruptcy.\nB: This is correct. If Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will have also increased by 10%, thus avoiding bankruptcy.\nC: This may be true, but it's not a necessary conclusion from the given statements.\nD: This contradicts the given information, which states that a 10% increase implies a 20% increase is possible.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
