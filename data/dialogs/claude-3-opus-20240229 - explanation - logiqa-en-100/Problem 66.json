(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI failed to consider all possible arrangements of the islands given the constraints. I correctly identified that G must be the northernmost island and that F must be directly north of H. However, I did not account for the fact that I and E can be arranged in two different ways relative to each other, and these arrangements can occur on either side of the F-H pair.\n"

F must be directly north of H. \n3. I and E are adjacent to each other, but their order can vary. There are two possibilities:\n   a) I is north of E\n   b) E is north of I\n4. The I-E pair can be placed either south of H, or north of F. \nSo the possible arrangements are:\n1. G - F - H - I - E \n2. G - F - H - E - I\n3. G - I - E - F - H\n4. G - E - I - F - H\nTherefore, there are 4 possible arrangements of the islands.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
