(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\nQuestion: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?\nChoices:\n  A: Tang Xiaohua\n  B: Peng Youwen\n  C: Qiu Zhijie\n  D: Song Wenkai\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the selected girls if He Zhilian is not selected. However, I then incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] could be selected since Guo Yanran was selected. I failed to consider that if [REDACTED] is selected, then both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot be selected due to the given conditions. This would leave only Ren Xiangyang and [REDACTED] as possible selections for the boys, which is not enough.\n"

Now let's consider the conditions for the boys:\n   - Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together\n   - Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together \n   - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together\n3. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected due to condition (1).\n4. This leaves us with Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai as possible selections for the 3 boys.\n5. However, due to conditions (2) and (3), if either Peng Youwen or Song Wenkai is selected, then the other cannot be. \n6. This means we must select Qiu Zhijie and Ren Xiangyang, plus either Peng Youwen or Song Wenkai.\nTherefore, the person who is definitely not selected is Tang Xiaohua.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
