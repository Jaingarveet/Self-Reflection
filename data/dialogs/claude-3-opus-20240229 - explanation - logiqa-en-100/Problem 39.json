It either recognizes shape (type B) or neither color nor shape (type C). \n3. If Robot 1 was type A, it would have picked up the red balls correctly. Since it didn't, it must be type C.\n4. Similarly, if Robot 2 was type B, it would have picked up the red balls (the correct shape). Since it didn't, it must also be type C.\n5. Therefore, the only possibility consistent with the experiment results is that both Robot 1 and Robot 2 are type C - they can recognize neither color nor shape.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
