        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.\nQuestion: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?\nChoices:\n  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\n  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\n  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI selected an answer that seemed to support the expert's view rather than cast doubt on it. Choice [REDACTED] suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary, while I failed to recognize that Choice [REDACTED] provides evidence directly contradicting the expert's claim that the bridge must be demolished to allow giant ships to pass.\n"

It does not raise doubts.\nB: This directly contradicts the expert's claim. If 99% of large international ships moor below the bridge anyway, demolishing it to allow their passage seems unnecessary. This casts significant doubt on the expert's assertion.\nC: This suggests the problem is broader than just the Nanjing Bridge. While relevant context, it doesn't directly challenge the expert's specific claim about the Nanjing Bridge.\nD: This indicates that some large (8000-ton) ships are already able to pass through, which seems to undermine the expert's argument that demolition is required to enable passage. However, the expert referred to allowing \"giant ships\", which may be even larger than 8000 tons.\nTherefore, choice B most directly challenges the expert's core claim by suggesting that demolishing the bridge is not actually necessary for the stated goal of enabling passage of large international ships, since they rarely go above Nanjing anyway.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
