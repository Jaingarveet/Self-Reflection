Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": " Explanation:\nI incorrectly selected answer \"D\" as the correct response. The correct answer is actually \"B\".\n\nThe oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat, including:\n\n* Harming or killing marine life, including fish, birds, and other organisms that depend on the coastal ecosystem.\n* Coating or smothering plants and habitats, reducing their ability to photosynthesize and providing shelter for marine life.\n* Altering the water's chemistry, reducing the amount of oxygen available and affecting the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nThe other options are not accurate descriptions of how the oil spill will affect the coastal habitat:\n\n* Option \"A\" is incorrect because oil spills can actually have a negative impact on fish reproduction rates, rather than increasing them.\n* Option \"C\" is incorrect because oil spills can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching water plants, rather than exposing them to more sunlight.\n* Option \"D\" is incorrect because coastal plants may not have access to more nutrients as a result of an oil spill.\n\nSolution:\nThe ship leaked oil near a coastal area.\nThe oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat.\nThe oil will harm or kill marine life and alter the water's chemistry.\nThe correct answer is \"B\".\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the location of the oil spill.\n2. Determine the type of impact the oil spill will have on the coastal habitat.\n3. Consider the effects of the oil spill on marine life, including fish, birds, and other organisms.\n4. Analyze the impact of the oil spill on the water's chemistry and the overall health of the ecosystem.\n5. Choose the answer that best describes the impact of the oil spill on the coastal habitat.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Consider the potential impact of the oil spill on the entire ecosystem, including marine life and water quality.\n* Think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that oil spills can have far-reaching and long-lasting impacts on coastal habitats and marine life."
