I thought that a gas keeps its shape when placed in a container, but that is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nC: A gas takes the shape of its container.\n\nExplanation:\nWhen the teacher opens the can of food, the gas molecules inside the can are able to move freely and spread out into the surrounding air. Since the gas molecules are not attached to any particular shape, they are able to take on the shape of their container, which in this case is the classroom. As a result, the students are able to smell the food because the gas molecules from the food are able to reach their noses.\n\nKeywords:\n\n* Gas\n* Shape\n* Container\n* Molecules\n* Smell\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food.\n2. Explain why the students are able to smell the food.\n3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that gases take the shape of their containers, not the other way around."
