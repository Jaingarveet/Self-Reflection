Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I thought that as water changes state from steam to liquid, the molecules slow down and move closer together, which is not the correct explanation.\n\nThe correct statement that best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid is:\n\nD: The molecules move slower and occupy less space.\n\nAs water changes state from steam to liquid, the molecules actually move faster and occupy more space. This is because the molecules gain kinetic energy and move more quickly as they transition from a gas to a liquid.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the motion of molecules\n* Incorrect reasoning\n* Mistake in thinking\n\nSolution:\n\nAs water changes state from steam to liquid, the molecules move faster and occupy more space.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Understand the concept of state changes in water.\n2. Recall the correct explanation of the motion of molecules during state changes.\n3. Identify the mistake in my reasoning.\n4. Correct my answer to choose the correct statement.\n5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always double-check your work and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n* Make sure you understand the concept and process of state changes in water.\n* Pay close attention to the motion of molecules during state changes.\n* Use visual aids or diagrams to help you visualize the motion of molecules."
