        "content": " Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly by selecting option C, which states that the object will continue to move in the same direction. However, the correct answer is option D, which states that the object will move in the same direction as the larger force.\n\nThe reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the concept of forces acting in opposite directions. I thought that the object would continue to move in the same direction due to the equal and opposite forces, but in reality, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the concept of forces\n* Confusion between equal and opposite forces\n\nSolution:\nWhen two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force. The correct calculation is:\n\nF = ma\n\nWhere F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. Since the larger force is acting in the same direction as the acceleration, the object will accelerate in that direction.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the two forces acting on the object.\n2. Determine the direction of each force.\n3. Calculate the net force acting on the object using the formula F = ma.\n4. Determine the acceleration of the object based on the net force and mass.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the correct explanation.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully read the question and understand the problem before answering.\n* Use the correct formula to calculate the net force and acceleration of the object.\n* Pay attention to the direction of the forces and how they affect the object's motion.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy."
