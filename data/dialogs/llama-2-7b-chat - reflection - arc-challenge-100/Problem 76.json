Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Which energy source produces waste products that can have these effects for the longest amount of time?\nChoices:\n  A: natural gas\n  B: uranium\n  C: crude oil\n  D: coal\n\n  Thought: Burning nonrenewable resources for energy produces waste products that can have long-term negative effects on Earth's subsystems. The waste products from different energy sources can have varying durations of impact.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation: Coal is the energy source that produces waste products that can have the longest amount of time to have negative effects on Earth's subsystems. Coal burning produces fly ash, bottom ash, and sulfur dioxide, which can remain in the environment for centuries, causing air and water pollution, acid rain, and climate change. These effects can have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
