Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option is not the best choice.\n\nWhen the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations. Option B, \"change the hypothesis to match the results,\" is a more appropriate response in this situation.\n\nHere's why:\n\nOption A, \"perform the investigation in a different way,\" may be necessary if the initial investigation was flawed or if there were limitations to the methodology that could have affected the results. However, if the results do not match the hypothesis, it is important to consider alternative explanations and revise the hypothesis accordingly.\n\nOption C, \"choose a different investigation,\" is not the best choice because it does not address the issue of the discrepancy between the results and the hypothesis.\n\nOption D, \"repeat the investigation,\" is a good choice because it allows Michelle to gather more data and potentially obtain more accurate results. However, it is important to note that repeating the investigation without addressing the issues with the initial investigation may lead to the same results.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is option D, \"repeat the investigation.\"\n\nKeywords:\n\n* Critical evaluation\n* Alternative explanations\n* Revision of hypothesis\n* Data gathering\n* Accurate results\n\nAdvice:\n\n* When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations.\n* Revising the hypothesis based on the results of the investigation is a crucial step in the scientific process.\n* Gathering more data through repetition of the investigation can help to obtain more accurate results.\n* It is important to be systematic and thorough in the investigation to avoid repeating the same mistakes."
