        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\n\n  Thought: The introduction of a new predator to the island will likely lead to a decrease in the population of both dark and light wool sheep, as the predator will pose a threat to all of the sheep.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

However, the correct answer is option B, which states that a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool will occur first.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is that the introduction of a new predator to the island will pose a threat to all of the sheep, regardless of their wool color. Therefore, the population of both dark and light wool sheep will decrease.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the scenario\n* Overlooking important details\n* Incorrect reasoning\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is option B, which states that a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool will occur first.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Recognize that the introduction of a new predator to the island will pose a threat to all of the sheep.\n2. Understand that the population of both dark and light wool sheep will decrease.\n3. Choose the answer that best explains the most likely outcome.\n4.
