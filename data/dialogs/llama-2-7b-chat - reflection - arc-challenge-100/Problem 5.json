I incorrectly calculated the amount of sugar in the solution.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\n10 grams of sugar dissolved in 100 grams of water = 100 grams of sugar-and-water solution\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 110 grams.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Miscalculation\n* Mistake\n* Incorrect calculation\n\nSolution:\n\nTo find the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution, we need to use the fact that 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.\n\nStep-by-step calculation:\n\n1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.\n2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution: 10 grams / 100 grams = 0.1 grams (or 100 grams)\n\nTherefore, the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution is 110 grams (C).\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.\n2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution using the given information.\n3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the amount of sugar in the solution is directly proportional to the amount of sugar dissolved in the water."
