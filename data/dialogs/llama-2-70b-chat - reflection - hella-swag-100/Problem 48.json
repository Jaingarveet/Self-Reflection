[step] The variety of speaker builds suits individual speakers for different tasks. For casual music listening, a pair of bookshelf speakers would be more than enough.\nChoices:\n  A: For, for church music listening, a pair of high performance speakers would be perfect for easy listening during worship periods. For assembly groups, a 4-prong speaker would be adequate, but for parties, ladies could now stand between the blocks.\n  B: However, for business calls or social gatherings you may also consider other options; ipods and digital speakers are both available. It's important to consider the quality of your speakers, along with the layout of your space.\n  C: Personal speakers are fairly easy to get into. A solo recording of 10 seconds played on your ipod or two of jumps up and down on a bulletin board might work for the majority of speakers.\n  D: Those who desire a more intensive experience can upgrade to standing speakers. Surround sound systems are also a high-end option.\n\n  Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nThe text discusses how to shop for speakers and suggests considering the intended use of the speakers when making a decision.
