Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

[step] The chemical ingredients in thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate. Once exposed to air, the wrap should immediately begin heating, reaching its maximum temperature in about half an hour.\nChoices:\n  A: Attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly. [substeps] Do not microwave the wrap, or attempt to speed up the warming by heating it in any other fashion.\n  B: [substeps] There are a few precautions you must take regarding opening the wrap before using a thermacare on your entire body when it is hot outside. You must also take steps: stand close to a wall with plenty of space in between the heat wrap and the wall and ceiling.\n  C: Make sure that the wraps are not exposed to the heat coming from the candles/fans/jars, through the open oven door, or in the freezer. [title] Place one layer of foil on top of the wrapped wrap.\n  D: [substeps] Do not open the wrap until you have activated each ingredient without doing so. You may wish to break the wrap open to better see, or set a timer for a few minutes, so that you do not open the wrap while doing so.\n\n  Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage explains that the chemical ingredients in Thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate, and that attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is choice A, which states that attaching the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly.\n\nThe other choices do not relate to the topic of activating Thermacare heat wraps. Choice B discusses precautions for using a Thermacare wrap on your entire body when it is hot outside, but does not relate to activating the wrap. Choice C suggests placing one layer of foil on top of the wrapped wrap, but this is not related to activating the wrap. Choice D suggests breaking the wrap open to better see or setting a timer, but this is not necessary for activating the wrap.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
