Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

[step] An empty water bottle or liter of soda will work. You can use any size bottle, but keep in mind that the bigger the bottle, the bigger the gravity bong hits will be.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] If you are using an empty bottle, ensure that the nozzle is clean and dry before you use it. If you're using an empty bottle, use a zip lock or a sheet of tin foil.\n  B: [title] Cut a slit and feed all of the plastic in the slit into the bottle. [step] Make sure that you cut tight enough to keep the plastic in place if you're using an empty bottle.\n  C: [substeps] If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people.\n  D: [title] Put on rubber gloves to avoid snapping the plastic skin of the bottle. [step] This won't break the bottle.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe given text provides instructions on how to make a gravity bong, specifically mentioning the use of an empty plastic bottle. Option A provides substeps that are relevant to the given instructions, focusing on ensuring the cleanliness and dryness of the nozzle and using a zip lock or tin foil if necessary.\n\nOption B suggests cutting a slit and feeding plastic into the bottle, which is not related to the given instructions. Option C discusses the size of the plastic bottle, but it does not logically follow from the previous steps. Option D suggests wearing rubber gloves to avoid breaking the bottle, but this is not relevant to the given instructions.\n\nTherefore, the most likely completion to the given text is Option A.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
