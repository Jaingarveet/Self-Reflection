I misinterpreted the problem and calculated Rahim's age incorrectly.\n\nThe correct solution is as follows:\n\nRaj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, which means Rahim's age was 3x = 15 years ago.\nNow, Raj is 17 years old, so Rahim's current age is 17 + 5 = 22 years old.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED] years old.\n"
