Here's my answer to the question:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is option C, which states that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to x3/y2 units. This is because the product of the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day affects the total amount of work completed. As I previously reflected, the ratio of work completed does change with the number of workers, so option C is the correct answer."
