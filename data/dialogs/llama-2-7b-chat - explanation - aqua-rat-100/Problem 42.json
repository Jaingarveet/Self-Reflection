The problem requires me to find the length of a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. The distance between each pair of pickets is 6 inches.\n\nTo find the length of the fence, I need to divide the number of pickets by 2 and multiply by the width of each picket. Therefore, the correct calculation is:\n\nLength of fence = Number of pickets x Width of each picket / 2\n= 13x / 2\n\nSo, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: (13x - 12) / 24.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer. Thank you for giving me another chance to solve the problem correctly."
