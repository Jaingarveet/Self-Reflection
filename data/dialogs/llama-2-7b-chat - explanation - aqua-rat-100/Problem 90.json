        "content": "  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I need to rethink my solution.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the problem again. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 on other days. If the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on other days, it means it buys 2S papers on Sunday, where S is the number of papers it buys on other days.\n\nSo, the total number of papers the hotel buys in a week is:\n\n2S x $4 = $80 (Sunday)\n+ (7 days x $1) = $70 (other days)\n\nTotal cost of newspapers in a week = $80 + $70 = $150\n\nNow, we need to find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday. Since the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, and it buys 2S papers on Sunday, the number of papers it buys on Monday is:\n\nMonday papers = $210 - $80 = $130\n\nSo, the number of papers the hotel buys on Monday is 130.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
