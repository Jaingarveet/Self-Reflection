I thought the problem was asking for the number of men required to complete the work in half a day, so I calculated the answer based on that assumption. However, the problem is actually asking for the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day, which is different.\n"

To solve this problem, I will use the information provided in the problem statement.\n\n8 men work for 6 days to complete a work, which means they complete the work in 6 days.\nTo find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to divide the number of days taken to complete the work by 2.\n\nSo, the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day is:\n8 men x 6 days / 2 = 13 men\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 97 men."
