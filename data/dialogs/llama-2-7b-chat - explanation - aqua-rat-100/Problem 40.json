How much money did John have ?\nChoices:\n  A: 22\n  B: 60\n  C: 28\n  D: 26\n  E: 18\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nGreat job! You correctly analyzed the problem step by step and arrived at the correct answer. Here's a breakdown of your thought process:\n\n1. You recognized that the problem involves proportions and set up the equation: Mark's money = John's money / 3.\n2. You solved for John's money by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3, giving you John's money = Rs.75 x 3 = Rs.[REDACTED]5.\n3. You correctly identified the answer choice that corresponded to the correct value of John's money, which was option [REDACTED] (Rs.[REDACTED]5).\n\nWell done! Here are some tips to help you with similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Always read the problem carefully and identify the key information. In this case, you noticed that John would have Rs.75 if Mark gave him one third of his money.\n2. Use proportions to relate the information given in the problem. In this case, you set up the equation Mark's money = John's money / 3.\n3. Work step by step through the problem, using the equations or formulas you've set up. Don't skip any steps!\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. In this case, you correctly multiplied both sides of the equation by 3 to arrive at John's money.\n5. Choose the answer choice that corresponds to the correct value of the variable in the problem. In this case, the correct answer was option [REDACTED] (Rs.[REDACTED]5).\n\nKeep practicing, and you'll become more confident and proficient in solving math problems!\n"
