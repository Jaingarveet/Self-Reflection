Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking about the total number of faces of the smaller cubes, rather than the number of faces that remain unpainted. I calculated the total number of faces of the smaller cubes by multiplying the number of cubes by the number of faces per cube, without considering the fact that some faces may be painted.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I need to subtract the number of faces of the cube that is painted from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes. The answer is:\n\nNumber of faces of smaller cubes that remain unpainted = Total number of faces of smaller cubes - Number of faces of the cube that is painted\n= 6 (faces of the smaller cubes) - 6 (faces of the cube that is painted)\n= 6 - 6\n= 0\n\nTherefore, the answer is E: 498.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
