Find P(A/B)?\nChoices:\nA: 0.2\nB: 0.4\nC: 0.6\nD: 1.2\nE: 1.5\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct solution is:\n\nP(A/B) = P(A) / P(B) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 0.6.\n\nExplanation:\nTo find P(A/B), we need to divide the probability of A by the probability of B. Since A and B are independent events, we can use the formula:\n\nP(A/B) = P(A) / P(B)\n\nWe know that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP(A/B) = 0.2 / 0.8 = 0.25\n\nTherefore, the probability of A given B is 0.25, or 25%."
