The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?\nChoices:\n  A: 40.8\n  B: 41.6\n  C: 42.2\n  D: 43.5\n  E: 44.8\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nYou are correct! The weight of the heavy-duty truck is [REDACTED] tons, which is answer choice [REDACTED].\n\nHere's how you can arrive at this answer:\n\nThe average weight of the group of vehicles before the new truck was added is 12.2 tons.\nThe average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons after the new truck was added.\n\nSo, the weight of the heavy-duty truck can be calculated using the formula for the arithmetic mean:\n\nArithmetic mean = (x1 + x2 + ... + xn) / n\n\nwhere x1, x2, ..., xn are the values of the variables we are averaging, and n is the number of values.\n\nIn this case, the values are the weights of the 10 vehicles, which are given as 12.2 tons. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nArithmetic mean = (12.2 + 12.2 + ... + 12.2) / 10\n\nSimplifying the formula, we get:\n\nArithmetic mean = 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons\n\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is [REDACTED] tons, which is answer choice [REDACTED].\n\nGreat job!\n"
