Here's how I miscalculated the interest rate:\n\nI divided the amount borrowed (Rs.360) by the number of installments (12) and the installment amount (Rs.31.50) to get the interest rate. However, this is not the correct way to calculate the interest rate.\n\nThe correct formula to calculate the interest rate is:\nInterest rate = (Total amount borrowed x Number of installments x Interest rate per installment) / Total amount paid\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the interest rate as follows:\nInterest rate = (Rs.360 x 12 x 1.5%) / Rs.31.50 = 1.875%\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 4.5%.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to better understand the problem and answer it correctly this time."
