Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly set up the equation for the perimeter of the rectangle. I realized this after I had already made a calculation and arrived at an incorrect answer.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\n\nIn this case, the length of the rectangle is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so the length is 4w + 1.\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is then:\nP = 2(4w + 1)\n\nSubstituting the value of w (which is half the breadth), I get:\nP = 2(4w + 1) = 2(4(b) + 1) = 8b + 2\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 8b + 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) 61 m.\n\nI hope this self-reflection helps me to better understand the problem and arrive at the correct answer."
