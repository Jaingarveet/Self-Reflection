Here's my reflection:\n\nI calculated the cost of the sewing machine after offering a 20% discount as follows:\n\nCost of sewing machine = Rs. 1200 x (1 - 0.20) = Rs. 960\n\nHowever, I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct calculation is:\n\nCost of sewing machine = Rs. 1200 x (1 - 0.20) = Rs. 1080\n\nTherefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit is:\n\nPrice = Cost + Profit = Rs. 1080 + Rs. 216 = Rs. 1306\n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) Rs. 1306.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
