If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?\nChoices:\n  A: (zy – 2x)/z\n  B: (zy – 2)/z\n  C: (zx – y)/(z – 2)\n  D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2)\n  E: (zy – x)/(z + 2)\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my answer. The correct solution is:\n\nThe average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n\nWe are given that the average of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x, and the average score for the entire class is equal to y. We also know that there are z > 5 students in the class.\n\nTo find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the average of the remaining scores.\n\nWe can do this by using the formula:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nWhere x is the average of the highest and lowest scores, y is the average score for the entire class, and z is the number of students in the class.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
