Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\n\nProblem: There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the number of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket.\n\nSolution (previous answer): I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong combinatorial principle. I thought the problem was asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, which is a classic problem in combinatorics. However, the correct approach is to use the principle of permutations, as we are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket.\n\nCorrect Answer: The number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is:\n\n10C2 = 10 x 9 = 90\n\nExplanation:\nTo count the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the principle of permutations. We are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket, so we need to choose the first orange from the basket and then choose the second orange from the remaining 9 oranges. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges is 90.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
