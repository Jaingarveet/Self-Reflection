If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?\nChoices:\n  A: 1 step/minute\n  B: 2 step/minute\n  C: 3 step/minute\n  D: 4 step/minute\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nYou are correct! The speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute.\n\nHere's how you can arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1. Convert the time taken to travel a certain distance into speed:\nSpeed = Distance / Time taken\n2. For 20 steps, the time taken is 10 minutes, so the speed is:\nSpeed = 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute\n3. For 10 steps, the time taken is 20 minutes, so the speed is:\nSpeed = 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute\n4. Now, choose the correct answer from the options:\nAnswer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\nGreat job!\n\nHere are some tips to help you solve similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Always read the question carefully and identify the key information.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller parts and analyze each part separately.\n3. Use the information given in the question to find the time taken to travel a certain distance.\n4. Convert the time taken into speed using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time taken.\n5. Choose the correct answer from the options based on the information provided in the question.\n\nKeep practicing, and you'll become a math whiz in no time!\n"
