However, the problem states that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls, which means that the ratio of falafel to pita breads is 6:2 or 3:1.\n\nSimilarly, the problem states that three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do, which means that the ratio of falafel to rolls is 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nNow, let's use this information to find the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls. We can set up the ratio as follows:\n\nNumber of pita breads = Number of rolls x Ratio of falafel to rolls\n= 2 x 3/10\n= 6/10\n\nTherefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 6/10 pita breads.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
