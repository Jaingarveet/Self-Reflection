To do this, we need to find the length of each side of the square. Let's call the length of each side \"s\".\n\nReflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by not considering the length of the diagonals of the original square. The correct formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of each side.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
