I calculated the marked price of the watch incorrectly, and I need to recalculate it.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nTo find the marked price of the watch, we need to find the profit percentage earned by the shopkeeper after giving a discount of 7%.\n\nProfit percentage = (7% - 5%) = 2%\n\nMarked price = Cost price + Profit = Rs. 697.50 + (Rs. 697.50 x 2%) = Rs. 712.50\n\nTherefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 712.50."
