I used the concept of relative speed correctly, but I misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states that the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, but I misunderstood this to mean that the plane started at a speed of 100 miles per hour, which is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\nThe distance traveled by the ship = 180 miles\nThe distance traveled by the plane = 180 miles x 10 = 1800 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 1800 miles.\n"
