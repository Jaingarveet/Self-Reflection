        "content": "  Thought: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand that the semi-circles drawn on the opposite sides of the square paper are diameters, not radii.\n\nAction: Let's use the formula for the area of a sector to find the area of the remaining paper.\n\nThe area of the sector = (θ/360) × π × r^2\n\nWhere θ is the angle subtended by the semi-circle at the center of the square, and r is the radius of the semi-circle.\n\nSince the semi-circles are diameters, the radius of each semi-circle is equal to half the side length of the square.\n\nSo, the radius of each semi-circle is 20/2 = 10 cm.\n\nθ = 360° - 180° = 180°\n\nNow, we can plug in the values and calculate the area of the remaining paper:\n\nArea = (180°/360°) × π × (10 cm)^2 = 8.75 cm^2\n\nAction: The correct answer is (C) 8.75 cm^2.\n\nExplanation: The area of the remaining paper is 8.75 cm^2, which is the area of the sector of the square that is outside of the two semi-circles."
