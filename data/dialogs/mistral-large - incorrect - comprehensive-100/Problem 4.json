We know it can travel 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700m / 40s = 17.5m/s.\nNext, we need to find how far it travels in 5 seconds. We can use the formula distance = speed x time, so the distance is 17.5m/s x 5s = 87.5m.\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this distance.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\nReflection:\nI made a mistake in my previous answer by not checking if the calculated distance was one of the available answer choices. In this case, none of the answer choices match the calculated distance, so the correct answer is \"None of the Above\". I need to be more careful in the future and make sure to check if the calculated answer is one of the available choices before selecting an answer."
