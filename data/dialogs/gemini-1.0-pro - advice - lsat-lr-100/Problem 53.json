I focused on the fact that the props and costumes were too old and fragile for use in a performance, and I concluded that the museum did not waste its money. However, I did not address the point made by Wexell, which was that the props and costumes had no artistic significance outside the context of a performance.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully consider the arguments presented and identify the specific claim that is being made and the evidence that is being offered to support it. I will also determine whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient to support the claim, and I will identify any assumptions or logical fallacies that may be present in the arguments.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
