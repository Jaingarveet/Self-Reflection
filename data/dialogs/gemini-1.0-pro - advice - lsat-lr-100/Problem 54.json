The argument assumes that the brothers' presence at the party implies their intention to attend, which is not necessarily true.\n- Option C: The argument doesn't use any intrinsically evaluative terms.\n- Option D: The argument doesn't make any claims about something being true of only some people.\n- Option E: This is irrelevant to the reasoning error in the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nThe argument treats the fact of someone's presence at a given event as a guarantee that that person had a legitimate reason to be at that event."
