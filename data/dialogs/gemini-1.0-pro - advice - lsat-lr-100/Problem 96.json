I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Problem:** I initially chose answer choice B, which stated that highways with the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic. This was incorrect because the study stated that highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.\n* **Solution:** I need to carefully analyze the information provided in the context and the answer choices to identify the one that best explains the phenomenon described.\n* **Correct answer:** The correct answer is **C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.** This is because commuters are typically more focused and cautious drivers, as they are familiar with their routes and are less likely to engage in risky behaviors such as speeding or distracted driving.\n**Answer:**\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
