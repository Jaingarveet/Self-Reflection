This is because the argument claims that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. If it were possible to understand sentences as uninterrupted streams of sound, then the argument's conclusion would not follow.\n**Lessons learned:**\n* Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.\n* Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.\n* Be aware of common fallacies and logical errors.\n* Evaluate the argument as a whole, not just individual parts.\n**Applying the lessons learned to the current question:**\nThe current question asks which assumption the argument depends on. The argument claims that native speakers perceive sentences as sequences of separate words, but this is an illusion. This illusion is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. The only answer choice that captures this assumption is A: \"It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.\"\nTherefore, the correct answer is A."
