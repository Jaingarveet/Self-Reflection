The removal of these hormones could be due to other factors, not necessarily crying itself.\n**Key takeaway:** Pay close attention to the argument's structure and identify the specific point being made. Don't get sidetracked by additional information or potential alternative explanations. \n## Applying the Lesson to the Current Question:\n**Thought process:**\n1. The argument claims that crying reduces emotional stress because tears contain stress hormones.\n2. This reasoning assumes that the presence of these hormones in tears is the cause of their removal from the body.\n3. However, other factors could be responsible for the removal of these hormones, such as the body's natural filtering processes.\n4. Therefore, the argument fails to establish a clear causal link between crying and stress reduction.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
