Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the key facts and assumptions in the information provided.\n - Always consider all possible interpretations of the information provided.\n - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the information provided.\n - Never draw conclusions that are not supported by the information provided.\n - Always choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information provided.\n"

I focused on the change in air replenishment rate without considering the impact on carbon dioxide levels and airborne illnesses.\nThought process:\n* The passage states that less frequent air replenishment leads to higher carbon dioxide levels and easier spread of airborne illnesses.\n* The change in 1985 increased the interval between air replenishment, implying a potential increase in carbon dioxide and risk of illness.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n(People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.) \nThis answer is most strongly supported by the information provided, as it directly relates to the increased risk of illness due to the change in air replenishment. \n"
