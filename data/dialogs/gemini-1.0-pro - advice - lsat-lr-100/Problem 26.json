        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Be mindful of the context in which information is presented.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not supported by evidence.\n- Consider alternative explanations and interpretations of the information provided.\n- Choose the answer that most accurately reflects the information presented, even if it is not the most obvious or intuitive choice.\n"

I focused on the general features of horror stories, rather than on the specific features that were mentioned in the passage. As a result, I chose an answer that was not supported by the evidence.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully consider the context of the question and the information that is provided in the passage. I will also be mindful of the specific features of horror stories that are mentioned in the passage, such as the violation of the laws of nature and the intention to produce dread in the reader.\nBased on my self-reflection, I believe that the correct answer to the question is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. This answer is supported by the passage, which states that \"both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\" The passage also mentions that \"in some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.\" This suggests that some horror stories that employ symbolism may also describe violations of the laws of nature.\nI am confident that this answer is correct because it is consistent with the information that is provided in the passage and it takes into account the specific features of horror stories that are mentioned."
