Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Actively listen to and engage with the opponent's arguments.\n- Deconstruct complex arguments into their core components.\n- Prioritize direct counter-arguments over tangential ones.\n- Consider the broader context and how it might influence the relative strength of arguments.\n- Choose your counter-arguments strategically, aiming to maximize their impact while maintaining logical consistency.\n"

By stating that ninjas were trained to walk silently on such floors, Patricia effectively undermines the argument that ninjas posed a serious threat to wealthy Japanese households.\n* **Logical Consistency:** Answer B aligns with the established fact that ninjas were highly skilled and trained in stealth.\n* **Impact:** This counter-argument directly addresses the point of contention and weakens Tamara's argument considerably.\n**Comparison with Other Choices:**\n* A: This is irrelevant as it focuses on the actions of the poor, not the wealthy, who are the subject of Tamara's claim.\n* C: While true, this does not directly counter Tamara's argument about the prevalence of squeaky floors among the wealthy.\n* D: This is tangential and does not address the specific issue of ninja activity during the Tokugawa period.\n* E: This is irrelevant as the question focuses on the Tokugawa period specifically.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\") \n"
