Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?\nChoices:\n  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.\n  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\n  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

The correct answer was **[REDACTED]**, which ensures that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses by placing either the toy store or the veterinarian between them.\n## Applying the Learning:\nFollowing the logic of the correct answer from before, I need to find an option that similarly guarantees the separation of the restaurants by at least two businesses.\n### Analyzing Choices:\n*   **A**: This option only restricts one restaurant's location, not guaranteeing the separation.\n*   **B**: This option relates restaurants to the optometrist or veterinarian, not ensuring separation.\n*   **C**: This option mirrors the correct answer from before, ensuring separation by placing the toy store or veterinarian between the restaurants.\n*   **D**: This option restricts the distance between the pharmacy and a restaurant, not addressing the separation between the two restaurants.\n*   **E**: This option concerns the optometrist and shoe store, not the separation of the restaurants.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the option that has the same effect as the original constraint is:\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
