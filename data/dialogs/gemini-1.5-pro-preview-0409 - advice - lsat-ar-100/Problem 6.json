Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I focused too much on the individual relationships between reviewers and not enough on the overall structure of who reviewed which plays. This led me to a conclusion that wasn't fully supported by the given information.\n## Deductions from the Context:\n* **Two reviewers have identical reviews:** This is a crucial point to focus on. \n* **Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian:** This means Megregian reviews either 2 or 3 plays.\n* **Neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews:** This separates Jiang's reviews from Lopez and Megregian.\n* **Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane:** This means they share at least one play.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Megregian's Reviews:** Since Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and they don't share any plays with Jiang, the two reviewers with identical reviews must be Kramer and O'Neill. This means they both review the same 2 plays (Tamerlane and one other).\n2. **Jiang's Reviews:** Jiang's reviews are separate, so they must review 2 plays (the remaining play not reviewed by Kramer and O'Neill, plus one more).\n3. **Lopez's Reviews:** Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so they must review only 1 play (the remaining play not reviewed by the others).\n## Conclusion:\nBased on this analysis, we know:\n* **Megregian reviews 2 plays.**\n* **Jiang reviews 2 plays.**\n* **O'Neill reviews 2 plays.**\nTherefore, the only option that MUST be true is: \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** (Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does) \n"
