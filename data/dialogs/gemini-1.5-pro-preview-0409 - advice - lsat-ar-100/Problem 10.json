However, it includes both French plays AND the Russian play, violating the condition \"If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\" So, **A is not valid**.\n* **B:** Similar to A, this option violates the condition regarding French plays and the Russian play. So, **B is not valid**.\n* **C:** This option has 4 French works (2 novels + 2 plays), exceeding the limit of \"no more than four French works.\" So, **C is not valid**.\n* **D:** This option has 5 French works (3 novels + 2 plays), again exceeding the limit. So, **D is not valid**.\n* **E:** This option has 4 French works (3 novels + 1 play), which is within the limit. It also has 3 novels, fulfilling the novel requirement. It has more French novels than Russian novels and doesn't violate the French play/Russian play condition. Therefore, **E satisfies all conditions**.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
