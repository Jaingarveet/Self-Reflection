Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely made an error in interpreting the constraints and their implications on the possible parking space assignments for each employee.  I need to carefully analyze each rule and consider how they interact to limit the options for each person.\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Robertson:** Must be in spaces #1-4 and above Young. This leaves only two options: **#3 or #4**.\n2. **Young:** Must be above Togowa and below Robertson. Since Robertson is limited to #3 or #4, Young can only be in **#2** (if Robertson is in #4) or **#3** (if Robertson is in #3).\n3. **Togowa:** Must be below Young. So, Togowa can only be in **#1** (if Young is in #2) or **#2** (if Young is in #3).\n4. **Xu:** Must be above Souza. This leaves several possibilities for both Xu and Souza depending on the remaining spaces.\n5. **Souza:** Must be below Xu. Similar to Xu, multiple possibilities exist depending on the remaining spaces.\n6. **Vaughn:**  Has no specific constraints, so their space will be determined by the remaining options after placing the others.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, **three employees (Robertson, Young, and Togowa) have only two possible parking space assignments each**. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
