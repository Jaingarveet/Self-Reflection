The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

This led me to a wrong conclusion.\n## Applying the Learnings:\n1. **Start with the definite information:** We know for sure that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This immediately eliminates options A and E.\n2. **Consider the remaining options:** \n    * **Option C:** If Lopez also reviewed Tamerlane, then three students would have reviewed the same play, violating the \"exactly two\" constraint. So, option C is out.\n    * **Option D:** If Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, then they would have reviewed the same play as Kramer and O'Neill, again violating the \"exactly two\" constraint. So, option D is also out.\nTherefore, the only remaining option that satisfies all conditions is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
