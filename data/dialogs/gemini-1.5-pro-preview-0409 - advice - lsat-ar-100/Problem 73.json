Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Two others could review Undulation, and Megregian could share reviews with one other person for the remaining plays.\n* **B: O'Neill does not review Undulation:** This is also possible. Similar to option A, two others could review Undulation, and O'Neill could share reviews with one other person for the remaining plays.\n* **C: Jiang reviews Undulation:** This is **NOT possible**. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can (due to the constraint). This leaves only two reviewers for Undulation, contradicting the given information. \n* **D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane:** This is possible. Lopez could review Tamerlane and Undulation, sharing these reviews with one other person.\n* **E: O'Neill reviews Sunset:** This is possible. O'Neill could review Sunset and Tamerlane, sharing these reviews with one other person (Kramer).\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT possible is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
