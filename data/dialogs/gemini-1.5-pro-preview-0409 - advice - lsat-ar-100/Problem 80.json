Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

This led to overlooking conflicts and inconsistencies between assignments and the given rules. \n## Approach for this Attempt:\n1. **Analyze each option systematically:** I will evaluate each choice against all the given rules to ensure no contradictions exist.\n2. **Prioritize interconnected rules:**  I will pay close attention to rules that influence the placement of multiple employees, such as the order of Young, Togowa, and Robertson.\n3. **Eliminate options with conflicts:**  If any rule is violated within an option, I will immediately discard it.\n## Applying the Approach:\n* **Option A:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. (Eliminated)\n* **Option B:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. (Eliminated)\n* **Option C:** Violates the rule that Xu must have a higher-numbered space than Souza. (Eliminated)\n* **Option D:**  Satisfies all given rules:\n    * Young has a higher-numbered space than Togowa.\n    * Xu has a higher-numbered space than Souza.\n    * Robertson has a higher-numbered space than Young and is assigned #2 (within the range of #1-4).\n* **Option E:** Violates the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young. (Eliminated)\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the only option that satisfies all the given rules is D. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
