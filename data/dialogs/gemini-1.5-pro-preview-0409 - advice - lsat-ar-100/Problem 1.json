It's crucial to systematically analyze each option against the given conditions to pinpoint the impossible scenario. \n## Answering the Question:\n**Analysis of Options:**\n* **A:**  If Franco is alone on Monday, this leaves Tuesday and Wednesday with two witnesses each, satisfying the conditions. \n* **B:**  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco being with him would contradict the condition of only two witnesses on Tuesday. \n* **C:**  This satisfies the condition of two witnesses on Tuesday and doesn't contradict any other condition.\n* **D:** Garcia on Monday and Hong with Iturbe on Wednesday leaves only one witness for Tuesday, violating the condition.\n* **E:**  Jackson on Tuesday and two witnesses on Monday leaves Wednesday with only Iturbe, fulfilling all conditions.\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A, C, and E all comply with the conditions. Options B and D directly contradict the given information. Therefore, the scenario that CANNOT be true is:\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
