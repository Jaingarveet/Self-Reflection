Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the given rules.\n## Applying the Learning:\nThis time, I will focus on the order imposed by the rules rather than specific parking space numbers. \n**Rule Analysis:**\n1. **Young > Togowa:** Young must have a higher number than Togowa.\n2. **Xu > Souza:** Xu must have a higher number than Souza.\n3. **Robertson > Young:** Robertson must have a higher number than Young.\n4. **Robertson:** Must be in space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n**Given:** Robertson is in space #3.\n**Deductions:**\n* From rule 3, **Young must be in space #1 or #2** (lower than Robertson's #3).\n* From rule 1, **Togowa must be in space #1** (lower than Young). \n* We don't have enough information to determine the exact positions of Souza, Xu, and Vaughn, only that they must be in spaces #4, #5, and #6 in some order.\nTherefore, the only option that **must be true** is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** (Togowa is assigned parking space #2) \n"
