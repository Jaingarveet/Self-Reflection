The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I focused too much on the constraint that exactly two students review the same plays, leading me to a wrong conclusion. I should have analyzed each condition more systematically and considered all possibilities before reaching an answer.\n## Answering the Question:\n**Given:**\n* Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane.\n* Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.\n* Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.\n* Lopez and Megregian don't review the same plays as Jiang.\n* Exactly two students review the same plays.\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Jiang's Plays:** Since Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane and cannot share plays with Lopez or Megregian, Jiang must review **Sunset and Undulation**.\n2. **Kramer and O'Neill:** They both review Tamerlane and cannot share plays with Jiang. So, one of them must review Sunset and the other Undulation. This fulfills the condition of exactly two students sharing the same plays.\n3. **Lopez and Megregian:** They cannot review the same plays as Jiang (Sunset and Undulation) and Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez. Therefore, **Megregian must review Tamerlane and one of the other plays (Sunset or Undulation)**. \n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the only option that must be true is **D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.** \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
