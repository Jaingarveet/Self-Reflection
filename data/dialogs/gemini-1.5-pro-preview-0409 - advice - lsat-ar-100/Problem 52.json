This led me to a wrong conclusion.\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Iturbe and Jackson testify on Wednesday:** This leaves Monday and Tuesday for the remaining three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong).\n2. **Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday:** This means only one witness can testify on Monday.\n3. **Hong does not testify on Monday:** Since only one witness testifies on Monday, and it can't be Hong, it must be either Franco or Garcia. \n4. **Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia:** This condition is automatically satisfied as they cannot both be on Monday (only one witness on Monday) and they are not together on Wednesday.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is that exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday (either Franco or Garcia).\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
