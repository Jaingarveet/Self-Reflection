Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n\nThought:\nIf Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 3. That means Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
