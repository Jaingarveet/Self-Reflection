Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\n\nThought:\nIf P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. \nIf M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. \nIf more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. \nF and K cannot both be selected. \nK and M cannot both be selected. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nIf L is selected as a chemist, then either F or H must be selected as a botanist. If F is selected, then K cannot be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

If K and M cannot both be selected, then F cannot be selected. \nStatement E is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then both K and L can still be selected. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.\n2. Consider all possible scenarios and conditions.\n3. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.\n4. Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.\n5.
