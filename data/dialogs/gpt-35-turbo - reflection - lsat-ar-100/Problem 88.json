At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nThought:\nWe know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F is also on the middle shelf. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that at least three books are on the bottom shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other if and only if they are both on the bottom shelf. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

However, the question only states that F and M are on the same shelf, not necessarily the middle shelf. \nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misreading the question\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nWe know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and M could be on any shelf together. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that at least three books are on the bottom shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
