Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n\nThought:\nIf Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. \nExactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because Hong does not testify on Monday. \nFranco cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness testifies on Monday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. \nTherefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") - Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
