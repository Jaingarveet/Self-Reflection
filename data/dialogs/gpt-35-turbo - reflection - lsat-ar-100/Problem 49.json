Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n\nThought:\nThe pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\nThe pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
