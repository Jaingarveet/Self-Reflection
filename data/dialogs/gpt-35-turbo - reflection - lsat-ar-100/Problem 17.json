The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?\nChoices:\n  A: day 1 and day 3\n  B: day 2 and day 6\n  C: day 3 and day 5\n  D: day 4 and day 6\n  E: day 5 and day 7\n\nThought:\nIf Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.\nRottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.\nGreyhounds are featured on day 1.\nNo breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all of the restrictions.\n2. Identify the days that each breed can be featured based on the given restrictions.\n3. Use the restrictions to eliminate the pairs of days that cannot feature the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.\n4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that you have considered all of the restrictions.\n5. Choose the answer that violates one or more of the restrictions.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all of the restrictions.\n - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that you have considered all of the restrictions.\n - Always eliminate answer choices that violate one or more of the restrictions.\n - Remember to consider all of the restrictions, even if they seem redundant or unnecessary."
