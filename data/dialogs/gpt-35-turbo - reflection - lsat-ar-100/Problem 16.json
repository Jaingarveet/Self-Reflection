Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?\nChoices:\n  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia\n  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca\n  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa\n  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan\n  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin\n\nThought:\n- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n- There are six lab assistants and six lab sessions, so each assistant will lead one session in the morning and one in the afternoon.\n- Based on the constraints, we can eliminate some options.\n- Option A violates the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n- Option B violates the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n- Option C violates the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n- Option D satisfies all the constraints.\n- Option E violates the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
