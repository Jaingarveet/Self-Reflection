Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a possible assignment of riders to bicycles, with the riders for each bicycle listed in the order in which they test the bicycle?\nChoices:\n  A: F: Seamus, Reynaldo; G: Yuki, Seamus; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n  B: F: Seamus, Yuki; G: Reynaldo, Theresa; H: Yuki, Seamus; J: Theresa, Reynaldo\n  C: F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Seamus, Reynaldo; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n  D: F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Theresa, Reynaldo; H: Reynaldo, Theresa; J: Seamus, Yuki\n  E: F: Yuki, Theresa; G: Seamus, Yuki; H: Theresa, Reynaldo; J: Reynaldo, Seamus\n\nThought:\nWe know that Reynaldo cannot test F, and Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Yuki cannot test J, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. \nOption A: Seamus tests F, which is not possible as Reynaldo cannot test F. \nOption B: Theresa tests H, which is a valid condition. Yuki tests G on the first day, which means Seamus must test G on the second day. Reynaldo tests J on the second day, which is valid as Yuki cannot test J. \nOption C: Yuki tests F, which is not possible as Yuki cannot test J. \nOption D: Reynaldo tests H, which is not possible as Theresa must be one of the testers for H. \nOption E: Theresa tests H, which is a valid condition. Yuki tests F on the first day, which means Seamus must test F on the second day.
