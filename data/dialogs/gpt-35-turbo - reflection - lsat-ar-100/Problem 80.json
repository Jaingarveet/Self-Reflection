Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\n\nThought:\nRobertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nTherefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\nTherefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nTherefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\nFrom the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.\nOption A violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nOption B violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\nOption C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nOption E violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.\n3. Identify the constraints on the assignment of parking spaces.\n4. Analyze each option and eliminate the ones that violate the rules or constraints.\n5.
