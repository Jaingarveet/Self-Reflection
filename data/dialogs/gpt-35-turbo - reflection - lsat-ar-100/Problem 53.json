The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown in the evening.\n  B: L is shown in the afternoon.\n  C: L is shown in the evening.\n  D: M is shown in the morning.\n  E: M is shown in the afternoon.\n\nThought:\nJ is shown in the evening, so J is the sixth or seventh house.\nK cannot be shown in the morning, so K is the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.\nL must be shown after K and before M, so L is the fourth or fifth house.\nM is the fifth, sixth, or seventh house.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
