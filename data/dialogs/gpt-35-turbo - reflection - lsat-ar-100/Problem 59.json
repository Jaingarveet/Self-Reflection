Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: P CANNOT be performed\nChoices:\n  A: second\n  B: third\n  C: fourth\n  D: sixth\n  E: seventh\n\nThought:\nWe know that P is performed before S, and we need to find the position where P cannot be performed.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \nExplanation: \nIf P is performed second, then S must be performed after P, which violates the given condition that P is performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed second.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

I only focused on the condition that P is performed before S and did not consider the other conditions. \nError Keywords:\n - Ignored conditions\n - Misunderstood problem\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nWe know that P is performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the second, third, fourth, or sixth position because S is performed after P. If P is performed in the seventh position, then S must be performed in the eighth position, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the seventh position. The only remaining option is the fifth position, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the fifth position.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify all the given conditions and constraints.\n3. Consider all the given conditions and constraints while solving the problem.\n4. Use logical reasoning to eliminate the positions where P cannot be performed.\n5. Choose the position where P cannot be performed based on the given conditions.\n6.
