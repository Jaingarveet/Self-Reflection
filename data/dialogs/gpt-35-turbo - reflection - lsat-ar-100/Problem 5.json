Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n\nThought:\nFrom the given conditions, we know that:\n- More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n- I is placed on the middle shelf.\n- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n- F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nOption A is not necessarily true because O could be on the same shelf as M, which is not the top shelf.\nOption B is not necessarily true because G could be on the same shelf as K, which is not the top shelf.\nOption C is not necessarily true because F could be on the same shelf as I, which is not the top shelf.\nOption D is not necessarily true because O could be on the same shelf as M, which is not the top shelf.\nOption E must be true because we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and L cannot be on the same shelf, and F must be on a higher shelf than L.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
