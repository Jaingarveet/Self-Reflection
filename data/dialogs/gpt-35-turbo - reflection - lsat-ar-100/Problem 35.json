        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\n\nThought:\nWe need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.\nFrom the given conditions, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the third batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. Also, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This leaves only Monday and Wednesday for the remaining batches.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \nIf one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it is possible that exactly one batch of cookies is not made on Monday. Therefore, statement C could be false.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
