Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n\nThought:\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 according to the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. \nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. \nTogowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. \nSouza and Vaughn must be assigned parking spaces #1 and #6, but it is not clear which one is assigned to which space.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nMy mistake was in misinterpreting the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. I assumed that Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson, but the rule only requires that Young be assigned a parking space with a higher number than Togowa. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of rules\n - Misunderstanding of requirements\n - Incorrect assumption\nSolution:\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 according to the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. \nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. \nTogowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. \nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #2. \nTherefore, Young must be assigned parking space #5, and the correct answer is E.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.\n3. Identify the parking space assigned to Robertson.\n4. Use the rules to determine the parking spaces assigned to the other employees.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the rules and requirements that govern the problem.\n - Always double-check your assumptions and reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that misinterpreting the rules can lead to incorrect answers."
