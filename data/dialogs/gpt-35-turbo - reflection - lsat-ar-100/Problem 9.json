Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n\nThought:\nRobertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

However, the question stem only states that if Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true. Therefore, Souza could be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. \nError Keywords:\n - Misreading the question stem\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misinterpretation of the rules\nSolution:\nRobertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nIf Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, A could be true.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question stem carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.\n3. Identify any constraints or limitations on the assignment of parking spaces.\n4. Consider all possible scenarios based on the given rules and constraints.\n5.
