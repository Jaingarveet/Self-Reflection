Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Manx are featured on day 3.\n  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.\n  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.\n  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.\n\nThought:\nIf Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they must be featured on days 4, 5, and 6.\nRottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nGreyhounds are featured on day 1.\nNo breed is featured on any two consecutive days.\nTherefore, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 3.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

However, this is not necessarily true. Himalayans could be featured on any three days other than day 1 and day 2. Therefore, Rottweilers could be featured on day 5, which means that choice C could be true.
