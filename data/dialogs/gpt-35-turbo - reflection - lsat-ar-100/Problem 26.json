        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\n\nThought:\nWe know that the third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Also, no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. Therefore, Wayne must perform at least one modern piece before the third solo. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \nWayne must perform at least one modern piece before the third solo, and exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Therefore, Wayne must perform a traditional piece in the second or fifth solo. Thus, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is two.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
