Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nThought:\nIf Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports.\nGeorge can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.\nNeither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

Read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions.\n2. Consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.\n3. Make a list of all the students who must give reports and on which days.\n4. Consider the different possibilities for when George can give his report.\n5.
