The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.\n  B: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.\n  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.\n  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.\n\nThought:\nIf Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.\nGreyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on days 2, 3, or 4.\nRottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they cannot be featured on days 6 or 7.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

The question only states that Himalayans are not featured on day 1 or day 7. \nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misreading the question\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nIf Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.\nGreyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on days 2, 3, or 4.\nRottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\nNewfoundlands can be featured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\nBased on these conditions, the only option that could be true is that Rottweilers are featured only on day 3 (option D).\nInstructions:\n1.
