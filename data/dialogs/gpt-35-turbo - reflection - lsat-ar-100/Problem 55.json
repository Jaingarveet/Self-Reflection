Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable schedule of witnesses?\nChoices:\n  A: Monday: Franco Tuesday: Hong and Iturbe Wednesday: Garcia and Jackson\n  B: Monday: Franco and Hong Tuesday: Iturbe and Jackson Wednesday: Garcia\n  C: Monday: Garcia Tuesday: Franco and Iturbe Wednesday: Hong and Jackson\n  D: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Franco and Hong Wednesday: Iturbe\n  E: Monday: Garcia and Jackson Tuesday: Hong Wednesday: Franco and Iturbe\n\nThought:\n- Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.\n- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n- Hong does not testify on Monday.\n- At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n- There are five witnesses in total.\n- The schedule must take exactly three days of one week.\n- Based on the above conditions, we can eliminate some of the choices.\n- Choice A is not possible because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but Franco testifies on Wednesday in this schedule.\n- Choice C is not possible because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but Iturbe testifies on Tuesday in this schedule.\n- Choice D is not possible because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but there is no witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday in this schedule.\n- Choice E is not possible because there are three witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday, but only two witnesses can testify on Tuesday.\n- Therefore, the correct answer is either A or B.\n- We need to check if the remaining conditions are met in both schedules.\n- In choice A, Franco testifies on Monday, Hong testifies on Tuesday, and Garcia testifies on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions.\n- In choice B, Franco and Hong testify on Monday, Iturbe and Jackson testify on Tuesday, and Garcia testifies on Wednesday.
