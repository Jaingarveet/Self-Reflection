Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n\nThought:\nRobertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. So, Robertson has only four possible parking spaces.\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. So, Young has only two possible parking spaces (#5 or #6) and Togowa has only two possible parking spaces (#1 or #2).\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
