Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?\nChoices:\n  A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  B: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\n  C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\n  D: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  E: oatmeal: Monday, Thursday, Friday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n\nThought:\n- The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n- The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n- No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n- At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n- There are three batches of each kind of cookie.\n- Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Read the question carefully and pay close attention to all of the given conditions.\n2. Use logic to determine the possible days on which each batch of cookies could be made.\n3. Eliminate answer choices that do not meet all of the given conditions.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure that it meets all of the given conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that meets all of the given conditions.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and pay close attention to all of the given conditions.\n - Use logic to determine the possible solutions.\n - Eliminate answer choices that do not meet all of the given conditions.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure that it meets all of the given conditions.\n - Be careful not to misread or misinterpret the question."
