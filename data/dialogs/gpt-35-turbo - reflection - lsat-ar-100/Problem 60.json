The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order in which the breeds of kitten are featured in the pet shop, from day 1 though day 7?\nChoices:\n  A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese\n  B: Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx Himalayan, Manx\n  C: Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese\n  D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Siamese, Himalayan\n  E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan\n\nThought:\nWe know that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or days 3, 4, and 5.\nRottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 4, and 6 or days 1, 3, and 5.\nGreyhounds are featured on day 1. Therefore, Greyhounds cannot be featured on days 2 or 3.\nNo breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
