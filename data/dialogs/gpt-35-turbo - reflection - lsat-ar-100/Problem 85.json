Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: In the order in which the articles are edited, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: first\n  B: third\n  C: fourth\n  D: fifth\n  E: sixth\n\nThought:\nS must be earlier than Y, so Y must be last.\nJ must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J, G, and R must be consecutive and in that order.\nQ must be third if S is earlier than Q.\nThere are two possible orders for the finance articles: JGR or RGJ.\nIf S is first, then Q must be third, which means the order of the nutrition articles is SQYRJGR or SQYRGJR.\nIf S is third, then Q must be sixth, which means the order of the nutrition articles is YRJGQS or RGJYSQ.\nIf S is fourth, then Q must be third, which means the order of the nutrition articles is SQYRJG or SQYRGJ.\nIf S is fifth, then Q must be sixth, which means the order of the nutrition articles is YRJGSQ or RGJYSQ.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - S can be in the third position only if Q is third.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
