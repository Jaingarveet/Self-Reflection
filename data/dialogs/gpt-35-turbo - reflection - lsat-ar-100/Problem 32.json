Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\n\nThought:\nIf none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.\nIf Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.\nIf Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") because it contradicts the previous conclusion that Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. I thought that Solide's website target must be 1 day, but it could be 2 days if Truvest's website target is also 2 days. Therefore, option B is not necessarily true. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - False conclusion\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nIf none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.\nIf Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.\nIf Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the conditions and constraints given in the problem.\n3. Make a list of the six targets for each client and their possible values.\n4. Use the conditions to eliminate the impossible values for each target.\n5. Use the constraints to deduce the possible values for each target.\n6. Check each option against the conditions and constraints to see if it is necessarily true or false.\n7. Eliminate the options that are necessarily true and choose the option that is not necessarily true.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the conditions and constraints given in the problem.\n - Always make a list of the variables and their possible values.\n - Always use the conditions to eliminate the impossible values for each variable.\n - Always use the constraints to deduce the possible values for each variable.\n - Always check each option against the conditions and constraints to see if it is necessarily true or false.\n - Remember that not necessarily true means that it could be true or false, while necessarily true means that it must be true."
