Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\n\nThought:\nIf the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 3.\nThe pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 4, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
