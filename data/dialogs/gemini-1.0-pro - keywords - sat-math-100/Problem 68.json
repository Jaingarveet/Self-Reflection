I incorrectly multiplied both sides of the equation by $100$ instead of dividing by $0.18$.\n**Correct Solution:**\n1. Divide both sides of the equation by $0.18$:\n$$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$\n$$0.5556x + 1.1111y = x + y$$\n2. Simplify the equation:\n$$0.5556x = -0.1111y$$\n3. Solve for $x$:\n$$x = -\\frac{0.1111y}{0.5556}$$\n$$x = -0.2y$$\n4. Substitute $y = 100$ into the equation:\n$$x = -0.2(100)$$\n$$x = -20$$\n**Conclusion:**\nClayton must use $-20$ milliliters of the $10\\%$ by mass saline solution. However, this answer is not possible as it represents a negative volume. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.\n**Action:** Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
