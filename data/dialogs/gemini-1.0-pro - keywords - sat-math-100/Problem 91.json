I will carefully analyze the problem and my previous solution to ensure I provide the correct answer this time.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I made a mistake in calculating the slope of the linear function.\n* **Solution:** I will double-check my calculations and ensure I use the correct formula for slope: (change in y) / (change in x).\n* **Linear function analysis:** I will carefully examine the table of values to identify the pattern and determine the equation that best represents the relationship between n and f(n).\n**Analysis:**\nLooking at the table, we can see that the values of f(n) increase by 3 for every increase of 1 in n. This indicates a constant slope of 3.\n**Answer:**\nThe equation that defines the linear function with a slope of 3 and a y-intercept of -5 is:\n**f(n) = 3n - 5**\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C: f(n) = 3n - 5**."
