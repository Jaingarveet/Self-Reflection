I incorrectly identified the slope as 40 and the y-intercept as 21, when in fact the slope is 21 and the y-intercept is 40. This led me to choose the wrong answer, which was $y=40+21$.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully identify the slope and y-intercept of the equation before solving. I will also double-check my work to ensure that I have not made any errors.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
