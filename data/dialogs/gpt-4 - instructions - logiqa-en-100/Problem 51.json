According to condition (3), if X is in the production department, W cannot be in the production department. But there is no restriction on W being in the public relations department. Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is \"G is assigned to the sales department\" because F and G cannot be in the same department and since F is in the production department, the only other departments for G are sales and public relations. But since we need to assign three people to the sales department and three to the production department, if G is in sales, we would have four people in sales (G, H, Y, and another person because H and Y must be together), which is not allowed.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
