Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n2. Identify the opinion that is being questioned.\n3. Evaluate each statement to determine whether it supports or challenges this opinion.\n4. Look for statements that attribute the cause of the problem to something other than what is stated in the opinion.\n5. Choose the answer that does not challenge the opinion.\n"

This opinion can be challenged by any evidence that suggests human activity, rather than natural causes, is responsible for the storms. \nA: This statement suggests that the grassland has degraded over time, but it does not specify the cause. It neither supports nor challenges the opinion.\nB: This statement suggests that the grassland on the Mongolian side is in better condition than the grassland on the Chinese side. This could imply that human activity, rather than climate, is responsible for the degradation, which challenges the opinion.\nC: This statement suggests that in areas without human activity, the grassland has not degraded. This implies that human activity, rather than climate, is responsible for the degradation, which challenges the opinion.\nD: This statement directly attributes the increase in dust storms to human factors, which challenges the opinion.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
