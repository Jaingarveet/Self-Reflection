This is based on the information that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. \nThe assumption that does not necessarily make the inference hold is the one that does not establish a clear relationship between Zhang Shan, Li Si, Wang Wu, and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses. \nA: Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's. This assumption does not contradict the inference. If Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, and Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's, then Zhang Shan's bonus could still be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.\nB: Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. This assumption supports the inference. If Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, and Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's, then Zhang Shan's bonus is definitely higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.\nC: Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's. This assumption contradicts the inference.
