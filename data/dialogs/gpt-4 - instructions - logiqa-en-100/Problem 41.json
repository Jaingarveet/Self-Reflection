It also says that if it can increase productivity by 10%, it can achieve a 20% increase. This means that if Green Island can achieve a 10% increase, it can avoid bankruptcy and potentially achieve a 20% increase. However, it does not necessarily mean that if it cannot achieve a 20% increase, it will go bankrupt. It only needs a 10% increase to avoid bankruptcy. Therefore, the statement that must be true is that if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt, because a 20% increase is more than the necessary 10% increase.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
