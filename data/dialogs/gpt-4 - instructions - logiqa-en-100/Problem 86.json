This means that the order of these three stations from west to east is Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao. We also know that Jiushang Station is east of Haoyun Station and adjacent to it, so Jiushang must be between Haoyun and Fuyi. Finally, Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station, so Yinling must be east of Jiushang and west of Fuyi. Therefore, the final order from west to east is Haoyun, Jiushang, Yinling, Fuyi, Huyao.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
