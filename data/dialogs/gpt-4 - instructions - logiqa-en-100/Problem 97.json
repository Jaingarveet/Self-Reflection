To weaken this argument, we need to find an alternative explanation for the increase in negative posts. \nA: This is a proverb that suggests bad news spreads faster than good news. It doesn't provide an alternative explanation for the increase in negative posts.\nB: If the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, it could explain the increase in negative posts without necessarily indicating a deteriorating social atmosphere. More users could simply mean more posts overall, both positive and negative.\nC: This suggests that some people are spreading rumors for profit, but it doesn't explain the overall increase in negative posts.\nD: The legality of the forum is irrelevant to the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
