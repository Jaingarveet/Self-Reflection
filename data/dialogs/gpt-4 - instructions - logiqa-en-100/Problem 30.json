Since a maximum of 2 people are selected, and if E is selected then A and B are also selected, it means E cannot be selected because that would mean 3 people (E, A, and B) are selected which violates condition 3. Therefore, A and B also cannot be selected because they are only selected if E is selected. \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
