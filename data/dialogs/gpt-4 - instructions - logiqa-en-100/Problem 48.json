To counter this argument, we need to find a choice that provides a different reason for the increase in Chinese buyers of US real estate.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \nReasoning: \nChoice D suggests that the increase in Chinese buyers of US real estate could be due to the low risk and potential for value preservation and appreciation of the US real estate market, not necessarily because more wealthy Chinese people are transferring their property abroad. This directly counters the claim made in the argument."
