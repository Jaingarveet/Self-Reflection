At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the views of each person.\n2. Identify the method used by one person to refute the other's views.\n3. Determine whether the refutation is based on pointing out ambiguity, lack of persuasion, contradiction, disagreement with conclusion, or agreement with conclusion but with a different explanation.\n4. Choose the answer that best describes the refutation method.\n"

Xiao Wang refutes this by explaining that people normally don't observe comets far from the sun and that the flickering light was discovered through careful tracking observation. Xiao Wang does not point out any ambiguity, contradiction, or lack of persuasion in Xiao Chen's argument.
