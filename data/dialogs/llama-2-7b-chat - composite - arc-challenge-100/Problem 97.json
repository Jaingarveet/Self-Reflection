Erosion involves the removal of rocks and minerals from their original location through natural processes such as wind, water, or ice. These particles are then transported to a new location, where they are deposited, compacted, and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the process that involves the removal of rocks and minerals from their original location.\n2. Name the process that is the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks.\n3. Explain why the process you identified is the correct answer.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Break down complex questions into smaller, manageable parts.\n* Use keywords from the question to help guide your answer.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is [REDACTED], not [REDACTED].\n"

However, the correct answer is deposition. Deposition involves the settling of sediment or particles in a new location, which is the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Erosion\n* Deposition\n* Compaction\n* Cementation\n\nSolution:\nThe first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is deposition. This process involves the settling of sediment or particles in a new location, such as a river delta or ocean floor. The sediment is then compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the process that involves the settling of sediment or particles in a new location.\n2.
