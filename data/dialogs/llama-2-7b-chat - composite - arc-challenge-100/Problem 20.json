New seasons occur every 3 months, as the Earth takes approximately 3 months to complete one orbit around the Sun. This is because the Earth's axis tilts at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees, causing the seasons to change as the planet moves through its orbit.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Season\n* Orbit\n* Sun\n\nSolution:\n\n1.
