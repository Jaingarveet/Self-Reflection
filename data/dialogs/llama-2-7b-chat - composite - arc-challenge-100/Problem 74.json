However, upon further reflection, I realized that thermal energy is actually a type of kinetic energy, as it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance.\n\nQuestion: What is the correct type of energy for each option?\n\nA: Sound energy is a type of kinetic energy.\nB: Radiant energy is a type of potential energy.\nC: Chemical energy is a type of potential energy.\nD: Thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is (D) Thermal energy is a type of kinetic energy.\n\nExplanation: Thermal energy is the energy of motion of particles in a substance, making it a type of kinetic energy. The other options are not types of energy that can be classified as potential or kinetic: sound energy is a type of kinetic energy, radiant energy is a type of potential energy, and chemical energy is a type of potential energy."
