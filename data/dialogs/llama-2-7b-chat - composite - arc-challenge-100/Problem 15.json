In the case of the snack, each ingredient (peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces) retains its original properties, such as taste, texture, and chemical composition, even when mixed together. Therefore, the snack is a mixture.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Mixture\n* Substance\n* Composition\n* Properties\n\nSolution:\nThe snack is a mixture because the ingredients are not chemically combined and retain their original properties.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
