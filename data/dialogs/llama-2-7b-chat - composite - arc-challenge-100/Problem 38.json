Which of the following has the lowest mass?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake now. Here's my reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the volume of the bricks instead of their mass.\n* I calculated the volume of the bricks incorrectly by using the wrong unit (m^3 instead of kg).\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is (C) 6000 m^3 of air.\n\nExplanation:\nThe density of air is 1 kg/m^3, so the mass of 6000 m^3 of air is 6000 kg.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving problems involving density and mass, it's important to use the correct units and to carefully read the question to avoid misunderstandings. In this case, I should have used kg instead of m^3 when calculating the mass of the air."
