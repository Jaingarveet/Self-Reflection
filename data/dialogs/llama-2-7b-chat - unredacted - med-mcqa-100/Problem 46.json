Based on your previous mistake and the new information provided, I will answer the question correctly.\n\nThe characteristic feature of rapid progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is the presence of crescent-shaped deposits under a light microscope. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Acute GN.\n\nHere is my reasoning:\n\n1. Identify the characteristic features of each type of glomerulonephritis:\n\t* Membranous GN: thin, irregular, and incomplete deposits\n\t* Membranoproliferative GN: thick, irregular, and incomplete deposits\n\t* RPGN: crescent-shaped deposits\n2. Look for crescent-shaped deposits under a light microscope:\n\t* Membranous GN: no crescent-shaped deposits\n\t* Membranoproliferative GN: no crescent-shaped deposits\n\t* RPGN: present crescent-shaped deposits\n3. Recognize that crescent-shaped deposits are a characteristic feature of RPGN:\n\t* RPGN: yes, crescent-shaped deposits are present\n\t* Membranous GN: no, no crescent-shaped deposits\n\t* Membranoproliferative GN: no, no crescent-shaped deposits\n4. Choose the correct answer based on your knowledge of the characteristics of each type of glomerulonephritis:\n\t* RPGN: (B) Acute GN\n\nI hope this answer is helpful, and please let me know if you have any further questions."
