One of the major complications of this procedure is hemorrhage.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the surgical procedure being discussed: cyst-gastrostomy.\n2. List the major complications of the procedure: infection, obstruction, fistula, and hemorrhage.\n3. Choose the correct answer based on the information provided.\n4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the major complications of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst are infection, obstruction, fistula, and hemorrhage, not fistula and hemorrhage.\n"
