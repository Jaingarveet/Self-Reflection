I made an error in my previous response as I misunderstood the question and chose the incorrect answer. Thank you for pointing that out, and I will make sure to be more careful in the future.\n\nExplanation:\nSubtle seizures are the most common type of seizure in newborns, accounting for approximately 60% of all seizures in this age group. These seizures are characterized by a brief loss of muscle tone, which can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. They can occur in both term and preterm newborns and are often not noticed by parents or healthcare providers.\n\nIn contrast, clonic seizures are characterized by a sudden, repetitive jerking of the arms, legs, or entire body. Tonic seizures are characterized by a sudden stiffening of the muscles, while myoclonic seizures are characterized by sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand the correct answer to the question.
