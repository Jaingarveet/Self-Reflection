I misidentified the carbohydrate due to confusion and incorrect knowledge.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, I will break it down into smaller steps:\n\n1. Identify the type of biofilm present in dental plaque: Dental plaque is a sticky biofilm that forms on teeth.\n2. List the components of dental plaque: Dental plaque contains various components, including carbohydrates, proteins, and microorganisms.\n3. Identify the most common carbohydrate found in dental plaque: The most common carbohydrate found in dental plaque is dextran.\n4. Use the correct term for the sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque: The sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque is dextran.\n5. Double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy: I have double-checked my calculations, and the answer is indeed dextran.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Dextran.\n\nAdvice: Always use precise terminology when discussing scientific topics, take the time to thoroughly understand the question and the topic at hand, break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps, double-check your work to ensure accuracy, and stay up-to-date with the latest research and developments in the field of medicine."
