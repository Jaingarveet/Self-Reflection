The isthmus is actually the narrowest part of the uterine tube near the cervix, but it is not the entire length of the tube.\n\nThank you for pointing out my error, and I will make sure to be more careful in the future.\n\nKeywords:\n\n* Interstitial part\n* Isthmus\n* Ampulla\n* Infundibulum\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
