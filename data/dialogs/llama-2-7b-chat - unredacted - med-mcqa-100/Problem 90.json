It can be due to:\nChoices:\n  A: Oligohydramnios\n  B: Placenta pre\n  C: Pelvic tumor\n  D: Uterine anomalies\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat, let's break down the problem and solution:\n\nQuestion: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal deliveries has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:\n\nChoices:\n\nA: Oligohydramnios\nB: Placenta previa\nC: Pelvic tumor\nD: Uterine anomalies\n\nThought: The patient's unstable lie at 34 weeks of gestation with a previous history of two normal deliveries could be due to several possible causes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\") Uterine anomalies.\n\nExplanation: Uterine anomalies, such as a bicornuate uterus or a unicornuate uterus, can cause an unstable lie in a pregnancy. These anomalies can lead to a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, which can cause the fetus to lie in an unstable position. Other possible causes of an unstable lie at this gestational age include placenta previa or oligohydramnios. However, pelvic tumors are less common and are unlikely to cause this symptom at this stage of pregnancy.\n\nNow, let's analyze the problem and the correct answer:\n\nError:\nThe error in the initial answer was selecting option D, Uterine anomalies. While uterine anomalies can cause an unstable lie, it is not the most likely cause at 34 weeks of gestation with a previous history of two normal deliveries.\n\nCorrect Answer:\nThe correct answer is option B, Placenta previa. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta is low-lying in the uterus and can cause an unstable lie. It is a more common cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks of gestation than uterine anomalies.\n\nKeywords:\n\n* Unstable lie\n* Multigravida\n* Previous normal deliveries\n* Gestational age\n* Causes\n* Uterine anomalies\n* Placenta previa\n* Oligohydramnios\n\nInstructions for future reference:\n\n1. Always carefully read the question and options before answering.\n2. Consider the patient's history and symptoms when selecting a cause.\n3. Use keywords to narrow down the possible causes.\n4. Double-check your answer and reasoning before submitting.\n5. Remember that placenta previa is a common cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks of gestation.\n6. Be aware of the other possible causes, such as oligohydramnios and uterine anomalies, but consider them less likely at this gestational age with a previous history of normal deliveries.\n"
