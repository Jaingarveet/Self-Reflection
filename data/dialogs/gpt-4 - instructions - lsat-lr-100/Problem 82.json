Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the original argument made by Patricia.\n2. Understand the counter-argument made by Tamara.\n3. Identify the point of contention between the two arguments.\n4. Evaluate the options based on how effectively they counter Tamara's argument and support Patricia's original claim.\n5. Choose the answer that best supports Patricia's argument against Tamara's objection.\n"

Tamara counters this by stating that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of a ninja's presence. The point of contention is whether the fear of ninjas was widespread in Japan during the Tokugawa period. \nTo counter Tamara's argument, Patricia needs to provide evidence that undermines the claim that squeaky floors were a widespread precaution against ninjas. \nOption A does not counter Tamara's argument as it only extends the claim to poor Japanese, implying that fear of ninjas was even more widespread. \nOption B could potentially counter Tamara's argument by suggesting that squeaky floors would not have been an effective deterrent against ninjas, but it does not directly address the claim about the level of fear in the population. \nOption C could counter Tamara's argument by suggesting that the fear of ninjas was not widespread but confined to a small portion of the population. \nOption D does not directly counter Tamara's argument as it does not address the claim about the level of fear in the population during the Tokugawa period. \nOption E does not counter Tamara's argument as it does not address the claim about the level of fear in the population during the Tokugawa period. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
