What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Find the speed of the space shuttle:\n   * In 40 seconds, it travels 700m high.\n   * Speed = Distance / Time\n   * Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s\n2. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds:\n   * Distance = Speed × Time\n   * Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s = 87.5 m\n3. The length of the shuttle is the distance it travels in the time it takes to pass a point.\n   * Length of shuttle = Distance traveled in 5 seconds / Time taken to pass a point\n   * Length of shuttle = 87.5 m / 5 s = 17.5 m\n4. Multiply by 5 to convert to the correct units:\n   * Length of shuttle = 17.5 m × 5 = 87.5 m\nTherefore, the correct length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters, which rounds up to [REDACTED]eters (Choice C).\n"
