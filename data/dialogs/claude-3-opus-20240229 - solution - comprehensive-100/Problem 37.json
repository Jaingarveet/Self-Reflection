Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe passage states: \"which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer.\" \nThis directly implies that cats produce different allergy-causing proteins.\nIf all cats produced the exact same proteins, the proteins causing an individual's allergies would not vary.\nTherefore, not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins in their skin secretions and saliva.\nWhile the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone, this implication about protein variability in cats is more direct.\n"
