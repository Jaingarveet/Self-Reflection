Not shuffling the cards could allow some players to predict the cards that will come up later, which would give these players an unfair advantage.\n\nChoices:\n\nA: There are different ways to shuffle, but a poker shuffle will typically consist of two riffles, a box, another riffle, and a cut. (Correct)\n\nExplanation: A poker shuffle involves splitting the deck in half, mixing them together by placing the corners of the cards in each half against each other, and then cutting the deck. This randomizes the order of the cards and introduces chance to the game, making it fair for all players.\n\nB: Take the \"left,\" \"right,\" and \"bring\" of the deck and place them in one of the center corners. (Incorrect)\n\nExplanation: This option does not involve shuffling the deck at all, but rather placing specific cards in a corner of the deck. This would not introduce chance to the game and would give an unfair advantage to the player who placed the cards.\n\nC: Shuffle the cards and place them in order. (Incorrect)\n\nExplanation: Shuffling the cards and placing them in order would not introduce chance to the game and would not make it fair for all players.\n\nD: Showing players cards that played in others' hands normally means you can show them the actual cards that will go up in a moment. (Incorrect)\n\nExplanation: This option does not relate to shuffling the deck or making the game fair for all players. It is a different concept altogether."
