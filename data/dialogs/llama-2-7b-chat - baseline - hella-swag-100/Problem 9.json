Avoid contact with it and try not to rub the mud deeper into the carpet.\n\nChoices:\n\nA: When cleaning mud off wood, be sure to use a dry brush in order to get it off. Do not scrub the mud, as this could cause further damage to your hardwood carpeting.\n\nCorrect! When cleaning mud off a carpet, it's important to avoid rubbing it deeper into the carpet as it can cause further damage. Instead, use a dry brush to gently remove the mud, allowing it to flake off on its own.\n\nB: The deeper the stain is rubbed in, the more difficult it is to remove it.\nIncorrect. While it's true that the deeper the stain is rubbed in, the more difficult it can be to remove, the text does not suggest this as the most likely completion.\n\nC: Allow the mud to dry overnight, and then vacuum the area carefully with a damp cloth.\nIncorrect. While allowing the mud to dry overnight and then vacuuming it with a damp cloth may be a good solution, it's not the most likely completion to the text.\n\nD: Press and roll the rug to remove as much of the dirt as possible. Once the mud has dried completely, reor replace the rug according to the instructions accompanying the tag.\nIncorrect. While pressing and rolling the rug may help remove some of the dirt, it's not the most likely completion to the text."
