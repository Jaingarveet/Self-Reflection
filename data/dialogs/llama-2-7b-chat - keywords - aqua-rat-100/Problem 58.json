The key to solving this problem is to recognize that both balls are making full rotations, and the time it takes for one ball to make a full rotation is the same as the time it takes for the other ball to make 5 full rotations.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nSelf-Reflection:\n\nI reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and calculated the time it would take for one ball to make a full rotation, instead of recognizing that both balls are making full rotations. I also failed to consider the fact that the time it takes for one ball to make a full rotation is the same as the time it takes for the other ball to make 5 full rotations.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I used the information that Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, and Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. I then calculated the time it would take for both balls to be at the same starting point again, and I arrived at the answer \"B: 2 hour and 31 minutes\".\n\nI learned that it is important to carefully read and understand the problem before starting to calculate the answer. I also learned that it is essential to recognize patterns and relationships in the problem to arrive at the correct solution."
