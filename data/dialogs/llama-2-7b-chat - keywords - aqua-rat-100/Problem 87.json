I misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking for the number of permutations of 2 oranges chosen from the basket, which would be calculated using the formula n! (n factorial). However, the problem actually asked for the number of combinations of 2 oranges chosen from the basket, which is calculated using the formula nC2 (n choose 2).\n\nTo calculate the number of combinations of 2 oranges chosen from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the formula nC2 = n! / (n-2)!. Plugging in n = 10, we get:\n\nnC2 = 10! / (10-2)! = 10 x 8 = 80\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 90.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
