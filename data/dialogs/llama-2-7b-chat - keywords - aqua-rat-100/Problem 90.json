If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, and it pays $210 per week for newspapers, we can set up the following equation:\n\nSunday papers = 2 x Monday papers\n\nSubstituting the cost of a newspaper on Sunday into the equation, we get:\n\nSunday papers = 2 x Monday papers = $4 x 2 = $8\n\nSo, the hotel buys 8 newspapers on Monday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
