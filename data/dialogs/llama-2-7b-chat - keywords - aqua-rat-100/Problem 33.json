I calculated the area of the semi-circles as half the diameter, but I should have used the radius instead. This resulted in an incorrect calculation of the area of the remaining paper.\n\nCorrect Solution: To find the area of the remaining paper, we need to calculate the area of the two semi-circles and then subtract it from the area of the original square paper. The radius of each semi-circle is half the diameter, so the radius of the first semi-circle is 10 cm (since the diameter is 20 cm). The area of the first semi-circle is:\n\nArea = πr^2 = π(10)^2 = 80π\n\nSimilarly, the area of the second semi-circle is:\n\nArea = πr^2 = π(10)^2 = 80π\n\nThe total area of the two semi-circles is 80π + 80π = 160π.\n\nThe area of the original square paper is 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the remaining paper is:\n\nArea = 400 cm^2 - 160π = 400 cm^2 - 160(80π) = 400 cm^2 - 12800π\n\nSo, the area of the remaining paper is approximately 8.75 cm^2 (rounded to the nearest whole number).\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
