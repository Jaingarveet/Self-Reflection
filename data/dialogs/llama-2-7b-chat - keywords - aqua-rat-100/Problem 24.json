I see that I misapplied the formula and made a calculation error.\n\nAction: I will re-evaluate the problem using the correct formula and calculation.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is (zy – 2)/z.\n\nExplanation: The problem states that the average score for the entire class is equal to y, and there are z students in the class. The highest score is x, and the lowest score is also x. We are asked to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula (zy – 2)/z, where z is the number of students in the class, y is the average score for the entire class, and x is the highest and lowest scores.\n\nI hope this answer is correct, and I will make sure to double-check my calculations to avoid making the same mistake again."
