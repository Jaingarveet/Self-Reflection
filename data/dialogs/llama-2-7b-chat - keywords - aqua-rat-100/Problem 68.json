I calculated the LCM of 350 and 7700 by multiplying 350 and 7700 directly, which is incorrect. The correct method is to find the prime factors of each number and then find the common prime factors.\n\nThe prime factors of 350 are 2, 3, and 5, and the prime factors of 7700 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The common prime factors are 2 and 3, so the LCM is 2 x 3 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the other integer is 630 (350 x 6 = 2100).\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
