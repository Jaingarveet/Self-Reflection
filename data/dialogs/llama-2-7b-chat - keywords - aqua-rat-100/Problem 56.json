I misunderstood the problem and calculated the interest rate incorrectly.\n\nAction: Let's re-evaluate the problem step by step to find the correct answer.\n\nThe problem states that a man borrows Rs.360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50. To find the interest rate, we need to divide the amount borrowed by the number of installments.\n\nRs.360 / 12 installments = Rs.31.50 per installment\n\nNow, we need to find the interest rate by dividing the amount borrowed by the total amount paid back:\n\nRs.360 / Rs.31.50 = 11.25%\n\nTherefore, the interest rate is 11.25%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
