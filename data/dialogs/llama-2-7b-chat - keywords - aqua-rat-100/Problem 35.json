To calculate the minimum sale required to achieve this, I will use the formula:\n\nMonthly income = Monthly salary + Commission\n\nMonthly salary = 1500 Rupees\nCommission = 15% of monthly sale\n\nSo, the minimum sale required to achieve a monthly income of 6000 Rupees is:\n\nMonthly sale = 1500 + (15% of 30000) = 1500 + 4500 = 5950\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 415000 Rupees.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED (information not provided in the question)\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
