To solve this problem, I need to calculate the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.\n\nAction:\nLet's break down the information given in the problem:\n\n* 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored.\n* 90% of the rest are squashed.\n\nWe can calculate the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates by subtracting the percentage of cocoa flavored chocolates from 100%:\n\n100% - 10% = 90%\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. We can do this by subtracting the percentage of squashed chocolates from the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:\n\n90% - 9% = 81%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 81%.\n\nAnswer: (C) 5%."
