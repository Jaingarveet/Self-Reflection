I misunderstood the problem and calculated the area of the yard as 3,000 square feet, which is not the correct answer.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangular shape, which is: Area = Length x Width.\n\nGiven that one side of the yard is 100 feet wide, and the total area of the yard is 3,000 square feet, we can set up the equation:\n\nLength x Width = 3,000\n\nNow, we can solve for the length of the other side of the yard:\n\nLength = 3,000 / Width\n\nWidth = 3,000 / Length\n\nSubstituting the values given in the question, we get:\n\nLength = 60 feet\n\nTherefore, the length of the other side of Julie's yard is 60 feet.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
