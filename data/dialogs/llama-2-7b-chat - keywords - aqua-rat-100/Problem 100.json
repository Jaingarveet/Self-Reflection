The problem is asking for the perimeter of a rectangular piece of land with a length that is 1m more than 4 times the breadth. To find the perimeter, I need to use the formula P = 2(l + 2b), where l is the length and b is the breadth.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI made a mistake in my previous answer by not properly understanding the equation. I misunderstood the problem and used the wrong formula. I also made a calculation mistake by not properly distributing the 1m increase in length.
