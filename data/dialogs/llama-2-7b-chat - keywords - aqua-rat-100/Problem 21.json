Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI misunderstood the problem and thought it was asking for the total work done by x men in x days, rather than the work done by y men in y days. I calculated the answer incorrectly and selected option A, which is not the correct solution.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, we need to use the formula:\nWork done = Number of men x Hours per day x Work done per hour\n\nSo, if x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, then y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: x3/y2 units.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
