I misunderstood the information provided in the question and made an incorrect assumption about the train's speed after it started raining. I also made a calculation error in determining the total distance traveled by the train.\n\nAction: I will re-evaluate the problem using the correct information and assumptions.\n\nTotal journey duration = distance / speed = (distance / 2) / (speed before rain) + (distance / 2) / (speed after rain)\n\nDistance = 100 miles / 2 = 50 miles\nSpeed before rain = 100 miles/hour = 50 miles / 10 hours = 5 miles/hour\nSpeed after rain = 75 miles/hour = 50 miles / 10.5 hours = 4.7 miles/hour\n\nTotal journey duration = (50 miles / 5 miles/hour) + (50 miles / 4.7 miles/hour) = 11.5 hours\n\nAnswer: B - 11.5 hours."
