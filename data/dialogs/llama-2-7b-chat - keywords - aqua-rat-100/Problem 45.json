Here's my reflection:\n\nI calculated the cost price of the sewing machine to be Rs. 1200, and then I calculated the discount as 20% of the cost price, which is Rs. 240. However, I made a mistake in my calculation. I should have calculated the discount as 20% of the selling price, not the cost price.\n\nSo, the correct calculation for the selling price is:\n\nSelling price = Cost price + Discount\n= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240\n= Rs. 1440\n\nTherefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit is Rs. 1440.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
