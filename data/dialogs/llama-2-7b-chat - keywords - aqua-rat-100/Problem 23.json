To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula:\n\nCost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit percentage)\n\nSo, the cost price of the article is:\n\nCost price = 360 / (1 + 0.20)\n= 360 / 1.20\n= 300\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 300.\n\nError Keywords: Calculation error, Arithmetic error, Misapplication of formula.\n\nNote: The previous answer I provided was incorrect, and I apologize for any confusion caused. Thank you for giving me another chance to solve the problem correctly."
