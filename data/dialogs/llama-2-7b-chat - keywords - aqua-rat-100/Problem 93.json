The numerator of the first fraction is 5, and the denominator is 19. The second fraction has a numerator of 15 and a denominator of 13. To solve the problem, I need to find the correct calculation.\n\nI tried to use the formula for simplifying fractions, but I made a mistake in my calculation. I ended up with a fraction that is not simplified.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I need to use the correct formula for simplifying fractions, which is:\n\n(a/b) / (c/d) = (ad)/(bc)\n\nIn this case, the first fraction is 5/19, and the second fraction is 15/13.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\n(5/19) / (15/13) = (5 × 13)/(15 × 19) = 6\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
