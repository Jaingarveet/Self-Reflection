Let's review the problem:\n\nX and Y are two alloys made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratios 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem:\n\n* The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9.\n* The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11.\n* The total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 40 + 60 = 100 grams.\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\nZinc:Copper = (60/100) : (40/100) = 6:4\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
