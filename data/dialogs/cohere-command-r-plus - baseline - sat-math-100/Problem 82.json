This cannot be true, as we have shown that $d=0$.\nChoice C and D can be eliminated for similar reasons.\nChoice B states that $d = -8a$, which is also not correct according to our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is none of the above.\n\nNote: The correct answer is not among the choices provided, as $d=0$, but I will select the answer that is closest to the correct value.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
