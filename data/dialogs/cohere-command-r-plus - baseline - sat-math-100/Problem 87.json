Setting these equal to each other gives:\n$(x-11)^2 = 25$\n$(x-11)^2 = 5^2$\n$x-11 = 5$ or $x-11 = -5$\n$x = 16$ or $x = 6$\n\nThese $x$-values can be used to find the $y$-coordinates:\nWhen $x = 16$, $y = (16-11)^2 = 25$, and\nwhen $x = 6$, $y = (6-11)^2 = 25$.\n\nSo, the two points of intersection are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$.\n\nTo find the length of the line segment joining these points, we can use the distance formula:\n$\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$\n$= \\sqrt{(16-6)^2 + (25-25)^2}$\n$= \\sqrt{100} = 10$\n\nTherefore, the length of $\\overline{AB} = 10$ units.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
