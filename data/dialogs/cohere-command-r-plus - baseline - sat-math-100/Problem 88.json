To find out when it hits the ground (i.e., when its height is zero), we need to solve for $t$ when $h=0$.\n\nSetting $h=0$, we get:\n$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$\n\nTo solve for $t$, we can use the quadratic formula:\n$t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$t = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{25^2 - 4 \\cdot -4.9 \\cdot 0}}{2 \\cdot -4.9}$\n$t \\approx 3.53$ or $t \\approx 1.47$ seconds\n\nSince we're interested in the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, we ignore the negative value and approximate the answer to the nearest tenth:\n$t \\approx 3.5$ seconds\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
