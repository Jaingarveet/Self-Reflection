To find the initial velocity ($v$), we need to consider the values at $t=0$.\n\nPlugging $t=0$ into the equation, we get:\n$h = -16(0)^2 + v(0) + k$\nThis simplifies to:\n$v = \\frac{h-k}{0}$\n\nNotice that this is undefined because you cannot divide by zero, which makes sense since at $t=0$ the ball is not moving up or down. So, we can conclude that the initial velocity ($v$) cannot be expressed solely based on the information at $t=0$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nOption A: $v = h + k - 16t$\nThis doesn't make sense physically because if $t=0$, then $v=h+k$, which doesn't represent the initial velocity.\n\nOption B: $v = \\frac{h-k+16}{t}$\nThis doesn't work because when $t=0$, we don't want $v$ to be undefined again (division by zero).\n\nOption C: $v = \\frac{h+k}{t} - 16t$\nThis is similar to Option A and doesn't work for the same reason.\n\nOption D: $v = \\frac{h-k}{t} + 16t$\nThis choice correctly represents the initial velocity. When $t=0$, we have $v=0$, which is what we expect for the initial condition. Additionally, the units work out correctly - the $16t$ term represents the acceleration due to gravity ($-16$ feet per second squared) multiplied by time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
