However, I failed to consider the potential risks associated with propylthiouracil in later stages of pregnancy.\n**Correct Answer:** The safest antithyroid drug for use during pregnancy is methimazole.\n**Explanation:**\n* **Methimazole:** While it carries a small risk of birth defects in the first trimester, this risk is significantly lower than that associated with propylthiouracil in later stages of pregnancy. Methimazole is also associated with a lower risk of liver problems compared to propylthiouracil.\n* **Propylthiouracil:** Although it is considered safer than methimazole in the first trimester, propylthiouracil carries a higher risk of severe liver problems in later stages of pregnancy. This risk can be life-threatening for both the mother and the baby.\n* **I121:** This radioactive iodine treatment is not safe for use during pregnancy as it can cause significant harm to the developing fetus.\n* **Carbimazole:** This drug is not available in the United States and its safety profile during pregnancy is not well-established.\nTherefore, based on the updated information and considering the risks and benefits of each medication, the safest antithyroid drug for use during pregnancy is methimazole.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\") \n"
