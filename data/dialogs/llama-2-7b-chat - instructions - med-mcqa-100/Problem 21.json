However, upon further reflection, I realized that Falciparum malaria actually targets young RBCs, not senescent RBCs.\n\nTo answer the current question, I will use the information provided in the question to identify the type of malaria that affects senescent RBCs. The options are:\n\nA: Vivax malaria\nB: Ovale malaria\nC: Falciparum malaria\nD: Quartan malaria\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is (A) Vivax malaria. Vivax malaria is the only type of malaria that affects senescent RBCs.\n\nCharacteristics of Vivax malaria:\n\n* Vivax malaria is caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite.\n* It is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.\n* The parasite enters the RBC and multiplies, causing the RBC to become infected and degenerate.\n* Vivax malaria can cause both acute and chronic infections.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (A) Vivax malaria attacks senescent RBCs."
