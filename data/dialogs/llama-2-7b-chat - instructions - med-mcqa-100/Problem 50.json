Identify the veins that drain into the inferior vena cava:\n\t* Superior vena cava\n\t* Inferior vena cava\n2. Label the tributary veins of the inferior vena cava:\n\t* Inferior mesenteric vein\n\t* Common iliac vein\n\t* External iliac vein\n\t* Common femoral vein\n\t* External femoral vein\n3. Recall the correct anatomy of the inferior vena cava and its tributary veins:\n\t* The inferior vena cava is a large vein that drains blood from the lower extremities and pelvis\n\t* It receives blood from the inferior mesenteric vein, which drains the intestines, kidneys, and other organs in the pelvis\n\t* The inferior vena cava also receives blood from the common iliac vein, which drains the lower abdomen and pelvis\n\t* The inferior vena cava empties into the right atrium of the heart\n4. Double-check my work to ensure accuracy:\n\t* I have correctly identified the tributary veins of the inferior vena cava\n\t* I have correctly identified the correct answer as (B) Inferior mesenteric vein\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is (B) Inferior mesenteric vein."
