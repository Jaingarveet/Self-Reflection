The uterine tube, also known as the fallopian tube, is a narrow, muscular tube that connects the ovary to the uterus. The part of the uterine tube being referred to in the question is the narrowest part, which is the ampulla.\n\nBased on my knowledge of anatomy, the ampulla is the narrowest part of the uterine tube, located at the junction of the ampulla and the isthmus. It is the site where the fertilization of the egg by sperm occurs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Ampulla.\n\nDouble-check:\nTo ensure accuracy, I will double-check my answer by consulting a reliable anatomy textbook or online resource. According to these sources, the ampulla is indeed the narrowest part of the uterine tube.\n\nAnswer: (B) Ampulla"
