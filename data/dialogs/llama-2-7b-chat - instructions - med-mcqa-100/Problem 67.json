The major complications of this procedure are:\n\n1. Infection: Bacterial infection can occur in the incision site or within the abdominal cavity, leading to sepsis and organ failure.\n2. Obstruction: The cyst-gastrostomy can become blocked by scar tissue or debris, preventing the drainage of the cyst and causing abdominal pain and distension.\n3. Fistula: An abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin can occur, leading to leakage of fluid or gas and potentially life-threatening complications.\n4. Hemorrhage: Bleeding can occur during or after the procedure, leading to hypovolemic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is (B) Obstruction.\n\nDouble-check:\nI have carefully reviewed the information provided, and I am confident in my answer. The correct answer is (B) Obstruction."
