It is essential to ensure that the groups are comparable in terms of relevant factors, such as age, gender, and other characteristics, to ensure that the results are valid and reliable.\n\nReflection: I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the concept of randomization. I thought it meant equal and unknown chances, but it actually means unequal and known chances. This is because the randomization process involves intentionally assigning participants to different groups, rather than randomly assigning them to either group.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
