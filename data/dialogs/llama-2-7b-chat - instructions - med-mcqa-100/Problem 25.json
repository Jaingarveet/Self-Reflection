I also noticed that the biopsy results showed no evidence of cystic fibrosis. Based on these findings, I believe the correct diagnosis is (B) Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This condition is characterized by a thickening of the pyloric ring, which can cause delays in meconium passage and abdominal distension. The bilious vomiting is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
