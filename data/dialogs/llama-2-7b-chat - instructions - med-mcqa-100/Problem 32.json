I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on my thought process and improve my diagnostic skills.\nIn this case, I should have considered nasal polyps as a possible diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings. I also should have evaluated the patient for other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as rhinoscleroma, [REDACTED], or rhinosporidiosis. Consulting with a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist), would have helped confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan."
