I thought it was injected into the portal vein, but it is actually transplanted into the liver.\n\nThe liver is the site of transplantation for islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus. The islets are surgically removed from a donor pancreas and transplanted into the liver of the recipient. The liver provides a suitable environment for the islets to function properly, and the transplanted islets can produce insulin to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer, and I hope this reflection helps me to better understand the topic.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
