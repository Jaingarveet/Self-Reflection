There is also evidence of pulmonary edema, with an increased opacity in the lung fields.\n\nType of congenital heart defect:\nBased on the chest X-ray findings, the most likely diagnosis is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). This is because a VSD is a common type of congenital heart defect that can cause heart failure and pulmonary edema, as seen on the chest X-ray.\n\nMost probable diagnosis:\nTherefore, the most probable diagnosis is VSD.\n\nDouble-checking calculations and final answer:\nI have double-checked my calculations and final answer, and I am confident that VSD is the most probable diagnosis based on the chest X-ray findings.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
