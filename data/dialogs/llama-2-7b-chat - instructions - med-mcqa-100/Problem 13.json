CT is the most appropriate investigation for patients with severe symptoms, such as those who are vomiting frequently or have signs of dehydration. USG may be more appropriate for younger patients or those with mild symptoms. UGI series may also be considered for patients with suspected pyloric stenosis, but it may not be as accurate as CT or USG in diagnosing the condition.\n\nIt is important to understand the advantages and limitations of each investigation to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of pyloric stenosis. Double-checking the answer to ensure accuracy is crucial in this case, as misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to serious complications for the patient."
