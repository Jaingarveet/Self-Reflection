From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:\n   $2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$\n   $-1.5y = -2.4x + 0.3$\n   $y = \\frac{2.4x - 0.3}{1.5} = 1.6x - 0.2$\n2) Now, substitute this expression for y into the second equation:\n   $1.6x + 0.5(1.6x - 0.2) = -1.3$\n   $1.6x + 0.8x - 0.1 = -1.3$\n   $2.4x = -1.2$\n   $x = -0.5$\n3) Now that we have x, we can find y by substituting x back into either of the original equations. Let's use the first equation:\n   $2.4(-0.5) - 1.5y = 0.3$\n   $-1.2 - 1.5y = 0.3$\n   $-1.5y = 1.5$\n   $y = -1$\n4) Therefore, the point of intersection is (-0.5, -1).\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
