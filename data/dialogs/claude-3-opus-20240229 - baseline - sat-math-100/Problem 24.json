It's 0 if and only if the number itself is 0, and positive otherwise.\n3) So, for $|n-1|+1$ to be equal to 0, we need $|n-1|$ to be equal to -1.\n4) But as we said in step 2, the absolute value is always non-negative. It can never be -1.\n5) Therefore, there is no value of $n$ for which $|n-1|+1$ is equal to 0.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
