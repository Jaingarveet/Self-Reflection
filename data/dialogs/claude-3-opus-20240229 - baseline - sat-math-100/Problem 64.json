This means we cannot determine unique values for x and y.\n2) The question asks for the value of $\\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. Let's simplify this:\n   $\\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \\frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \\frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$\n3) Now, if we could determine the value of $3x-y$, we could find the value of $\\frac{8^x}{2^y}$. But from step 1, we know that we cannot determine unique values for x and y.\n4) Therefore, we do not have enough information to determine the value of $\\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
