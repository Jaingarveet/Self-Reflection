The endpoint is given as $(\\frac{4}{3}, 5)$.\n4) The distance formula is $\\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. Here, $(x_1,y_1)=(0,4)$ and $(x_2,y_2)=(\\frac{4}{3}, 5)$.\n   $r = \\sqrt{(\\frac{4}{3}-0)^2 + (5-4)^2} = \\sqrt{(\\frac{4}{3})^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{9} + 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{9}} = \\frac{5}{3}$\n5) Substituting $h=0$, $k=4$, and $r=\\frac{5}{3}$ into the general equation:\n   $(x-0)^2 + (y-4)^2 = (\\frac{5}{3})^2$\n   $x^2 + (y-4)^2 = \\frac{25}{9}$\n6) This matches choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
