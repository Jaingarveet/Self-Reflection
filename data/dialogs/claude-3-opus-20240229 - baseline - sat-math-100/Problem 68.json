Let's substitute this into the equation:\n   $0.10x + 0.20(100) = 0.18(x+100)$\n3) Simplify:\n   \n   $0.10x + 20 = 0.18x + 18$\n4) Subtract 18 from both sides:\n   $0.10x + 2 = 0.18x$\n5) Subtract $0.10x$ from both sides:\n   $2 = 0.08x$\n6) Divide both sides by 0.08:\n   $x = 2 / 0.08 = 25$\nTherefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the 10% saline solution.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
