Let's use this information to find the value of $k$.\n   $24 = k(6)$\n   $24 = 6k$\n   $k = 24/6 = 4$\n3) So, the equation is $y = 4x$.\n4) Now, we need to find the value of $y$ when $x = 5$. Let's substitute $x = 5$ into the equation:\n   $y = 4(5) = 20$\nTherefore, when $x = 5$, $y = 20$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
