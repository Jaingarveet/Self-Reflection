        "content": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) The ball hits the ground when the height, $h$, is equal to 0. So, we need to solve the equation:\n   $0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t$\n2) Dividing both sides by -4.9, we get:\n   $0 = t^2 - \\frac{25}{4.9}t$\n3) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it by factoring:\n   $0 = t(t - \\frac{25}{4.9})$\n4) The solutions are $t = 0$ and $t = \\frac{25}{4.9}$. The first solution, $t = 0$, corresponds to the initial launch time. The second solution is the time when the ball hits the ground.\n5) Calculating $\\frac{25}{4.9}$:\n   $\\frac{25}{4.9} \\approx 5.10$\n6) Therefore, the ball will hit the ground approximately 5.10 seconds after it is launched.\nAmong the given choices, 5.0 seconds is the closest to 5.10 seconds.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
