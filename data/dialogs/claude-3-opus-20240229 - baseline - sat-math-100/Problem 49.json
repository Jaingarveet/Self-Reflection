This is because the denominators are the same on both sides $(ax-2)$.\n2) Equating the numerators:\n   $24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x(ax-2) - 3(ax-2) - 53$\n3) Expanding the right side:\n   $24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8ax^2 + 16x - 3ax + 6 - 53$\n   \n   $24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8ax^2 + (16-3a)x - 47$\n4) For this to be true for all $x$, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ must be equal on both sides. Let's equate the coefficients of $x^2$:\n   $24 = -8a$\n   \n   $a = -3$\n5) We can verify this by equating the coefficients of $x$:\n   $25 = 16-3a = 16-3(-3) = 16+9 = 25$\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is -3.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
