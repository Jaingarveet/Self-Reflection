        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1) Let's define some variables:\n   Let F_L be the number of left-handed females\n   Let F_R be the number of right-handed females\n   Let M_L be the number of left-handed males\n   Let M_R be the number of right-handed males\n2) We're told that there are 5 times as many right-handed females as left-handed females, and 9 times as many right-handed males as left-handed males. So:\n   F_R = 5 * F_L\n   M_R = 9 * M_L\n3) We're also told that there are 18 left-handed students in total and 122 right-handed students in total. So:\n   F_L + M_L = 18\n   F_R + M_R = 122\n4) Substituting the equations from step 2 into the equations from step 3:\n   F_L + M_L = 18\n   5*F_L + 9*M_L = 122\n5) Now we have a system of equations. Let's solve for F_L and M_L:\n   From the first equation: M_L = 18 - F_L\n   Substituting this into the second equation:\n   5*F_L + 9*(18 - F_L) = 122\n   5*F_L + 162 - 9*F_L = 122\n   -4*F_L = -40\n   F_L = 10\n   Substituting this back into the equation M_L = 18 - F_L:\n   M_L = 18 - 10 = 8\n6) Now that we have F_L and M_L, we can calculate F_R and M_R:\n   F_R = 5 * F_L = 5 * 10 = 50\n   M_R = 9 * M_L = 9 * 8 = 72\n7) The probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:\n   P(Right-handed and Female) = F_R / (F_R + M_R) = 50 / (50 + 72) = 50 / 122 â‰ˆ 0.410\nTherefore, the answer closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is 0.410.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
