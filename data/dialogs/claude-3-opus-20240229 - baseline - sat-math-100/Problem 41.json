This is because when $x=a$, the factor $(x-a)$ becomes zero, making the whole polynomial zero.\n2) Looking at the table, we see that $f(4) = 0$.\n3) This means that $(x-4)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$, because when $x=4$, $f(x)$ becomes zero.\n4) None of the other choices have this property. For example, $f(2) = 1$, so $(x-2)$ is not a factor, and so on.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: $x-4$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
