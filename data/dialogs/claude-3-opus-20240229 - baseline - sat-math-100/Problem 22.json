This means that the average number of students per classroom is increasing by 0.56 each year.\n5) The y-intercept is 27.2, which means that the average number of students per classroom in 2000 was 27.2.\nTherefore, the number 0.56 in the equation represents the estimated increase in the average number of students per classroom each year.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
