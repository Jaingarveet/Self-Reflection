        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) First, we need to find the average number of earthworms per square meter. To do this, we sum up the number of earthworms in each region and divide by the number of regions.\n   Total earthworms = 107 + 147 + 146 + 135 + 149 + 141 + 150 + 154 + 176 + 166 = 1,471\n   Average earthworms per square meter = 1,471 / 10 = 147.1\n2) Now, we know the average number of earthworms in a 1m x 1m area. The entire field is 10m x 10m, which is an area of 100 square meters.\n3) To estimate the total number of earthworms in the field, we multiply the average number of earthworms per square meter by the total area of the field in square meters.\n   Estimated total earthworms = 147.1 * 100 = 14,710\n4) Looking at the choices, the closest answer to 14,710 is 15,000.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
