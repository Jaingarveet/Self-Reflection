        "content": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) We need to find when the price of beef (b) is equal to the price of chicken (c). In other words, we need to solve the equation:\n   $2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x$\n2) Subtract 1.75 from both sides:\n   $0.60 + 0.25x = 0.40x$\n3) Subtract 0.25x from both sides:\n   $0.60 = 0.15x$\n4) Divide both sides by 0.15:\n   $x = 4$\n5) Now that we know the value of x when the prices are equal, we can substitute this value into either equation to find the price. Let's use the beef equation:\n   $b = 2.35 + 0.25(4)$\n      $= 2.35 + 1$\n      $= 3.35$\nTherefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $3.35.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
