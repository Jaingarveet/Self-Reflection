        "content": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) We're told there's a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight. This means the function will be of the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n2) To find the slope, let's choose two points from the table. Let's use (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89).\n   Slope = $\\frac{change\\text{ }in\\text{ }y}{change\\text{ }in\\text{ }x} = \\frac{21.89 - 16.94}{10 - 5} = \\frac{4.95}{5} = 0.99$\n   So, $m = 0.99$.\n3) Now that we have the slope, we can use any point to find the y-intercept. Let's use (5, 16.94).\n   $16.94 = 0.99(5) + b$\n   $16.94 = 4.95 + b$\n   $b = 16.94 - 4.95 = 11.99$\n4) Therefore, the function is $f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
