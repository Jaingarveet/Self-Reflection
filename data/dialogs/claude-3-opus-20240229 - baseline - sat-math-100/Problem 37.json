We don't know these values, but we know that πr²h = 22.\n3) Now, we're asked about a new cylinder. Let's call it cylinder B. Its radius is twice that of cylinder A (so it's 2r), and its height is half that of cylinder A (so it's h/2).\n4) The volume of cylinder B is:\n   V_B = π(2r)²(h/2)\n       = π(4r²)(h/2)\n       = 2πr²h\n5) But we know that πr²h = 22 (from step 2). So:\n   V_B = 2(22) = 44\nTherefore, the volume of cylinder B is 44 cubic centimeters.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
