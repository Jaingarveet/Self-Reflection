This is a product of two terms.\n2) To multiply these terms, we distribute $2x$ to each term inside the parentheses:\n   $2x(x^2 - 3x) = 2x(x^2) - 2x(3x)$\n3) Simplify each term:\n   \n   $2x(x^2) = 2x^3$\n   \n   $2x(3x) = 6x^2$\n4) So, the expression becomes:\n   $2x(x^2 - 3x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2$\n5) Looking at the choices, the answer that matches this is choice D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
