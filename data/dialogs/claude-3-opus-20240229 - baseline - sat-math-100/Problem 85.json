Therefore, $\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ increases by $\\frac{5}{9}$. So statement I is true.\n3) Statement II: If C increases by 1, then $\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ increases by 1. This means $(F-32)$ increases by $\\frac{9}{5}$, so F increases by $\\frac{9}{5}$, which is 1.8. So statement II is also true.\n4) Statement III: If F increases by $\\frac{5}{9}$, then $(F-32)$ increases by $\\frac{5}{9}$. Therefore, $\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$ increases by $(\\frac{5}{9})^2$, which is not equal to 1. So statement III is false.\n5) Therefore, only statements I and II are true.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
