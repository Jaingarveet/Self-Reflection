We can calculate this using the formula:\n   P(Always | Not Never) = P(Always and Not Never) / P(Not Never)\n2) P(Always and Not Never) is just P(Always), because \"Always\" and \"Never\" are mutually exclusive. From the table, P(Always) = 30.9% = 0.309.\n3) To find P(Not Never), we can subtract P(Never) from 1:\n   \n   P(Not Never) = 1 - P(Never) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687\n4) Now we can calculate the conditional probability:\n   P(Always | Not Never) = 0.309 / 0.687 â‰ˆ 0.45\nTherefore, the probability that a tablet user answered \"Always,\" given that the tablet user did not answer \"Never,\" is closest to 0.45.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
