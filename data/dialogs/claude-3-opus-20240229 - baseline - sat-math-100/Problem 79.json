This is the initial value or y-intercept of the function.\n2) The helicopter gains altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. This is the rate of change or slope of the function.\n3) In a linear function, the variable t (time in seconds) is multiplied by the rate of change.\n4) The general form of a linear function is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n5) Substituting the values we know:\n   - y-intercept (b) = 40\n   - slope (m) = 21\n   - x variable is t\n6) This gives us the function: y = 21t + 40\nLooking at the choices, the function that matches this is choice B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
