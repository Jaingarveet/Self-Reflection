At these points, y = 0.\n2) To find the x-intercepts, we set f(x) = 0:\n   $x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0$\n3) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n   $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n   where $a=1$, $b=5$, and $c=4$.\n4) Substituting these values:\n   $x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2-4(1)(4)}}{2(1)}$\n      $= \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25-16}}{2}$\n      $= \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{9}}{2}$\n      $= \\frac{-5 \\pm 3}{2}$\n5) This gives us two solutions:\n   $x_1 = \\frac{-5 + 3}{2} = -1$\n   $x_2 = \\frac{-5 - 3}{2} = -4$\n6) The distance between these two x-intercepts is the absolute difference between these values:\n   $|-1 - (-4)| = |-1 + 4| = |3| = 3$\nTherefore, the distance between the x-intercepts is 3.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
