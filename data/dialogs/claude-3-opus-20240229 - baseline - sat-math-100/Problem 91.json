Let's use the points $(1, -2)$ and $(2, 1)$.\n3) Using the point $(1, -2)$:\n   $f(1) = a(1) + b = -2$\n   $a + b = -2$ ... (Equation 1)\n4) Using the point $(2, 1)$:\n   $f(2) = a(2) + b = 1$\n   $2a + b = 1$ ... (Equation 2)\n5) Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n   $(2a + b) - (a + b) = 1 - (-2)$\n   $a = 3$\n6) Substituting $a = 3$ into Equation 1:\n   $3 + b = -2$\n   $b = -5$\n7) Therefore, $f(n) = 3n - 5$\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
