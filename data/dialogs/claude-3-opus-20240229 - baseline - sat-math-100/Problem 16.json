This means that the coordinates $(c, d)$ satisfy the equation of the line. Let's substitute:\n   $d = kc + 4$\n4) Now we can solve for $k$, which is the slope:\n   $d - 4 = kc$\n   $k = \\frac{d - 4}{c}$\n5) Therefore, the slope of the line in terms of $c$ and $d$ is $\\frac{d - 4}{c}$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
