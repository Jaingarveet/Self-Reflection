This is because $(x-a)$ equals 0 when $x=a$.\n2) However, we are given that $p(3) = -2$, not 0. So $x-3$ is not a factor of $p(x)$. This eliminates choices A and B.\n3) Choice C mentions $x+2$ as a factor. But we don't have enough information to determine if this is true or not. The value of $p(-2)$ is not given.\n4) Now, let's consider choice D. When a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x-a)$, the remainder is equal to $p(a)$. \n5) Here, $a=3$, and we're told that $p(3) = -2$. So when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$, the remainder must be -2.\nTherefore, choice D must be true.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
