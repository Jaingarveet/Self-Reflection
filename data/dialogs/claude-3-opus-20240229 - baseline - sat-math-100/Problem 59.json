        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) We're told that there were 310 pollen grains per square centimeter in the first year. This means that when $t = 0$, $P(0) = 310$. This eliminates choices A and B, as they would give $P(0) = 1$.\n2) We're also told that there is a 1% annual increase in the number of grains per square centimeter. This means that each year, the number of grains is multiplied by 1.01 (because a 1% increase means multiplying by 1 + 0.01 = 1.01).\n3) Choice C suggests that each year, the number of grains is multiplied by 0.99. This would represent a 1% decrease each year, not a 1% increase, so this choice is incorrect.\n4) Choice D correctly models the situation. It starts with 310 grains in the first year (when $t = 0$), and then multiplies by 1.01 raised to the power of $t$ for each subsequent year. This correctly models a 1% annual increase.\nTherefore, the correct function is $P(t) = 310(1.01)^t$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
