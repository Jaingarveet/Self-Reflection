Find the number of seniors inducted into the National Honor Society:\n   - 5% of 602 seniors\n   - 0.05 × 602 = 30.1 seniors\n3. Add the number of inducted juniors and seniors:\n   - 39.34 + 30.1 = 69.44 total students\n4. Round 69.44 to the nearest whole number:\n   - 69.44 rounds to 69\nLooking at the choices, the closest number to 69 is choice B, which is 69.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
