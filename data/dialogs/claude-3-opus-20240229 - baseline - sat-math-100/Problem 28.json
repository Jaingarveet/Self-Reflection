This is valid as long as $x \\neq 1$.\n   $\\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1}(x-1) = -2(x-1)$\n3) The $(x-1)$ cancels on the left side:\n   $x^{2}-1 = -2x+2$\n4) Now, let's rearrange the equation to standard form:\n   $x^{2}+2x-3 = 0$\n5) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula: \n   \n   $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-3$.\n6) Substituting these values:\n   $x = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2-4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{16}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 4}{2}$\n7) This gives us two solutions:\n   $x = \\frac{-2 - 4}{2} = -3$ or $x = \\frac{-2 + 4}{2} = 1$\n8) However, remember that $x$ cannot be 1 because that would make the original fraction undefined.\nTherefore, the only solution is $x = -3$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
