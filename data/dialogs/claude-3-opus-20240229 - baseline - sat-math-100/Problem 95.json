This is the form of a linear equation.\n2) In a linear equation, the coefficient of the variable (in this case, 1.88) represents the slope or rate of change. It tells us how much the dependent variable ($H$, height) changes for each one-unit increase in the independent variable ($L$, femur length).\n3) Therefore, 1.88 represents the approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length.\n4) The other choices are incorrect interpretations of the meaning of 1.88 in this context.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
