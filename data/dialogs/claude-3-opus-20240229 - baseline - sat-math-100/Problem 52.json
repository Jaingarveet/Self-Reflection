To find the number of pears produced by Type B trees, we need to work backward from the number of pears produced by Type A trees.\n3. If we consider the number of pears produced by Type B trees as 100%, then Type A trees produce 120% (100% + 20%) of that amount.\n4. Let's say Type B trees produced x pears. Then, Type A trees produced 1.2x pears.\n5. We know that Type A trees produced 144 pears, so we can set up an equation:\n   * 1.2x = 144\n6. Solve the equation for x:\n   * x = 144 รท 1.2\n   * x = 120\nTherefore, Type B trees produced 120 pears.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
