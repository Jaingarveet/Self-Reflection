It tells us how much the dependent variable ($h$, height) changes for each unit increase in the independent variable ($a$, age).\n3) In the given equation, $h=3a+28.6$, the coefficient of $a$ is 3. \n4) This means that for each year increase in age, the height is estimated to increase by 3 inches.\nTherefore, the estimated increase in a boy's height each year is 3 inches.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
