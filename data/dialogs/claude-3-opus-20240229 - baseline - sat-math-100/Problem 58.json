Let's substitute x=0 and y=0 into each inequality:\n   From $y < -x + a$, we get: $0 < -0 + a$, which simplifies to $0 < a$.\n   From $y > x + b$, we get: $0 > 0 + b$, which simplifies to $0 > b$.\n2) So, for (0,0) to be a solution, we must have $a > 0$ and $b < 0$.\n3) Now, let's look at the answer choices:\n   A: $a > b$. This is true, because $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative.\n   B: $b > a$. This is false, because $b$ is negative and $a$ is positive.\n   C: $|a| > |b|$. We don't have enough information to determine this. The inequalities only tell us about the signs of $a$ and $b$, not their magnitudes.\n   D: $a = -b$. This could be true, but it's not necessarily true. For example, $a = 1$ and $b = -2$ would satisfy the conditions, but $a \\neq -b$ in this case.\n4) Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: $a > b$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
