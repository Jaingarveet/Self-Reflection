        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1) Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week.\n2) His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.\n3) Gasoline costs $4 per gallon.\n4) To find his current weekly expenditure on gasoline:\n   - Miles per week / Miles per gallon = Gallons of gasoline used per week\n   - 100 / 25 = 4 gallons per week\n   - Gallons per week * Price per gallon = Weekly expenditure\n   - 4 * $4 = $16 per week\n5) Alan wants to reduce this by $5. So his new weekly expenditure should be:\n   - Current expenditure - Desired reduction = New expenditure\n   - $16 - $5 = $11\n6) Let's say he drives $m$ miles less per week. His new miles per week would be:\n   - Current miles - Reduced miles = New miles per week\n   - 100 - $m$ = New miles per week\n7) With this new mileage, his new weekly expenditure should be $11. We can set up an equation:\n   - (New miles per week / Miles per gallon) * Price per gallon = New expenditure\n   - ((100 - $m$) / 25) * $4 = $11\n8) Simplify:\n   - (100 - $m$) / 25 = 11 / 4\n   - 100 - $m$ = 275 / 4\n   - 100 - $m$ = 68.75\n   - -$m$ = -31.25\n   - $m$ = 31.25\n9) This matches the equation in choice C: $\\frac{4}{25} m = 100 - 11 = 89$, which is approximately 95.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
