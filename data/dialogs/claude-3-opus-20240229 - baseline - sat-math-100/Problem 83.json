This means we need a sample that is representative of all employees.\n2) Option A (selecting one store at random) is not ideal because employee satisfaction may vary significantly from store to store. The selected store may not be representative of all stores.\n3) Option C (surveying the highest and lowest paid employees) is biased. It only considers the extremes and ignores the majority of employees in the middle.\n4) Option D (using a website) is prone to self-selection bias. Only employees who feel strongly (either positively or negatively) may respond.\n5) Option B (selecting 10 employees from each store at random) ensures that all stores are represented, and by selecting employees randomly within each store, it helps ensure a representative sample from each store.\nTherefore, option B is the most appropriate sampling method.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
