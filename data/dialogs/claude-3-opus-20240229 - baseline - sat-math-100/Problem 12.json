        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) Let's define some variables. Let $X_{2010}$ and $X_{2015}$ be the populations of City X in 2010 and 2015 respectively, and let $Y_{2010}$ and $Y_{2015}$ be the populations of City Y in 2010 and 2015 respectively.\n2) We're told that $X_{2010} = 120,000$ and that $X_{2015} = 1.2X_{2010}$ (because of the 20% increase).\n3) So, $X_{2015} = 1.2 \\times 120,000 = 144,000$.\n4) We're also told that in 2015, the populations of City X and City Y were equal. So, $Y_{2015} = X_{2015} = 144,000$.\n5) Now, we need to work backwards to find $Y_{2010}$. We're told that the population of City Y decreased by 10% from 2010 to 2015. In other words, $Y_{2015} = 0.9Y_{2010}$.\n6) Substituting what we know, $144,000 = 0.9Y_{2010}$.\n7) Solving for $Y_{2010}$:\n   $Y_{2010} = 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000$\nTherefore, the population of City Y in 2010 was 160,000.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
