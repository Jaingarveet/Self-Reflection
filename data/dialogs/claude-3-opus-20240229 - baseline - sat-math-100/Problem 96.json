So, the original area is $lw$.\n2) After the alteration, the new length is $1.1l$ (increased by 10%) and the new width is $(1-\\frac{p}{100})w$ (decreased by $p$%). \n3) The new area is $1.1l(1-\\frac{p}{100})w$. \n4) We are told that the new area is 88% of the original area (because it decreased by 12%). So:\n   $1.1l(1-\\frac{p}{100})w = 0.88lw$\n5) Simplifying:\n   $1.1(1-\\frac{p}{100}) = 0.88$\n6) Multiplying out the brackets:\n   $1.1 - 1.1\\frac{p}{100} = 0.88$\n7) Subtracting 1.1 from both sides:\n   $-1.1\\frac{p}{100} = -0.22$\n8) Dividing both sides by -1.1:\n   $\\frac{p}{100} = 0.2$\n9) Multiplying both sides by 100:\n   $p = 20$\nTherefore, the value of $p$ is 20.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
