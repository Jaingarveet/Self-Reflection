This means that for every 7 units we move horizontally (along the x-axis), we move 1 unit vertically (along the y-axis).\n3) Let's check each point:\n   A: (0,7) - This point has the same y-coordinate as the slope (7), but it's not on the line because it doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (0,7) would be a vertical line, not a line with a slope of $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n   B: (1,7) - This point doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (1,7) would mean moving 1 unit horizontally and 7 units vertically, which is a slope of 7, not $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n   C: (7,7) - This point also doesn't follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (7,7) would mean moving 7 units horizontally and 7 units vertically, which is a slope of 1, not $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n   D: (14,2) - This point does follow the slope rule. Moving from (0,0) to (14,2) means moving 14 units horizontally and 2 units vertically. This is equivalent to moving 7 units horizontally and 1 unit vertically twice, which matches the slope of $\\frac{1}{7}$.\n4) Therefore, the point that lies on the line is (14,2).\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
