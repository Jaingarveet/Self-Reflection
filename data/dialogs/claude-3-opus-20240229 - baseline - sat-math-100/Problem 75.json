Let's call this equilibrium price $P_e$.\n2) At equilibrium, $S(P_e) = D(P_e)$. So, we can set up an equation:\n   $\\frac{1}{2} P_e + 40 = 220 - P_e$\n3) Solve for $P_e$:\n   \n   $\\frac{1}{2} P_e + P_e = 220 - 40$\n   \n   $\\frac{3}{2} P_e = 180$\n   \n   $P_e = 120$\n4) Therefore, at a price of $120, the quantity supplied will equal the quantity demanded.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
