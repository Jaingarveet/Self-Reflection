This means that after 20 years, the population will be 90 percent of what it was before.\n\nTo represent this mathematically, we can use the formula for exponential decay:\n\n$P(t) = P\\_0 (1 - r)^{t/k}$\n\nwhere $P(t)$ is the population at time $t$, $P\\_0$ is the initial population, $r$ is the rate of decay (as a decimal), and $k$ is the time period over which the decay occurs.\n\nIn this case, $P\\_0 = 50,000$, $r = 0.1$, and $k = 20$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$P(t) = 50,000 (1 - 0.1)^{t/20}$\n\n$P(t) = 50,000 (0.9)^{t/20}$\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
