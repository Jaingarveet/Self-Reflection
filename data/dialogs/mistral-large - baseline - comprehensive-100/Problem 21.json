The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.\n  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.\n  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.\n  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.\n  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.\n"

This cannot be true because Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 2.\nB: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. This cannot be true because Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 7.\nC: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. This cannot be true because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.\nD: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. This could be true because it does not violate any of the given conditions.\nE: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. This could be true because it does not violate any of the given conditions.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\") or Answer(\"E\")\n\nHowever, since the question asks for only one answer, we need to determine which of the two remaining choices is more likely to be true. Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, it is more likely that they will be featured on day 5 than on day 6, since they cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
