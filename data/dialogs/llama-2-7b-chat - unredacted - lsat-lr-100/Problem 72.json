        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Seemingly inconsequential changes in sea temperature due to global warming eventually result in declines in fish and seabird populations. A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata. This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton. Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton?\nChoices:\n  A: It is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients.\n  B: It is intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits.\n  C: It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly.\n  D: It is offered as one reason that global warming must be curtailed.\n  E: It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nThank you for providing the reflection and correction. Here's the analysis of the mistake and the correct answer:\n\nMistake:\nThe mistake was in understanding the role of the statement \"Zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton\" in the argument. You incorrectly selected option (A) as the best answer, which suggests that the statement is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients. However, the passage actually uses this statement to illustrate how global warming affects the food chain in the ocean, by showing how the restricted availability of upwelling nutrients due to a rise in sea temperature impacts phytoplankton populations and, in turn, zooplankton populations.\n\nCorrect Answer:\nThe correct answer is option (E), which states that the statement \"Zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton\" is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms. This is because the passage suggests that the decline in phytoplankton populations due to the restricted availability of upwelling nutrients has a cascading effect on the rest of the food chain, including larger sea animals, which are ultimately affected by the decline in zooplankton populations. Therefore, the statement \"Zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton\" helps to illustrate the broader impact of global warming on the ocean ecosystem and all organisms that depend on it.\n"
