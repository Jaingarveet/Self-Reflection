Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose \"unyielding,\" because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?\nChoices:\n  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact\n  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives\n  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nMy apologies, thank you for pointing that out!

The correct answer is indeed (E) conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion.\n\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\n\nThe argumentative technique employed in the passage is a form of conditional advocacy, where the author is arguing for a particular factic (i.e., that the accused person has not yielded) in order to make an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives. The author acknowledges that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question (B), but argues that it is the best option available because it allows the author to make an accusation that is less abusive than other alternatives (A and D).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I hope this revised answer is more accurate."
