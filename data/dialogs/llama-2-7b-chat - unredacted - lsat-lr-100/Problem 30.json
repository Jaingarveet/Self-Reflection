So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile.\nQuestion: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether\nChoices:\n  A: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income\n  B: change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile\n  C: changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile\n  D: there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered\n  E: the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nLarew and Mendota are debating whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile can be accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Mendota argues that while the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the context of the problem\n* Misinterpreting the information provided\n* Failing to consider all the relevant factors\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided and consider the context of the problem. The correct answer is (A) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. This is because the percentage change in average income provides a more accurate measure of the relative change in economic prosperity between the two groups, rather than just looking at the absolute amount of the increase in average income.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key points of contention between Larew and Mendota.\n2. Analyze the information provided and consider the context of the problem.\n3. Evaluate the arguments presented by both Larew and Mendota and determine which one is more persuasive.\n4. Choose the answer that best reflects the correct solution to the problem.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and identify the key points of contention between the two perspectives.\n* Analyze the information provided and consider the context of the problem before making a decision.\n* Evaluate the arguments presented by both perspectives and determine which one is more persuasive.\n* Always choose the answer that best reflects the correct solution to the problem.\n* Remember to consider all the relevant factors and avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\n"

Mendota argues that while the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile. However, this does not necessarily mean that the highest quintile has experienced more economic prosperity than the lowest quintile.\n\nTo accurately measure the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest, we need to compare their percentage changes in average income. This is because the percentage change in average income provides a more accurate measure of the relative change in economic prosperity between the two groups, rather than just looking at the absolute amount of the increase in average income.\n\nFor example, if the average income of the lowest quintile increased by 10% over a decade, while the average income of the highest quintile increased by 20%, the relative change in economic prosperity of the lowest quintile is greater than that of the highest quintile, even though the absolute increase in average income is higher for the highest quintile. Therefore, (A) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income."
