Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\nQuestion: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.\n  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.\n  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (C) There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe statement \"Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection\" is false, as the statement mentions that prints of works not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, are also sold in the museum store.\n\nThe statement \"Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work\" is also false, as the statement mentions that prints of works not part of the twentieth century, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, are sold in the museum store.\n\nThe statement \"There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector\" is true, as the information provided states that the museum store sells prints of works that are not part of the permanent collection, including Hopper's Nighthawks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n"
