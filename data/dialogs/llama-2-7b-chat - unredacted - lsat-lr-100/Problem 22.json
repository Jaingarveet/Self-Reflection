        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In his book, published in 1892, Grey used the same metaphor that Jordan used in her book, which was published in 1885. The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.\n  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.\n  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (A) A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n\nThe passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book, which weakens the argument that Grey must have read Jordan's book. However, the presence of the same unusual metaphor in a text known to both Jordan and Grey suggests that it is more likely that Grey was influenced by this earlier text rather than Jordan's book.\n\nHere are the reasons why the other options do not weaken the argument:\n\n* Option (B) does not necessarily imply that the metaphor used by Grey is unrelated to the ideas expressed in Jordan's book. It only suggests that the idea expressed in Grey's book is different from the ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n* Option (C) does not affect the argument as both books were written for the same audience.\n* Option (D) is irrelevant as there is no information provided about Jordan's use of the metaphor in her book in 1894 and 1895.\n* Option (E) is also irrelevant as it does not address the issue of whether Grey read Jordan's book or not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n"
