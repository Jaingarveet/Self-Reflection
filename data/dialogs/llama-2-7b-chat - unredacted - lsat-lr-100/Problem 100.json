Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nMy apologies, you are correct. Here is my answer in the correct format:\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nThe correct answer is (A): In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes. This choice suggests that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, as they have mandated the same penalty for both crimes.\n"

Here's a breakdown of your thought process:\n\nThought: You recognized that the question is asking for the argument's strengthener and not the argument itself. You also realized that the argument is based on the assumption that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\n\nAction: You selected option A, which states that in general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes. This choice supports the argument that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, as they have mandated the same penalty for both crimes.\n\nExplanation: By selecting option A, you have provided evidence that supports the argument that lawmakers in those jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery. This choice suggests that lawmakers in those jurisdictions have a consistent approach to sentencing, where they consider the harm resulting from both crimes to be equal when determining the appropriate penalty.\n\nWell done! Your self-reflection and ability to apply the correct format for answering the question demonstrate your understanding of the topic and your ability to think critically. Keep up the good work!"
