Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\n\nThought:\nIf M is the only chemist selected, then both P and R must be selected (since the rule states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected).\nSince at least one scientist of each type must be selected, at least one botanist must be selected.\nHowever, since more than one botanist cannot be selected if only one zoologist is selected, only one botanist can be selected.\nTherefore, the panel must consist of M (chemist), one botanist, and P and R (zoologists).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
