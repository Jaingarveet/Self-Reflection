Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the second day.\n  C: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  D: Yuki tests H on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the conditions given:\n\n1. Reynaldo cannot test F.\n2. Yuki cannot test J.\n3. Theresa must be one of the testers for H.\n4. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nNow let's consider each choice:\n\nA: Reynaldo tests J on the first day. This does not violate any conditions.\nB: Reynaldo tests J on the second day. This does not violate any conditions.\nC: Seamus tests H on the first day. This violates condition 3, as Theresa must test H.\nD: Yuki tests H on the first day. This does not violate any conditions.\nE: Yuki tests H on the second day.
