The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\n\nThought:\nThe bay holding produce is bay 4.\nThe bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so it must be either bay 3 or bay 5.\nIf the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.\nIf the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.\nIn either case, the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 6.\nTherefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding (produce) is completely determined, and the type of cargo that either bay 3 or bay 5 is holding (textiles) is also completely determined.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
