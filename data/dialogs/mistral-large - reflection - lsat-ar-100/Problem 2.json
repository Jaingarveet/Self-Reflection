Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?\nChoices:\n  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.\n  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\n  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.\n\nThought:\nThe constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants.\nOption A does not guarantee that there will be at least two businesses between the two restaurants.\nOption B does not guarantee that there will be at least two businesses between the two restaurants.\nOption C guarantees that there will be at least one business between the two restaurants, but not necessarily two.\nOption D does not guarantee that there will be at least two businesses between the two restaurants.\nOption E is irrelevant to the constraint in question.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Carefully read and understand the original constraint.\n2. Consider the implications of the constraint on the arrangement of the businesses.\n3. Carefully read and understand each answer choice.\n4. Consider the implications of each answer choice on the arrangement of the businesses.\n5. Compare the implications of each answer choice to the implications of the original constraint.\n6.
