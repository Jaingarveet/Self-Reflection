Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\n\nThought:\nFrom the given conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\nWe also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies both conditions is B: Kramer, O'Neill.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nFrom condition 3, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\nFrom condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nHowever, this condition does not mean that only two students can review the same play. It means that two students can review the same set of plays.\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all conditions is D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given conditions and interpret them correctly.\n3. List the possible options for the students who review Tamerlane.\n4. Evaluate each option against the given conditions.\n5. Eliminate the options that do not satisfy all conditions.\n6. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always interpret the given conditions correctly.\n - Always evaluate each option against all conditions.\n - Never make assumptions about the conditions.\n - Always double-check your answer against all conditions.\n - Remember that two students can review the same set of plays, not just the same play."
