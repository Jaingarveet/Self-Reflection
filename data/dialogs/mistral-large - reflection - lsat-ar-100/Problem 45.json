        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  B: Image's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.\n\nThought:\nSince Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, Truvest's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days.\nSince Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target must be 1 day.\nSince Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.\nSince none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be 1 day.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
