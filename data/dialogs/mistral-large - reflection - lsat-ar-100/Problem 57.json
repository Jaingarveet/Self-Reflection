Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?\nChoices:\n  A: George and Lenore\n  B: Helen and Nina\n  C: Irving and Robert\n  D: Kyle and Nina\n  E: Olivia and Kyle\n\nThought:\nIf Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but George must also give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible.\nIf Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but George cannot give a report on Wednesday, which is not possible.\nTherefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.\nIf Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia cannot give a report on Wednesday, which is not possible.\nTherefore, Kyle cannot give a report on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
