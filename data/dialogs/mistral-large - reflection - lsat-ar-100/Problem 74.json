The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  B: Jaramillo and Ong\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Ong\n\nThought:\nThe question asks for the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships.\nWe know that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\nIf Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\nIf Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\nIf Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nBased on these constraints, we can eliminate some options:\n\n* A: Jaramillo and Novetzke cannot be the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships because if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned.\n* B: Jaramillo and Ong cannot be the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships because if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.\n* C: Kayne and Landon cannot be the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships because if Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne can still be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen.\n* D: Kayne and Novetzke cannot be the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships because either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n* E: Landon and Ong could be the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships because if Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela, and if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Landon cannot be assigned to Zambia.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
