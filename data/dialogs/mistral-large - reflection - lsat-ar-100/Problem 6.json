The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\n\nThought:\nFrom the given conditions, we can deduce that:\n\n* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review all three plays.\n* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review only one play, and it cannot be Tamerlane (since Megregian reviews all three plays).\n* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they each review at least one play.\n* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since Megregian reviews all three plays, this means that either Kramer or O'Neill must also review all three plays.\n\nFrom these deductions, we can see that:\n\n* Jiang reviews only one play, so A must be true.\n* Megregian reviews all three plays, so B must be true.\n* O'Neill reviews at least one play, but we don't know if he reviews more than one, so we can't determine if C is true.\n* We don't know how many plays O'Neill reviews, so we can't determine if D is true.\n* Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so E must be true.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
