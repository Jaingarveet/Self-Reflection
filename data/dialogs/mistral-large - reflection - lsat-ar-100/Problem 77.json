        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the rules given:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nFrom rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the four lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the three remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).\n\nNow, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the two remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nTogowa is limited to two possible spaces (#1 or #2), and Young is limited to two possible spaces (#2 or #3) after considering Togowa's limitation. Therefore, two employees have their parking space assignment limited to only two possible spaces.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nFrom rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the four lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the three remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).\n\nNow, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the two remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).\n\nHowever, we must also consider rule 2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. Since Robertson can only occupy one of the four lower-numbered spaces, and Young and Togowa must occupy two of the remaining three lower-numbered spaces, Souza can only be assigned the remaining lower-numbered space (#1, #2, or #3). This means that Xu can only be assigned one of the two remaining higher-numbered spaces (#5 or #6).\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Analyze each rule given in the problem.\n3. Consider the implications of each rule on the possible assignments.\n4. Identify the employees whose assignments are limited to only two possible spaces.\n5. Count the number of employees with such limitations.\n6. Double-check your analysis and calculations.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always analyze each rule given in the problem.\n - Always consider the implications of each rule on the possible assignments.\n - Never stop your analysis too early; consider all rules and their implications.\n - Always double-check your analysis and calculations.\n - Remember that logical reasoning and analysis are crucial in solving complex problems."
