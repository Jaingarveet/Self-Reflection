Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the bay holding livestock?\nChoices:\n  A: bay 1\n  B: bay 2\n  C: bay 3\n  D: bay 5\n  E: bay 6\n\nThought:\nThe bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 1 or bay 6.\nThe bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 5.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
