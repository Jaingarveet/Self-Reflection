Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be false?\nChoices:\n  A: The bay holding fuel is next to the bay holding machinery.\n  B: The bay holding grain is next to the bay holding machinery.\n  C: The bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel.\n  D: The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.\n  E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.\n\nThought:\nThe bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, the bay holding textiles cannot be next to the bay holding fuel.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
