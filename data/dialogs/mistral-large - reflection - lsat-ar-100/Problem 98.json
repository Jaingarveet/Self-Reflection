The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.\n  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.\n  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.\n  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is\n  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is\n\nThought:\nThe first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, but J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house.\nK cannot be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house either.\nL must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first house.\nTherefore, the first two houses must be chosen from L, M, N, O, and P.\nSince J must be shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house.\nIf J is the sixth house, then K, L, M, N, and O must be shown before it, but this is not possible since L must be shown after K and before M.\nTherefore, J must be the seventh house, and K, L, M, N, O, and P must be shown before it.\nSince L must be shown after K and before M, K cannot be the last house shown before J, so it must be one of the first five houses.\nTherefore, K could be shown at some time after J is shown if it is the fifth house shown.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
