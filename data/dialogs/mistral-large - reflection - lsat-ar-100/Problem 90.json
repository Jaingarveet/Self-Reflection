        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?\nChoices:\n  A: a 1-day website target\n  B: a 2-day voicemail target\n  C: a 2-day website target\n  D: a 3-day voicemail target\n  E: a 3-day website target\n\nThought:\nThe question asks which target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.\nAccording to the conditions, none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, if one client has a 1-day website target, the other clients cannot have a 1-day website target because their voicemail targets would have to be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
