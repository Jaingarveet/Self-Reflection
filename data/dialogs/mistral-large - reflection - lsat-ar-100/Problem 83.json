        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\n\nThought:\nJulio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.\nKevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Rebecca must also lead a morning session.\nLan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\nNessa must lead an afternoon session.\nJulio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nExplanation:\nIf Olivia's session meets on Friday morning, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning. However, since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and they both lead morning sessions, there is no available morning session for Olivia to lead on Wednesday or Thursday. Therefore, Olivia cannot lead a session on Friday morning.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
