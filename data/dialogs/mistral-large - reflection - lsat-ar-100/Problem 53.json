The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown in the evening.\n  B: L is shown in the afternoon.\n  C: L is shown in the evening.\n  D: M is shown in the morning.\n  E: M is shown in the afternoon.\n\nThought:\nThe first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, but K cannot be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house.\nL must be shown after K, so L cannot be the first house either.\nJ must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.\nSince J is shown in the evening, it must be either the sixth or seventh house.\nSince K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.\nSince L must be shown after K, it must also be shown in the afternoon or evening.\nSince L must be shown before M, M cannot be shown before L.\nTherefore, M cannot be shown in the morning, and it must be shown after L.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
