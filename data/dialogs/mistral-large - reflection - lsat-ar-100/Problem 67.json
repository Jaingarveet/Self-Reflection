Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\n  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.\n  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.\n  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\n\nThought:\nSince no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the nine batches must be distributed among the other four days.\nMonday cannot have only one batch because that would leave 8 batches for 3 days, which is not possible since at most 2 batches can be made per day.\nTherefore, Monday must have at least two batches.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
