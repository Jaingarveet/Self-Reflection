K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\n\nThought:\nMore books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.\nF and M are placed on the same shelf, so they cannot be the only books on the bottom shelf.\nK is placed on a higher shelf than F, so F cannot be on the bottom shelf.\nO is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the bottom shelf.\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
