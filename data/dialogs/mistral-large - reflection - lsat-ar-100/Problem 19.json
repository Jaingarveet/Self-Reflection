Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nThought:\nSince Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report.

Therefore, she must give her report on Monday afternoon.\nSince Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday (which it is not).\nSince Helen gives a morning report, she must give her report on Tuesday morning.\nSince Irving must give a report on Tuesday and cannot give an afternoon report, he must give the morning report on Tuesday.\nSince Kyle gives a morning report and cannot give a report on Tuesday (since both morning and afternoon reports are taken), he must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.\nSince Helen gives a report on Tuesday, Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday.

However, the question does not specify that each student can only give one report.\nI also made an incorrect assumption about the order of the reports based on Nina's report. I assumed that since Nina gives an afternoon report, she cannot give a report on Wednesday. However, the question states that Nina cannot give an afternoon report on Wednesday, not that she cannot give a report at all on Wednesday.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in law but in reading comprehension and logical reasoning.\nI did not carefully read and interpret the conditions of the problem.\nI made assumptions that were not supported by the information given.\nI did not consider all possible scenarios.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Reading comprehension error\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Misinterpretation of conditions\nSolution:\nSince Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report on the same day.\nSince George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.\nSince Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, Nina must give the other afternoon report.\nSince Nina gives an afternoon report, she cannot give a report on Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, she must give her report on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.\nIf Nina gives her report on Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
