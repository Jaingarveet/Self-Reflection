        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\n\nThought:\nSince Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.\nSince none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must be 1 day as well.\nSince Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, Solide's website target can be 1 day or 2 days, and Truvest's website target can be 2 days or 3 days.\nSince Solide's voicemail target cannot be shorter than Image's voicemail target, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days or 3 days.\nSince Truvest's voicemail target cannot be shorter than Image's voicemail target, Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days or 3 days.\nTherefore, the only option that cannot be true is \"C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\"\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
