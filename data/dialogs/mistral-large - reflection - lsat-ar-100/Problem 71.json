Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\n\nThought:\nSince Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, they cannot all be in Zone 3 because there are only seven sales representatives in total.\nSince there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, Tiao must work in Zone 3.\nSince Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and Tiao works in Zone 3, Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3.\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
