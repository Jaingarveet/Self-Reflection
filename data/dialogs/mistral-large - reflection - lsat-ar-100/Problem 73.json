The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\n\nThought:\nWe know that exactly three of the students review Undulation. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must be one of the three students who review Undulation. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot both review Undulation as well, since they each review fewer plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must be the third student who reviews Undulation.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
