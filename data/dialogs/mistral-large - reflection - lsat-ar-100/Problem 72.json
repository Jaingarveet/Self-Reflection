Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be\nChoices:\n  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant\n  B: the pharmacy and the toy store\n  C: the two restaurants\n  D: a restaurant and the toy store\n  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian\n\nThought:\nThe pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nIf the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian.\n\nSince the pharmacy is at one end of the row, the restaurant at the other end of the row cannot be next to the optometrist and shoe store pair. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
