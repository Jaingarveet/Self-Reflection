Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the conditions given:\n\n1.

Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nNow let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n\n* This choice satisfies all conditions.\n\nB: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n\n* This choice violates condition 3 (Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other).\n\nC: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n\n* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).\n\nD: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n\n* This choice violates condition 2 (Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2) and condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).\n\nE: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\n\n* This choice violates condition 5 (There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2).\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
