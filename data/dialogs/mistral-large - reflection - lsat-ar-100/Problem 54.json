The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n\nThought:\nSince Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.\nSince neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, they cannot review the play Jiang reviews.\nSince Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.\nSince exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian cannot review Tamerlane.\nTherefore, Megregian must review Sunset and Undulation.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
