Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If G is fourth, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fifth.\n  B: J is first.\n  C: Q is second.\n  D: S is fifth\n  E: Y is sixth.\n\nThought:\nIf G is fourth, then J must be earlier than G, so J can be first, second, or third.\nIf J is first, then the second article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the second article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the second article cannot be Y. Therefore, the second article must be Q.\nIf J is second, then the first article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y.
