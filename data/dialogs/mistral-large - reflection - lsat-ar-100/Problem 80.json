Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\n\nThought:\nYoung must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\nXu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nRobertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\nRobertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nOption A: Young is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the first rule.\nOption B: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Robertson's parking space is not #1, #2, #3, or #4, which violates the fourth rule.\nOption C: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the second rule.\nOption D: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and all other rules are satisfied.\nOption E: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the second rule.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
