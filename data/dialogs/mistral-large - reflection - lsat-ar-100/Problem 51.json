Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a possible assignment of riders to bicycles, with the riders for each bicycle listed in the order in which they test the bicycle?\nChoices:\n  A: F: Seamus, Reynaldo; G: Yuki, Seamus; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n  B: F: Seamus, Yuki; G: Reynaldo, Theresa; H: Yuki, Seamus; J: Theresa, Reynaldo\n  C: F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Seamus, Reynaldo; H: Theresa, Yuki; J: Reynaldo, Theresa\n  D: F: Yuki, Seamus; G: Theresa, Reynaldo; H: Reynaldo, Theresa; J: Seamus, Yuki\n  E: F: Yuki, Theresa; G: Seamus, Yuki; H: Theresa, Reynaldo; J: Reynaldo, Seamus\n\nThought:\nReynaldo cannot test F, so choices A, B, and E can be eliminated.\nYuki cannot test J, so choice D can be eliminated.\nTheresa must be one of the testers for H, so choice C can be eliminated.\nThe bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so choice E can be eliminated.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

Read the question carefully and understand the conditions given.\n2. Eliminate choices that violate the conditions.\n3. Identify the possible assignments of riders to bicycles based on the remaining choices.\n4. Apply the conditions to each possible assignment to determine the correct answer.\n5.

Choose the answer that matches your determined assignment.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions given.\n - Always eliminate choices that violate the conditions.\n - Always apply the conditions to each possible assignment to determine the correct answer.\n - Never assume that a condition applies to both days unless it is explicitly stated.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and the conditions to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the conditions may limit the possible assignments of riders to bicycles."
