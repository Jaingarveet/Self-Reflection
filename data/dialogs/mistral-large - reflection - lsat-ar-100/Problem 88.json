At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nThought:\nWe know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and at least two books are placed on each shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we can assume that there are at least two books on the middle shelf.\n\nIf K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then K and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the top shelf.\n\nSince F is placed on the same shelf as M, and I is already on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nNow we have:\nTop shelf: K, O\nMiddle shelf: I\nBottom shelf: F, M\n\nWe still need to place G and H, and we know that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we can assume that there are at least two books on the middle shelf.\nIf K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then K and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the top shelf.\nSince F is placed on the same shelf as M, and I is already on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf.

Therefore, G and H cannot both be placed on the top shelf.\nIf A is true, then I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. Since I is already on the middle shelf, M must also be placed on the middle shelf. This means that F cannot be placed on the middle shelf, so it must be placed on the bottom shelf. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, M must also be placed on the bottom shelf. This means that there are now three books on the bottom shelf (F, M, and either G or H), which satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, A is the correct answer.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.\n3. Consider all possible scenarios based on the given conditions.\n4. Use logical reasoning to determine the placement of each book.\n5. Double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n6.
