The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: F, H, P\n  B: H, P. L\n  C: O, P, R\n  D: O, P, T\n  E: P, R, T\n\nThought:\nIf S is performed fourth, then O cannot be performed first or fifth, so O must be performed either second or third.\nIf O is performed second, then P cannot be performed first, so P must be performed third.
