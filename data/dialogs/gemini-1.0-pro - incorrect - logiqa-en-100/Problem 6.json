We only know that they didn't go to I Peak, not that they went to E city instead of F city.\nC: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain: This violates condition (2). If they didn't go to E city, they can't go to G lake. So, this is not true.\nD: The group went to F city and G lake tour: This could be true. They could have gone to F city and G lake without going to I Peak. This satisfies all the conditions.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
