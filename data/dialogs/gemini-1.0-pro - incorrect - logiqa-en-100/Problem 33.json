This would reduce the total number of people by 1, making it consistent with the question stem.\n* **B:** The products of one of the entrepreneurs are mainly exported to the United States. This does not affect the total number of people.\n* **C:** Two entrepreneurs are Chinese, and another American is a lawyer. This does not affect the total number of people.\n* **D:** One of the lawyers is the legal adviser of one of the entrepreneurs. This does not affect the total number of people.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only choice that explains the inconsistency is **A**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
