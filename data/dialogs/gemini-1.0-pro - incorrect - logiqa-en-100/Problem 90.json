The country may be able to find ways to achieve both goals, such as by investing in education and training to improve the skills of its workforce.\n* **B**: This is a possible solution, but it may not be the best one. Reducing social insurance premiums could lead to lower quality of life for workers and their families.\n* **C**: This is too extreme. The country may be able to find a balance between economic development and social stability.\n* **D**: This is the most likely outcome. The country will need to find ways to mitigate the negative impact of social insurance premiums on its competitiveness.\nTherefore, the best answer is **D**.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
