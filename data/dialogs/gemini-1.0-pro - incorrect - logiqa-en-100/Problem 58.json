It ignores other potential factors, such as rising land prices, speculation, and government policies.\n**Key Takeaways:**\n* Not all opinions are equally valid.\n* When evaluating statements, it is important to consider the evidence that supports them.\n* Simple explanations are not always the most accurate.\n## Applying the Takeaways to the Current Question\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A:** This statement provides evidence that land prices are rising, which supports the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.\n* **B:** This statement also provides evidence that land prices are rising, but to a lesser extent than in Shanghai.\n* **C:** This statement is an opinion from a real estate chairman. While opinions from experts can be valuable, they should not be taken as definitive proof.\n* **D:** This statement is a simplistic explanation that ignores other potential factors.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the most doubtful statement is **D**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
