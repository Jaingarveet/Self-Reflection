Sales could be above R&D with other departments in between.\n**B: Sales is one level above Administration:** This is also possible. Sales could be on the floor above Administration with other departments in between.\n**C: Sales is next to Planning:** This contradicts the information that Human Resources and Sales are not adjacent. \n**D: Sales is on the second floor:** This is possible, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, options A, B, and D are all possible scenarios.
