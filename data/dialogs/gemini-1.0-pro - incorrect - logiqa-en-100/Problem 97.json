However, this conclusion could be weakened if there are other factors that could explain the increase.\nChoice A: This statement suggests that negative news has always been more prevalent than positive news. This could explain why there are more posts about negative topics now, even if the social atmosphere is not actually deteriorating.\nChoice B: This statement suggests that the increase in negative posts could be due to the increase in the number of internet users, rather than a change in the social atmosphere.\nChoice C: This statement suggests that some of the negative posts may be motivated by profit, rather than a genuine concern about social issues. This could also explain the increase in negative posts.\nChoice D: This statement is irrelevant to the argument.\nTherefore, the answer that would most weaken the argument is **B: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years**.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
