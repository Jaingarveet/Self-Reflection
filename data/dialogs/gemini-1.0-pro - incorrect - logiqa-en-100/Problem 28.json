This leaves one slot open.\n        * If K participates, then G cannot participate due to the condition \"If J participates, then G participates.\" This also leaves one slot open.\n* Combining the scenarios:\n    * If E and J participate, then G must also participate. This leaves one slot open, which can be filled by either H or M.\n    * If F and K participate, then G cannot participate. This leaves two slots open, which can be filled by H and M.\n* Therefore, the only two players who are guaranteed to be selected are G and J, regardless of the specific choices made for E/F and H/M.\n**Key takeaways from this reflection:**\n* Pay close attention to conditional statements and how they interact with each other.\n* Consider all possible scenarios and their implications before making a final decision.\n* Double-check the answer against all the given conditions to ensure it satisfies them all.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\") \n"
