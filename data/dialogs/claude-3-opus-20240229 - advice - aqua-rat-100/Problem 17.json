        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Understand the given information:\n   * The company produces 420 components per month\n   * The production cost per component is $110\n   * The company wants a minimum yearly profit of $626,400\n2. Calculate the yearly production:\n   * Monthly production = 420 components\n   * Yearly production = 420 × 12 = 5,040 components\n3. Calculate the yearly production cost:\n   * Production cost per component = $110\n   * Yearly production cost = 5,040 × $110 = $554,400\n4. Calculate the minimum yearly revenue needed to achieve the desired profit:\n   * Minimum yearly profit = $626,400\n   * Minimum yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Minimum yearly profit\n   * Minimum yearly revenue = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800\n5. Calculate the minimum selling price per component:\n   * Minimum yearly revenue = $1,180,800\n   * Yearly production = 5,040 components\n   * Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 ÷ 5,040 = $234.29\n6. Compare the calculated minimum selling price to the given options:\n   * The calculated price of $234.29 is not an exact match for any option\n   * The nearest option that guarantees the desired yearly profit is $240\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
