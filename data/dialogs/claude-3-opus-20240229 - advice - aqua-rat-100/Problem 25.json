        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the first instance be x.\n2. At 45° angle of elevation:\n   tan(45°) = h/x\n   1 = h/x\n   x = h\n3. After 10 minutes at 60° angle of elevation:\n   tan(60°) = h/(x-d), where d is distance traveled in 10 min\n   √3 = h/(x-d)\n   √3(x-d) = h\n   √3x - √3d = h\n   \n4. From (2), h = x\n   Substituting in (3):\n   √3x - √3d = x\n   √3x - x = √3d\n   x(√3 - 1) = √3d\n   x = √3d/(√3 - 1)\n5. Let the remaining time to reach the tower be t.\n   Then, x = speed * t\n        √3d/(√3 - 1) = d/10 * t\n        10√3/(√3 - 1) = t\n6. Simplify:\n   10√3/(√3 - 1) * (√3 + 1)/(√3 + 1)\n   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))\n   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/(3 - 1)\n   = (10√3(√3 + 1))/2\n   = 5√3(√3 + 1)\n   = 5(3 + √3)\n   = 15 + 5√3\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 15 + 5√3 minutes more.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
