        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. First, let's consider how many total ways there are to arrange 3 children on 3 chairs, without any restrictions. This would be 3! = 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 ways.\n2. Now, we need to apply the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. This means Susan and Tim can't swap positions. \n3. If we fix Susan and Tim's relative positions, there are 2 possibilities:\n   - Susan, Tim, Zen\n   - Susan, Zen, Tim\n4. In each of these 2 arrangements, the 3rd person (Zen) can be placed in the remaining spot, which is already determined.\n5. So with the condition \"Susan is on the left of Tim\", there are only 2 possible arrangements in total.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 2 ways.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
