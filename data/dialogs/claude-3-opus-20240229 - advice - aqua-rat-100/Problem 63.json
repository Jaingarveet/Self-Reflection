Then the number of matches lost is 0.3x (30% of x)\n5. We can set up an equation: x = 20 + 0.3x\n6. Solving for x:\n   0.7x = 20\n   x = 20/0.7 ≈ 28.57\n7. So the total number of matches is approximately 29 (rounding to the nearest whole number since a match cannot be fractional).\n8. The number of matches lost is then 0.3 * 29 ≈ 8.7\n9. Rounding 8.7 to the nearest whole number gives 9.\nLooking at the available choices, 9 matches lost is not an option. The closest available answer is 7.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
