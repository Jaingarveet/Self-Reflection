        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let's define the variables:\n   - Let x be the number of matches played before the final.\n   - Sachin's current batting average is 51.\n   - In the final match, he scores 78 runs.\n   - After the final, his batting average becomes 54.\n2. We can set up an equation based on the definition of batting average:\n   - Batting average = Total runs scored / Number of matches played\n   - So, 51 = Total runs before final / x\n   - And, 54 = (Total runs before final + 78) / (x + 1)\n3. From the first equation, we can find the total runs before the final:\n   - Total runs before final = 51 * x\n4. Substituting this into the second equation:\n   - 54 = (51x + 78) / (x + 1)\n5. Solving for x:\n   - 54(x + 1) = 51x + 78\n   - 54x + 54 = 51x + 78\n   - 3x = 24\n   - x = 8\n6. So, before the final, Sachin played 8 matches. Adding the final match makes it a total of 9 matches.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
