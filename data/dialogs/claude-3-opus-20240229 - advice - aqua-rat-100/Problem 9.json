To calculate the profit per bag:\n   25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25 profit per bag\n4. The total profit is $3,000. To find the number of bags sold, divide the total profit by the profit per bag:\n   $3,000 / $25 per bag = 120 bags\nHowever, 120 is not one of the available answer choices. The closest option is 120 bags.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
