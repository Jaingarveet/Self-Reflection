        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) First, let's simplify the expression for x:\nx = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8√n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n(n + 2√n) + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = (n^2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n  = n + 2√n + 8 + 16/(n + 4√n + 4)\n2) Now, let's consider the bounds for n: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72\n3) When n = 36:\nx = 36 + 2√36 + 8 + 16/(36 + 4√36 + 4)\n  ≈ 36 + 12 + 8 + 16/56\n  ≈ 56.29\n4) When n = 72:\nx = 72 + 2√72 + 8 + 16/(72 + 4√72 + 4)\n  ≈ 72 + 16.97 + 8 + 16/105\n  ≈ 97.12\n5) So, the range of x is approximately 56.29 < x < 97.12\n6) Comparing this to the given choices, the only one that fits is:\n   C: 25 < x < 64\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
