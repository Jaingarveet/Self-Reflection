        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. Let's call this his normal speed.\n2. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current's speed is the difference between his normal speed and his speed against the current. \n   Current speed = Normal speed - Speed against current\n                 = 4 kmph - 2 kmph \n                 = 2 kmph\n3. When rowing along the current, the man's speed will be his normal speed plus the current's speed.\n   Speed along current = Normal speed + Current speed\n                       = 4 kmph + 2 kmph\n                       = 6 kmph\n4. Looking at the answer choices, both B and E match this speed of 6 kmph.\nTherefore, the correct answers are B and E. The man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") and Answer(\"E\")"
