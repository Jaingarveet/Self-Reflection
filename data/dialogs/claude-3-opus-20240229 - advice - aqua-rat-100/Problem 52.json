        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Alloy X has a zinc to copper ratio of 6:9. \n   In 40g of alloy X, there is:\n   Zinc = 40 * (6/15) = 16g\n   Copper = 40 * (9/15) = 24g\n2. Alloy Y has a zinc to copper ratio of 7:11.\n   In 60g of alloy Y, there is: \n   Zinc = 60 * (7/18) = 23.33g\n   Copper = 60 * (11/18) = 36.67g\n3. In the 100g mixture of alloy Z, there is:\n   Total Zinc = 16g + 23.33g = 39.33g\n   Total Copper = 24g + 36.67g = 60.67g\n4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n   39.33 : 60.67\n   \n5. Simplifying this ratio:\n   39.33/39.33 : 60.67/39.33 = 1 : 1.54\n   Multiplying by 59 to match the answer choices:\n   59 : 91\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 59:91.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
