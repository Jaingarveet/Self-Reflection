From the given conditions, we can write two equations:\n   - If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. \n     Equation 1: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)\n   - If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.\n     Equation 2: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)\n3. Simplify Equation 1:\n   y + 30 = 2(x - 30)\n   y + 30 = 2x - 60\n   y = 2x - 90\n4. Substitute y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   x + 10 = 3((2x - 90) - 10)\n   x + 10 = 3(2x - 100)\n   x + 10 = 6x - 300\n5. Solve for x:\n   x + 10 = 6x - 300\n   -5x = -310\n   x = 62\n6. Substitute x = 62 into y = 2x - 90:\n   y = 2(62) - 90\n   y = 124 - 90\n   y = 34\nTherefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
