        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. There are x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide\n2. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets\n3. Since there are x pickets, there must be x-1 spaces between the pickets\nNow let's calculate the total length:\n4. Total width of pickets = x * 1/2 inch = x/2 inches\n5. Total width of spaces = (x-1) * 6 inches = 6x - 6 inches\n6. Total length = width of pickets + width of spaces\n   = x/2 + 6x - 6 inches\n   = 13x/2 - 6 inches\n7. To convert to feet, divide by 12 inches/foot:\n   (13x/2 - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 feet\n8. Simplify:\n   13x/24 - 12/24 = (13x - 12)/24 feet\nTherefore, the length of the fence in feet is (13x - 12)/24\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
