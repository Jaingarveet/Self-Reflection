        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let's represent the smallest of the 5 consecutive odd numbers as 2n+1. Then the other 4 numbers will be 2n+3, 2n+5, 2n+7, and 2n+9.\n2. The sum of these 5 numbers is:\n   (2n+1) + (2n+3) + (2n+5) + (2n+7) + (2n+9) \n   = 10n + 25\n3. The question states that this sum when divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let's call this perfect square m^2.\n   So, (10n + 25)/10 = m^2\n   Simplifying, n + 2.5 = m^2\n4. Since n is an integer (as the numbers are odd), and 2.5 is not an integer, m^2 cannot be an integer. But a perfect square is always an integer. \n   This means there are no such 5 consecutive odd numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n5. However, we are asked to choose one of the given options. So let's test each:\n   A: 47 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n   B: 91 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n   C: 41 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n   D: 67 is an odd number, but it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n   E: 44 is an even number, so it can't be part of the set of odd numbers.\n6. Among these, 44 is the only number that can't be part of the set of 5 consecutive odd numbers, regardless of whether they satisfy the sum condition or not.\nTherefore, the answer is E: 44.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
