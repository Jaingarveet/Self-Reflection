        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed. \n2. It takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point at this speed.\n3. We need to find the length of the shuttle. Let's call this length L.\nTo find the length, we can use the formula:\n* Speed = Distance / Time\n* Rearranging, Distance = Speed × Time\nWe know the time it takes the shuttle to pass a point is 5 seconds. \nTo get the speed, we can use the information about the 700m height:\n* Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s\nNow plugging into the distance formula:\n* Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s \n* Distance = 87.5 meters\nThe question asks for the length of the shuttle. This distance of 87.5m that we calculated represents the length of the shuttle.\nLooking at the answer choices, 87.5m is closest to 75m.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
