        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. We have a circle with points A, B, C, D in order around the circumference.\n2. Minor arc AC is 160°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means:\n   - Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°\n   - Minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°\n3. We are also told that minor arc BD is 150°. \n4. To find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to visualize the circle:\n   - Going clockwise from A to D, we have minor arc AB (80°) plus minor arc BD (150°).\n   - So minor arc AD = 80° + 150° = 230°\n5. However, 230° is more than half the circle. The question asks for the minor arc between A and D.\n   - In a circle, the sum of a minor arc and major arc between the same two points is always 360°.\n   - So the minor arc AD must be: 360° - 230° = 130°\n6. Looking at the answer choices, 130° corresponds to choice B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
