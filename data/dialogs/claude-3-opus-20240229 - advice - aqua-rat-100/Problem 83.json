The question specifies that we need to find the number of ways to rearrange the letters to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat. This means we are looking for permutations without repetition.\n3. In \"PROBLEC\", there are no repeated letters. All 7 letters are distinct.\n4. For permutations without repetition, where all elements are distinct, the formula is simply n!, where n is the number of distinct elements.\n5. Here, n = 7 since there are 7 distinct letters.\n6. Therefore, the number of ways to rearrange \"PROBLEC\" into 7 letter words with no repeating letters is 7!\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
