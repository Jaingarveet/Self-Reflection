        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Understand the relationships:\n   - 6 pita breads = 2 rolls (in terms of falafel amount)\n   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes\n   - We want to find how many pita breads equal 2 baguettes\n2. Express rolls in terms of pita breads:\n   - 6 pita breads = 2 rolls\n   - 1 roll = 6/2 = 3 pita breads\n3. Express baguettes in terms of rolls:\n   - 3 rolls = 5 baguettes \n   - 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls\n4. Express 2 baguettes in terms of rolls:\n   - 1 baguette = 3/5 rolls\n   - 2 baguettes = 2 * (3/5) = 6/5 rolls\n5. Express 2 baguettes in terms of pita breads:\n   - 1 roll = 3 pita breads\n   - 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * 3 = 18/5 = 3.6 pita breads\nTherefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3.6 pita breads.\nLooking at the answer choices, 3.6 pita breads is equivalent to 18/5 pita breads, which matches choice E: 25/3.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
