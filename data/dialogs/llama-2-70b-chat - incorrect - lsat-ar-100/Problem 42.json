If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Condition 2 is violated since two zoologists are selected, and condition 5 is violated since M is not selected.\n\nB: G, H, K, L, M\nThis selection includes one botanist (G), one chemist (K), and two zoologists (L, M).
