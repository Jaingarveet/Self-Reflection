At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, I can offer a solution based on the given information.\n\nLet's analyze the given conditions:\n\n1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n\nFrom condition 1, we can conclude that the bottom shelf has at least three books, and the top shelf has at most two books.\n\nFrom condition 2, I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can place I on the middle shelf.\n\nFrom condition 3, K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so we can place K on the top shelf and F on the middle shelf.\n\nFrom condition 4, O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so we can place O on the top shelf and L on the bottom shelf.\n\nFrom condition 5, F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we can place F and M on the middle shelf.\n\nNow, let's consider the given choices:\n\nA: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. This is true, as I and M are both on the middle shelf.\nB: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. This is false, as K is on the top shelf, and G is on the bottom shelf.\nC: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. This is false, as L is on the bottom shelf, and F is on the middle shelf.\nD: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. This is false, as M is on the middle shelf, and H is on the bottom shelf.\nE: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. This is false, as H is on the bottom shelf, and O is on the top shelf.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other."
