Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, I can offer some guidance on how to approach the problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a logical reasoning approach. We know that the shoe store is in space 4, and we have certain constraints that must be met. Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.\n2. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\n3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nNow, let's consider each choice:\n\nA: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\nThis choice is possible, but we don't have enough information to confirm that it must be true.\n\nB: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\nThis choice is false. We know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, but not both.\n\nC: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\nThis choice is possible, but we don't have enough information to confirm that it must be true.\n\nD: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\nThis choice is false. We know that the shoe store is in space 4, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be in one of the spaces between the shoe store and the veterinarian.\n\nE: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nThis choice is false. We know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and the shoe store is in space 4. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in one of the spaces between the shoe store and the toy store.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
