Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Therefore, I'll work through the problem from scratch.\n\nLet's break down the given information into smaller parts:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nNow, let's create a list of possible assignments for each employee:\n\n1. Young: #5, #6\n2. Togowa: #4, #6\n3. Xu: #3, #5\n4. Souza: #2, #4\n5. Robertson: #1, #2, #3, #4\n6. Vaughn: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6\n\nNow, let's consider the given choices:\n\nA: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nThis violates rule 1, as Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nB: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nThis satisfies rule 1, as Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. However, it violates rule 3, as Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nC: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nThis satisfies rules 1 and 3, as Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and Togowa. However, it violates rule 4, as Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nD: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nThis violates rule 2, as Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nE: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nThis satisfies all the rules, as Vaughn is assigned a parking space that is not in conflict with any of the other employees' assignments. Therefore, this choice is correct.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
