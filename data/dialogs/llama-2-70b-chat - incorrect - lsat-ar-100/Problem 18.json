Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nB: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\nThis schedule does not fulfill the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nC: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\nThis schedule fulfills all the given conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert gives an afternoon report. Also, Nina does not give a report on Wednesday, so the condition that Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day is not violated. Therefore, this choice is correct.\n\nD: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\nThis schedule does not fulfill the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. In this schedule, Nina gives a report on Monday, but Helen and Irving do not give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nE: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\nThis schedule does not fulfill the condition that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous answer, I made a mistake by not carefully analyzing the given choices and their feasibility according to the conditions stated in the question. I eliminated choice C, which turned out to be the correct answer. I learned that it is essential to thoroughly evaluate each option and ensure that it meets all the conditions stated in the problem. I also learned that I should not rely on my first instincts and should always double-check my answer before submitting it."
