However, I can offer a solution to this problem.\n\nLet's break down the conditions given in the question:\n\n1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that either Jackson or another witness must testify on Monday. Let's assume that the other witness who testifies on Monday is X.\n\nNow, we have two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Franco testifies on Wednesday.\nIn this scenario, we can schedule the witnesses as follows:\n\nMonday: Jackson, X\nTuesday: Garcia, Hong\nWednesday: Iturbe, Franco\n\nThis schedule satisfies all the conditions given in the question.\n\nScenario 2: Franco does not testify on Wednesday.\nIn this scenario, we can schedule the witnesses as follows:\n\nMonday: Jackson, X\nTuesday: Garcia, Hong\nWednesday: Iturbe, Hong\n\nThis schedule also satisfies all the conditions given in the question.\n\nTherefore, we have two possible schedules that satisfy all the conditions:\n\nSchedule 1:\nMonday: Jackson, X\nTuesday: Garcia, Hong\nWednesday: Iturbe, Franco\n\nSchedule 2:\nMonday: Jackson, X\nTuesday: Garcia, Hong\nWednesday: Iturbe, Hong\n\nSince we are asked which one of the following must be true of the schedule, we can eliminate answer choices A, C, D, and E, as none of them are necessarily true for both schedules.\n\nThe correct answer is B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
