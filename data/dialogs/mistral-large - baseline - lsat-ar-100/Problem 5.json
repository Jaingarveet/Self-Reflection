Therefore, F and M must be on either the top or bottom shelf.\nSince K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on either the top or middle shelf.\nSince O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on either the top or middle shelf.\nSince F is placed on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the middle shelf with I. Therefore, F and M must be on either the top or bottom shelf.\nSince the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, and F and M are already on the bottom shelf, there is only room for one more book on the bottom shelf.
