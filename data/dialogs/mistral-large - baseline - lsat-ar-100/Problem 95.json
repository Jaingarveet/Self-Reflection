Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists could accurately identify the cargo held in each of the loading dock's first three bays, listed in order from bay 1 to bay 3?\nChoices:\n  A: fuel, machinery, textiles\n  B: grain, machinery, fuel\n  C: machinery, livestock, fuel\n  D: machinery, textiles, fuel\n  E: machinery, textiles, produce\n"

Therefore, textiles cannot be in bay 3, and grain cannot be in bay 1 or 2.\nWe also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so fuel cannot be in bay 3.\nFinally, we know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be in bay 1.\nBased on this information, we can eliminate choices A, B, and D, since they all have textiles in bay 3. We can also eliminate choice C, since it has livestock in bay 2, which contradicts the information that livestock has a higher number than textiles.\nTherefore, the only remaining choice is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
