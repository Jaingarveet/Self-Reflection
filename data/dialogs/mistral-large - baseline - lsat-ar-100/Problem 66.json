Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fourth.\n  B: H is sixth.\n  C: R is fourth.\n  D: R is seventh.\n  E: Y is fifth.\n"

S must be earlier than Y.\n4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\n\nNow let's consider the answer choices:\n\nA: H is fourth.\nIf H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S (in any order), since S can't be earlier than Q unless Q is third, and S must be earlier than Y. But this would mean that two consecutive articles cover the same topic (nutrition), which violates condition 1. So, A is not correct.\n\nB: H is sixth.\nIf H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, G, and J (in any order). But this would mean that two consecutive articles cover the same topic (finance), which violates condition 1. So, B is not correct.\n\nC: R is fourth.\nIf R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and J (in any order). This satisfies all the conditions so far. The remaining articles can be arranged as H, G, and Y, which also satisfies all the conditions. So, C is a possible answer.\n\nD: R is seventh.\nIf R is seventh, then the first six articles must be Q, S, J, H, G, and Y (in any order). But this would mean that two consecutive articles cover the same topic (finance), which violates condition 1. So, D is not correct.\n\nE: Y is fifth.\nIf Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, J, and H (in any order). But this would mean that two consecutive articles cover the same topic (finance), which violates condition 1. So, E is not correct.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
