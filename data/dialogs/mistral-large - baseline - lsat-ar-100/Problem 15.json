Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\n"

Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian in one of the spaces adjacent to it (space 1 or 7).\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
