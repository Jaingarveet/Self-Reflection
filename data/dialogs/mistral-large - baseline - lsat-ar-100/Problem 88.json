At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n"

Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we can assume that there are at least two books on the middle shelf.\n\nIf K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then K and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the top shelf.\n\nSince F is placed on the same shelf as M, and I is already on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nNow we have:\nTop shelf: K, O\nMiddle shelf: I\nBottom shelf: F, M\n\nWe still need to place G and H, and we know that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
