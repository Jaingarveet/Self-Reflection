Therefore, L must be on the top shelf.\nSince O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf as well.\nSince F is placed on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the top shelf because it already has two books (L and O). Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I.\nSince K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf.\nTherefore, the top shelf has L, O, and K; the middle shelf has I, F, and M; and the bottom shelf has G and H.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
