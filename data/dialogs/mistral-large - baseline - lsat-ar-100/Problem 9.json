        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n"

        "content": "Thought:\nThe question states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Additionally, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and can only be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.\n\nSince Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nIf Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. Since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 or #2. Since Togowa can be assigned parking space #1, answer choice \"A\" could be true."
