Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The glasses are stirred with a stirring rod. the glasses\nChoices:\n  A: are seen set on the table and are slowly panned over from right to left.\n  B: are filled with ice and poured afterwards.\n  C: are filled with lemonade, vegetables and honey mustard.\n  D: are taken off the counter and poured into wooden bowls using a sharp knife.\n\nThought process:\n1. Steaming hot water is poured over lemons in glasses. This is a common first step in making lemonade.\n2. The glasses are stirred, likely to help dissolve the sugar and mix the lemon juice with the water.\n3. After stirring, the next logical step would be to add ice to cool the lemonade before serving.\n4. The other options don't make sense in the context of making lemonade.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

While the first two sentences could be part of making lemonade, I jumped to conclusions without considering the full context provided in the answer choices. I failed to recognize that this was likely describing a video or film scene rather than a real-life process.\nError Keywords:\n - Assumption error\n - Lack of context consideration\n - Premature conclusion\n - Misinterpretation of question\nSolution:\nThe text describes:\n1. Steaming hot water being poured over lemons in glasses\n2. The glasses being stirred with a stirring rod\n3. The glasses...\nLooking at the answer choices, only A makes sense to complete the third sentence in the context of a video or film scene:\n\"are seen set on the table and are slowly panned over from right to left.\"\nThe other choices do not logically complete the sentence or fit the context.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the entire question carefully, including all answer choices.\n2. Identify keywords and context clues in the question text.\n3. Consider each answer choice in the context of the question.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that do not logically complete the given text.\n5. Select the answer choice that provides the most likely and coherent completion.\n6. Re-read the completed text with your selected answer to ensure it makes sense.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the full question and all answer choices before making a decision.\n - Pay attention to context clues and consider the broader scenario, not just the immediate text.\n - Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions without considering all the information provided.\n - Eliminate answer choices that don't fit logically or grammatically with the given text.\n - If the question seems to be describing a scene or process, visualize it in your mind to better understand the context."
