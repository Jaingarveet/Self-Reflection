Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI focused too narrowly on finding a direct continuation of the cooking action described in the introduction. While D seemed to continue the cooking theme, it introduced new elements (pasta, eggs) that didn't logically follow from seasoning a pan. I didn't properly consider B, which zooms out to frame the introduction as part of a cooking video series, the most logical completion in retrospect.\nError Keywords:\n - Narrow focus \n - Overlooking context\n - Overemphasizing direct continuation\n - Ignoring framing/perspective shift\nSolution:\nThe given text describes a scene of a man seasoning a pan in the kitchen. \nB suggests this is an introduction to one of 6 cooking videos in a series called \"steve's cooking\".\nThis provides context that the seasoning scene is part of a larger cooking video.\nThe other options either fail to logically continue the scene (A, C) or introduce elements inconsistent with the setup (D).\nConsidering the framing of the scene as an intro to a cooking video, B is the most likely completion.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the given text carefully and understand the scene it's describing.\n2. Consider each answer choice and how it relates to or continues the given text.\n3. Don't just look for a direct continuation of the described action - consider changes in framing or perspective.\n4. Eliminate choices that are irrelevant or inconsistent with the setup.\n5. Select the choice that provides the most logical and likely completion or continuation, which may reframe or provide context for the initial text.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the larger context and framing, not just the immediate action.\n - Be open to perspective shifts or zooming out, not just linear continuations.\n - Eliminate choices that introduce inconsistent or irrelevant elements.\n - The most likely completion should make logical sense, but may provide new context to the original text.\n - If an answer choice recontextualizes the scene in a reasonable way, it may be the most likely completion even if it doesn't directly continue the action."
