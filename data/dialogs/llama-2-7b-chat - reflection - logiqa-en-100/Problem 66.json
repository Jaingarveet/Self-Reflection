Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\n\n  Great, let's tackle this question!\n\nFrom the given information, we can form the following diagram:\n\nE | F | G | H | I\n\nFrom (1), we know that F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H. Therefore, the position of F can be represented as:\n\nF | H\n\nFrom (2), we know that I and E are adjacent. Therefore, the position of I can be represented as:\n\nI | E\n\nFrom (3), we know that G is somewhere in the north of F. Therefore, the position of G can be represented as:\n\nG | F\n\nNow, we have the positions of all the islands in the diagram:\n\nE | F | G | H | I\n\nThere are 5 possible arrangements for this group of islands:\n\n1. E | F | G | H | I\n2. E | F | I | G | H\n3. E | G | F | H | I\n4. E | G | I | F | H\n5. E | H | G | F | I\n\nSo, the answer is (C) 4 possible arrangements.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
