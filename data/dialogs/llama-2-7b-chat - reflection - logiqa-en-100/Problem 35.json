Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.\nQuestion: Which of the following may be correct?\nChoices:\n  A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.\n  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.\n  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.\n  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\n\n  Great! Let's apply our logical thinking skills to solve this problem.\n\nFrom the given information, we can conclude that:\n\n1. Li was hired by Tianshu.\n2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit.\n3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit.\n4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given choices:\n\nA: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.\nThis choice is incorrect because Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, not Li and Liu.\n\nB: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.\nThis choice is also incorrect because Zhang was not hired by Tianxuan, so Wang was not hired by Tianxuan.\n\nC: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.\nThis choice is correct! Since Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit, and Zhao was hired by Tianxuan, we can conclude that only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.\n\nD: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\nThis choice is also incorrect because Wang was not hired by Tianxuan, as we established earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
