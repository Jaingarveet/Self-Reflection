Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) Each group has at least 3 employees .(2) F and K cannot be in the same group.(3) If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.(4) M is at least one of the members of these two groups.(5) At least one of the same employees in both groups.\nQuestion: If the printing group has only three members, G, H, and L, and under sufficient conditions, the two groups have as many common members as possible, then which of the following statements must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.\n  B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.\n  C: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same.\n  D: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.\n\n  Thought: To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine which statement is true based on the information provided.\n\nFrom condition (1), we know that each group has at least 3 employees.\nFrom condition (2), we know that F and K cannot be in the same group, so K cannot be in the printing group.\nFrom condition (3), we know that if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Since K is not in the printing group, J cannot be in the printing group either.\nFrom condition (4), we know that M is at least one of the members of the two groups.\nFrom condition (5), we know that at least one of the same employees is in both groups.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given options:\n\nA: The binding group and the printing group happen to have a common member.\nThis is not true because, according to condition (3), J cannot be in the printing group if K is in the group. Therefore, there cannot be a common member between the two groups.\n\nB: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.\nThis is true because, according to condition (5), at least one of the same employees is in both groups. Since there are only three members in the printing group, the only common member between the two groups is G, H, and L.\n\nC: The number of members in the binding and printing groups is the same.\nThis is false because the printing group has only three members, while the binding group has at least four members (according to condition (1)).\n\nD: The number of members of the bookbinding group is at least one more than that of the printing group.\nThis is false because the printing group has three members, and the binding group has at least four members (according to condition (1)).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The binding group and the printing group have exactly two members in common.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
