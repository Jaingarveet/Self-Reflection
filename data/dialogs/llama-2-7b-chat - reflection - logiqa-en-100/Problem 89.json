Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: There are 7 heart disease patients E, F, G, H, I, J, K to be assigned to 4 doctors for treatment, they are Dr.Zhang, Dr.Li, Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu.Only one doctor is responsible for each patient, and each doctor is responsible for the treatment of up to two patients.Among the patients, J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults; E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females.The following conditions must be met? (1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\n\n  Thought: Based on the conditions provided, we need to assign the patients to the doctors in a way that meets all the requirements.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the conditions:\n\n1. Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.\n2. Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.\n3. If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\n\nFrom the patient list, we can see that:\n\n* J and K are children (male and female, respectively).\n* E, F, and H are adults (male and female, respectively).\n\nSo, we need to assign J and K to doctors who are responsible for treating male patients, and E, F, and H to doctors who are responsible for treating adult patients.\n\nNow, let's consider the doctors:\n\n* Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients, so he cannot treat J or K.\n* Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, so she cannot treat more than 1 patient.\n* Dr.Wang is responsible for treating adult patients, so he cannot treat J or K.\n\nSo, the only possible assignment of patients to doctors is:\n\n* J is treated by Dr.Li (as she is the only doctor who can treat a child patient and has no other patients to treat).\n* K is treated by Dr.Wang (as he is the only doctor who can treat a child patient and has no other patients to treat).\n* E is treated by Dr.Zhang (as he is the only doctor who can treat a male adult patient).\n* F is treated by Dr.Liu (as she is the only doctor who can treat a female adult patient).\n* H is treated by Dr.Li (as she is the only doctor who can treat a male adult patient).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
