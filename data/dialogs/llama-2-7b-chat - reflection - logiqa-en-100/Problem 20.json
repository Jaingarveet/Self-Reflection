        "content": " Explanation:\nThe argument relies on the assumption that China has lost its cultural classics and traditions. This assumption is stated in the passage as \"China has become a country that has almost lost its cultural classics and traditions.\" Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Primary school reading is a symbol of a country and nation maintaining cultural classics and traditions.\n\nExplanation of the answer:\nThe argument states that in the United States, the President takes the oath of office under the Bible, and elementary school students recite the oath of \"a country under the protection of God\" by pressing the chest every week. This suggests that in the United States, primary school reading is seen as a way to maintain cultural classics and traditions. In contrast, the passage states that in China, elementary school students have long ceased reading the Bible, and no one has sworn in according to the Analects. This implies that China has lost its cultural classics and traditions. Therefore, the assumption upon which the argument relies is that China has lost its cultural classics and traditions, which is option (C) Primary school reading is a symbol of a country and nation maintaining cultural classics and traditions."
