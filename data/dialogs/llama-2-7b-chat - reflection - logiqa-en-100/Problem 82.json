Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, the correct answer is D: Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses.\n\nThe argument assumes that all newly built houses in Hexi Village are small property houses, but this is not true. The argument does not take into account the possibility that some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village may not be small property houses. Therefore, the argument is weakened by the presence of non-small property houses in Hexi Village.\n\nOption A, \"This newly built house in Hexi Village has been tacitly approved by relevant departments,\" does not weaken the argument as it does not affect the fact that small-property houses are not protected by law.\n\nOption B, \"This newly built house in Hexi Village is a small property house,\" is incorrect because the argument states that small-property houses are not protected by law, and therefore, the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law regardless of whether it is a small property house or not.\n\nOption C, \"This newly built house in Hexi Village is built on rural collective land,\" is incorrect because the argument does not rely on the location of the house but rather the legal status of small-property houses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses."
