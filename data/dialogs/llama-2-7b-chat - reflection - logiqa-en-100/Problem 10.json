Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: In a study, 51 middle school student volunteers were divided into a test group and a control group to receive the same mathematics training.During the five-day training, the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members that were considered to be related to computing power.The subsequent test results showed that the mathematics ability of the test group members was significantly higher than that of the control group members.To their surprise, the effect of this ability improvement can last at least half a year.The researchers therefore believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, best supports the above researchers â€™views?\nChoices:\n  A: This non-invasive stimulus is inexpensive and will not cause any pain to the human body\n  B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations\n  C: Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same\n  D: Subjects with microshocks in the brain are more concerned about their behavior, and their concentration is more focused during the test\n\n  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe best supporting evidence for the researchers' views is that after a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations. This suggests that the micro-shocks in the brain have a temporary, reversible effect on the brain's computing power, which aligns with the researchers' conclusion that micro-shocks can improve the brain's computing power.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nThe correct answer is (C) Before the experiment, the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same.\n\nThe passage states that the researchers divided the 51 middle school student volunteers into a test group and a control group, and that the test group received the same mathematics training. However, the passage does not provide any information about the initial mathematics scores of the two groups. Therefore, option (C) is the best supporting evidence for the researchers' views, as it suggests that the test group and control group had similar initial mathematics scores, which makes the improvement in the test group's mathematics ability more significant and meaningful.\n\nThe other options do not provide sufficient support for the researchers' views:\n\nOption (A) is irrelevant, as the passage does not mention anything about the cost or pain associated with the stimulus.\n\nOption (B) is incorrect, as the passage states that the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced after a slight electric shock, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations. This suggests that the effect of the micro-shocks on the brain's computing power is temporary and reversible, which contradicts the researchers' conclusion.\n\nOption (D) is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about the subjects' behavior or concentration during the test."
