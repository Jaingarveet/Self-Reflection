Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\nQuestion: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?\nChoices:\n  A: Tang Xiaohua\n  B: Peng Youwen\n  C: Qiu Zhijie\n  D: Song Wenkai\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the requirements given in the question:\n\n(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, so we can assume that they are selected in different rounds.\n\n(2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time, so we can assume that they are selected in different rounds.\n\n(3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, so we can assume that they are selected in different rounds.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of selections:\n\n1. Guo Yanran and He Zhilian are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively.\n2. Tang Xiaohua is selected in round 3.\n3. Peng Youwen and Qiu Zhijie are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively.\n4. Song Wenkai is selected in round 3.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA) Tang Xiaohua: Since Guo Yanran and He Zhilian are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected in round 1. Therefore, option A is not possible.\n\nB) Peng Youwen: Since Peng Youwen and Qiu Zhijie are selected in round 1 and 2, respectively, Peng Youwen cannot be selected in round 3. Therefore, option B is not possible.\n\nC) Qiu Zhijie: Since Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, Qiu Zhijie cannot be selected in round 3. Therefore, option C is not possible.\n\nD) Song Wenkai: Since Song Wenkai is selected in round 3, option D is possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D: Song Wenkai.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
