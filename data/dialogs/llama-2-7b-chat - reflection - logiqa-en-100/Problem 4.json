Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) Each speaker speaks only once, and only once at the same time By.(2) Three speakers speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.(3) G must speak before lunch.(4) Only one speaker is between M and N.(5) F speaks in the first or third place.\nQuestion: If J is the fourth speaker, who must be the third speaker?\nChoices:\n  A: F or M\n  C: L or N\n  B: G or L\n  D: M or N\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the given information to determine who the third speaker is if J is the fourth speaker.\n\n1. Each speaker speaks only once, and only once at the same time.\n2. Three speakers speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.\n3. G must speak before lunch.\n4. Only one speaker is between M and N.\n5. F speaks in the first or third place.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n* The first speaker is either F or M.\n* The second speaker is either G or L.\n* The third speaker is either J or N.\n* The fourth speaker is J.\n\nNow, let's use the information provided in the question:\n\n* J is the fourth speaker.\n\nSo, the third speaker must be either N or M.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

J is the fourth speaker, so the third speaker must be either N or M.\n2. Since G must speak before lunch, the second speaker is either G or L.\n3. Since F speaks in the first or third place, the first speaker is either F or M.\n4. Since only one speaker is between M and N, the second speaker cannot be M.\n\nTherefore, the third speaker is N.\n\nWell done!"
