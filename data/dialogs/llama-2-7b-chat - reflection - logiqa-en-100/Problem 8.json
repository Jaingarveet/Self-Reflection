Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

You have correctly identified the correct answer, which is (D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe information provided in the question stem only tells us that Xiao Qiang's study time is longer than Xiao Gang's, and Xiao Qiang has more books than Xiao Gang. It does not provide any information about the quality of Xiao Qiang's knowledge, Xiao Gang's intelligence, or the effectiveness of their treatment of life. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the relative intelligence or knowledge of Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang based on the information provided.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects. Good job!"
