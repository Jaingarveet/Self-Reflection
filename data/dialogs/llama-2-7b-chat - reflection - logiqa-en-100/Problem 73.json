Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: If G is in team 1, which pair of magicians can be in team 1?\nChoices:\n  A: K and L\n  B: K and P\n  C: L and N\n  D: L and Q\n\n  Great! Let's apply the conditions to determine which pair of magicians can be in team 1 if G is in team 1:\n\n1. If G is in team 1, then K must be in the middle. (Condition 1)\n2. If K is in the middle, then L must be in team 1. (Condition 6)\n3. If L is in team 1, then neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. (Condition 5)\n\nNow, let's eliminate the impossible pairs:\n\nB: K and P - K is already in the middle, so P cannot be in the same team as K.\nC: L and N - L is already in team 1, so N cannot be in the same team as L.\n\nSo, the only possible pair is:\n\nA: K and L - K is in the middle, and L is in team 1.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
