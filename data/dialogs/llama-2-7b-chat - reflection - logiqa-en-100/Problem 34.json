Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

It simply states that you should not do something undesirable to others.\n\nOption (A) is a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that only those who want to do something can do it to others. However, this is not the correct interpretation of the sentence.\n\nOption (C) is also not a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that one should not treat others unless they want to. The sentence does not suggest that treating others is conditional on their willingness.\n\nOption (D) is also not a logical inference from the sentence, as it implies that whatever is applied to people should be what they want. The sentence does not suggest that the desires of others should be the basis for what is applied to them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) If you want, then give it to others."
