Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe passage states that Xiao Wang used the method of \"pointing out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves\" to refute Xiao Chen's views. Xiao Wang argued that people don't normally observe comets far away from the sun, yet Xiao Chen claimed that the 1996D3 comet flicker light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation. This contradiction in arguments suggests that Xiao Chen's views are incorrect.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "  Great, you have correctly answered the question!\n\nThe correct answer is (B) pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion. Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by pointing out the contradiction in his arguments. Xiao Chen claimed that the 1996D3 comet flicker light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation, but people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun. This contradiction in arguments suggests that Xiao Chen's views are incorrect.\n\nWell done! Here are some additional questions to help you reinforce your understanding of the topic:\n\n1. What is the main point of contention between Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang?\n2. How did Xiao Wang refute Xiao Chen's views?\n3. What does the passage suggest about the reliability of Xiao Chen's argument?\n\nI hope you find these questions helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further clarification on any of the concepts."
