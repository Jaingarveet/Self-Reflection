Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Based on the following questions? Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, they can weaken the above argument, except\nChoices:\n  A: The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.\n  B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.\n  C: The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods.\n  D: The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe argument being made is that advertisers have ethical responsibilities beyond just economic benefits, and the example of the family magazine \"Bay\" being renamed \"Inferno\" and publishing violent and pornographic content shows that some advertisers take this into account.\n\nOption A weakens this argument by suggesting that the violent and pornographic content published in \"Purgatory\" magazine is more moderate than in similar magazines, which undermines the idea that advertisers are concerned about ethical responsibilities.\n\nOption B is irrelevant to the argument and does not provide any information that would weaken it.\n\nOption C is also irrelevant and does not provide any information that would weaken the argument.\n\nOption D is the best answer, as it provides a specific piece of information that weakens the argument. If the advertising cost of the magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change, it could suggest that the name change was not as effective as the argument suggests, and that the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts may have had other reasons beyond ethical considerations.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "  Great job! You have identified the correct answer, which is option B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.\n\nHere's why this option weakens the argument:\n\nThe argument suggests that advertisers have ethical responsibilities beyond just economic benefits. However, if violent and pornographic content sells well but has low credibility, it suggests that advertisers may be more interested in short-term financial gains than in ethical considerations. This undermines the idea that advertisers take their ethical responsibilities seriously.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, is irrelevant to the argument, as it does not provide any information that would weaken it. Option C is also irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about the advertising cost of the magazine. Option D provides specific information that weakens the argument, as a higher advertising cost after the name change could suggest that the name change was not as effective as the argument suggests.\n\nWell done!"
