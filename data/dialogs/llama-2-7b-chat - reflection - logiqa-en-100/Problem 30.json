Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "  Explanation:\n\nThe given statement describes the conditions for selecting five candidates from a group of six people. The conditions are:\n\n1. At least one person of Bingding is selected: Since Bingding is one of the candidates, this condition is satisfied.\n2. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected: Since E is not selected, this condition is not satisfied.\n3. A maximum of 2 people are selected: Since three people (A, B, and C) are selected, this condition is not satisfied.\n\nNow, based on these conditions, we need to determine who is not in the fourth position.\n\nOption A states that the person in the fourth position is A. However, since A is selected, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B states that the person in the fourth position is B. However, since B is not selected, this option is also incorrect.\n\nOption C states that the person in the fourth position is C. However, since three people (A, B, and C) are selected, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D states that the person in the fourth position is Ding. Since Ding is not a candidate, this option is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the person who is not in the fourth position is Ding.\n\nAdvice:\n\n1. Read the conditions carefully: Make sure you understand the conditions given in the problem and apply them correctly.\n2. Use logical reasoning: Use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer based on the given conditions.\n3. Check your work: Double-check your answer by applying the conditions to the selected candidates.\n4. Pay attention to the given information: Make sure you pay attention to the information given in the problem, including the names of the candidates and the conditions for selection."
