Let's evaluate each answer choice based on the given conditions:\n\nA: A 1-day website target - This target can be set for all three clients, as none of the clients can have a website target longer than their voicemail target. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.\n\nB: A 2-day voicemail target - This target can be set for Image and Solide, as their voicemail targets are shorter than their website targets. However, it cannot be set for Truvest, as its website target is shorter than its voicemail target. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.\n\nC: A 2-day website target - This target can be set for Solide, as its website target is shorter than Truvest's website target. However, it cannot be set for Image, as its voicemail target is shorter than its website target. Therefore, this option is not the correct answer.\n\nD: A 3-day voicemail target - This target can be set for Truvest, as its voicemail target is longer than its website target. However, it cannot be set for Image or Solide, as their voicemail targets are shorter than their website targets.
