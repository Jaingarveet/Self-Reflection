Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports.\n2. Exactly two reports will be given each day.\n3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so George will give a morning report on Tuesday.\n4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.\n5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n6. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we need to find the morning reports for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n7. Olivia can give a morning report on Monday, and Robert can give a morning report on Wednesday.\n8. George can give a morning report on Tuesday.\n9. Helen can give a morning report on Wednesday.\n10. Irving can give a morning report on Monday.\n"

I mistakenly thought that Nina could give a report on any day, which led me to eliminate choice C.\n\nUpon reflection, I realized that Nina can only give a report on Wednesday, which means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Therefore, the correct answer is choice C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia.\n\nI have learned to carefully read and understand the conditions of the problem and to think critically about the possibilities before eliminating any choices."
