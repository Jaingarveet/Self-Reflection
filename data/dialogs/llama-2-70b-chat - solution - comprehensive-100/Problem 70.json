From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by $20 \\%$ and the population of City $\\mathrm{Y}$ decreased by $10 \\%$. If the population of City $\\mathrm{X}$ was 120,000 in 2010, what was the population of City Y in 2010 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 60,000\n  B: 90,000\n  C: 160,000\n  D: 240,000\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's call the population of City X \"X\" and the population of City Y \"Y\".\nWe know that X = Y + 20,000 (since the population of City X increased by 20%)\nWe also know that X + Y = 120,000 (since the populations are equal)\nX = Y + 20,000 ... (1)\nX + Y = 120,000 ... (2)\nSubtracting (1) from (2), we get:\nY = 100,000\n\nNow we can find the population of City Y in 2010:\nY = 100,000 - 10% of 100,000\nY = 100,000 - 10,000\nY = [REDACTED]\n"
