What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. The space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.\n2. It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its horizontal speed is 700/5 = 140 m/s.\n3. The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.\n4. The length of the space shuttle (L) can be found using the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds in this case).\n5. Substituting the values, we get L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 9[REDACTED].\n\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 9[REDACTED], which corresponds to choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
