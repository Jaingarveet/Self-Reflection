Safety goggles are essential for eye protection during any experiment, especially those involving heat. [REDACTED] stopwatch is not necessary as the boiling point is a fixed temperature, and timing is not a factor. \n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the tools required to determine the boiling point of a liquid. \n2. Recognize that safety goggles are essential for any experiment. \n3. Understand that a heat source and a thermometer are necessary to observe temperature changes. \n4. Realize that a stopwatch is not needed as the boiling point is a fixed temperature. \n\nAdvice:\n - Always consider safety first when designing experiments. \n - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the experimental procedure and requirements. \n - Avoid making assumptions about the necessity of safety equipment. \n - Remember that a stopwatch is used for timing, which is not required to determine a fixed temperature like the boiling point.\n"
