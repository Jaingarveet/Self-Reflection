Migration, hibernation, and nest building are driven primarily by instinct. While [REDACTED] can have an instinctual basis, they are often learned and refined through experience, especially in more complex species. Hunting is the only option that is not always instinctual, so it is the correct answer.\n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the concept of animal instinct: innate behaviors present from birth.\n2. Evaluate each option:\n   - Migrating: often driven by instinctual responses to environmental cues.\n   - Hibernating: an instinctual response to survive harsh conditions.\n   - Hunting skills: can be instinctual but also learned and refined through experience.\n   - Building nests: an instinctual behavior for many species.\n3. Identify the option that involves learned behaviors and is not solely instinctual.\n4. Hunting skills can be learned, so it is not solely an example of instinct.\n\nAdvice:\n- Avoid overgeneralizing and making assumptions.\n- Consider nuances and exceptions to general rules.\n- Evaluate each option critically and independently.\n- Understand the concept of instinct as innate and present from birth.\n- Recognize that some behaviors can have both instinctual and learned components.\n"
