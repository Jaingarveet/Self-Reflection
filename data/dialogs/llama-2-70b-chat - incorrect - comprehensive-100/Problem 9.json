However, I can provide a solution to the problem.\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n* The length of the road from Town F to Town G on the map is 20 inches.\n* 1/4 inch on the map represents an actual distance of 10 miles.\n\nNow, let's create a proportion to solve for the actual distance:\n\nMap distance : Actual distance\n20 inches : x miles\n\nWe know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 10 miles, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n1/4 inch = 10 miles\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n20 inches = 10 miles x (1/4 inch)\n20 inches = 10 miles x 0.25\n20 inches = 2.5 miles\n\nTherefore, the actual distance from Town F to Town G along this road is 2.5 miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
