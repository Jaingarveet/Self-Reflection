However, I can offer a solution to this problem.\n\nLet's analyze the given choices:\n\nA: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.\nSince type C robots can neither recognize colors nor shapes, it's not possible that both robots 1 and 2 are type C, as one picked up a red square (which implies it can recognize colors) and the other picked up a blue ball (which implies it can recognize shapes). Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nB: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.\nThis choice is possible, as we know that one of the robots picked up a red square, which means it's not type C. Therefore, this choice remains.\n\nC: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.\nThis choice is also possible, as we know that one robot picked up a red square, which means it's not type B, and the other robot picked up a blue ball, which means it's not type A. Therefore, this choice remains.\n\nD: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.\nThis choice is already covered in choice C, as we know that one robot is not type B and the other is not type A. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type."
