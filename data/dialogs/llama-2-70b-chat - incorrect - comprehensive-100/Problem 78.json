However, I can give you the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe breakdown of food substances by digestive juices indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion. This choice accurately describes a physical change because it involves the conversion of large, complex food molecules into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the body for energy, growth, and repair.\n\nIn contrast, choice A describes a chemical change (the addition of acids to create a ball of food), while choice B describes a biochemical change (the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides). Choice D describes a mechanical change (the squeezing of food through the intestines), which is not related to the process of digestion. Therefore, the correct answer is C."
