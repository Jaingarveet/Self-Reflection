However, I can solve the system of equations and provide the solution.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n\n3x + 4y = -23\n2y - x = -19\n\nWe can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we get:\n\nx = -4y - 23/3\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n2y - (-4y - 23/3) = -19\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n2y - 4y - 23/3 = -19\n-2y - 23/3 = -19\n-2y = -22\ny = 11\n\nNow, substitute y = 11 into one of the original equations to solve for x:\n\n3x + 4(11) = -23\n3x + 44 = -23\n3x = -67\nx = -22\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system is (x, y) = (-22, 11).\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
