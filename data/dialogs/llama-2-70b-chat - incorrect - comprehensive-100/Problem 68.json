Since the slope of the line is zero, the equation of the line is $y = b$.\n\nSubstituting the point $(2, k)$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$k = 2b$\n\nSubstituting the point $(k, 32)$ into the equation, we get:\n\n$32 = kb$\n\nDividing both sides by $k$, we get:\n\n$32/k = b$\n\nSince $b$ is a constant, it cannot be equal to $32/k$ for all values of $k$. Therefore, the value of $k$ that satisfies both equations is $k = 4$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
