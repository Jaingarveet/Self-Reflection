Here's my answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nThought:\nThe argument states that Carl is an incompetent detective because he has only solved 1 out of 25 cases assigned to him in the last 3 years, which is a smaller percentage than any other detective on the police force. However, choice D reveals that Carl's track record in his previous position as a detective in another city was also poor, with a solve rate of 1 out of 30. This suggests that Carl's lack of success is not just a result of the cases he has been assigned, but rather a pattern of incompetence that has followed him throughout his career. Therefore, choice D most seriously weakens the argument above."
