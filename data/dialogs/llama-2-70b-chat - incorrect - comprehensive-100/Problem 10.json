However, I can give you a step-by-step guide on how to solve this problem:\n\nLet's say each nephew receives x rupees.\nSince there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.\n\nEach daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.\nSince there are 4 daughters, the total amount they receive is 4x rupees.\n\nEach son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.\nSince there are 5 sons, the total amount they receive is 5x rupees.\n\nWe know that the total amount of money available is Rs 8600, so the total amount received by all daughters, sons, and nephews should equal Rs 8600.\n\nNow, we can set up the following equation:\n4x + 5x + 2x = 8600\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n11x = 8600\n\nDividing both sides by 11:\nx = 780\n\nSo, each daughter receives 4x = 4(780) = 3120 rupees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
