However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nThe length of the fence can be calculated by finding the total width of all the pickets and the space between them.\n\nLet's first find the total width of all the pickets:\nTotal width of pickets = Number of pickets x Width of each picket\n= x x 1/2\n= x/2\n\nNow, let's find the total width of the space between the pickets:\nTotal width of space = Number of pickets x Space between each pair of pickets\n= x x 6\n= 6x\n\nNow, we add the total width of the pickets and the space between them to get the total length of the fence:\nTotal length of fence = Total width of pickets + Total width of space\n= x/2 + 6x\n= 7x/2\n\nSo, the length of the fence in feet is 7x/2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
