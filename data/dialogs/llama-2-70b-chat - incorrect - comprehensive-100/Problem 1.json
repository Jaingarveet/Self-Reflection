        "content": "  The monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We can represent this mathematically as:\n\nS = 500 + (0.05) \\* x\n\nwhere x is the monthly sales.\n\nWe want the monthly salary to reach $1500, so we set up the equation:\n\n500 + (0.05) \\* x = 1500\n\nTo solve for x, we can first subtract 500 from both sides:\n\n(0.05) \\* x = 1000\n\nNext, we can divide both sides by 0.05:\n\nx = 1000 / 0.05\n\nx = 20,000\n\nTherefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 so that the shop assistant's monthly salary reaches $1500.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
