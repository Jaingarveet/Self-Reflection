        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. The formula is density = mass / volume.\n2. To find mass, we can rearrange the formula to: mass = density * volume\n3. For the bricks:\n   - 2 m^3 of bricks: mass = 2000 kg/m^3 * 2 m^3 = 4000 kg\n   - 4 m^3 of bricks: mass = 2000 kg/m^3 * 4 m^3 = 8000 kg\n4. For the air: \n   - 6000 m^3 of air: mass = 1 kg/m^3 * 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg  \n   - 10,000 m^3 of air: mass = 1 kg/m^3 * 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg\n5. Comparing the masses:\n   - 2 m^3 of bricks: 4000 kg\n   - 4 m^3 of bricks: 8000 kg \n   - 6000 m^3 of air: 6000 kg\n   - 10,000 m^3 of air: 10,000 kg\nThe lowest mass is 2 m^3 of bricks at 4000 kg.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
