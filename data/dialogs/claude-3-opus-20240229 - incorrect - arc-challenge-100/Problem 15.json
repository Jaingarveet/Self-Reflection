The substances in a mixture retain their own chemical identities and properties.\n2. Looking at the choices:\n   A) A mixture is indeed made up of more than one substance. This could be correct.\n   B) In a mixture, it is usually possible to separate the components by physical means like sorting, filtration, etc. So this choice is incorrect.  \n   C) In a mixture, the components do retain their original properties. This could also be correct.\n   D) In a mixture, the components are not chemically combined. They exist as separate substances. So this is incorrect.\n3. Between A and C, both are true characteristics of mixtures. However, C is a more specific and complete description of why this snack mix is a mixture.\nTherefore, the best answer is C - the snack is a mixture because the components (peanuts, seeds, raisins, etc.) retain their original properties.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
