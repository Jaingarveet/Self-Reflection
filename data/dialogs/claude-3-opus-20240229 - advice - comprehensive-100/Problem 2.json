        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide. With x pickets, the total width of the pickets is:\n   1/2 * x = x/2 inches\n2. There are x pickets, so there are x-1 spaces between them. Each space is 6 inches wide.\n   The total width of the spaces is:\n   6 * (x-1) = 6x - 6 inches\n3. The total length of the fence is the sum of the picket widths and space widths:\n   x/2 + 6x - 6 inches\n4. Simplify by factoring out common terms:\n   x/2 + 6x - 6\n   = (1/2)x + 6x - 6\n   = (1/2 + 6)x - 6\n   = 13x/2 - 6 inches\n5. Convert to feet by dividing by 12:\n   (13x/2 - 6)/12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 feet\n6. Simplify to match answer choices:\n   13x/24 - 1/2\n   = 13x/24 - 12/24\n   = (13x - 12)/24 feet\nTherefore, the length of the fence in feet is (13x - 12)/24.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
