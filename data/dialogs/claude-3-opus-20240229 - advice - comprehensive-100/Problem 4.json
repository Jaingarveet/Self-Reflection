Understand the given information:\n   * The space shuttle's maximum speed allows it to travel 700m high in 40 seconds.\n   * It takes 5 seconds for the space shuttle to pass a point.\n2. Calculate the speed of the space shuttle:\n   * Speed = Distance ÷ Time\n   * Speed = 700m ÷ 40s = 17.5 m/s\n3. Find the length of the space shuttle:\n   * The length of the space shuttle is equal to the distance it travels in the time it takes to pass a point.\n   * Length = Speed × Time\n   * Length = 17.5 m/s × 5s = 87.5 m\n4. Choose the closest answer from the given choices:\n   * 87.5 m is closest to 75 m.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
