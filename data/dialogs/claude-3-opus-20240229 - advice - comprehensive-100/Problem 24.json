Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question and constraints carefully.\n - Always consider the implications of each constraint fully before moving on.\n - Always work through the problem sequentially and systematically.\n - If you reach a contradiction or impossible situation, backtrack and reconsider your assumptions.\n - Make sure your final answer satisfies all the given constraints.\n - If a constraint is in the form of an \"if-then\" statement, consider the implications of both the \"if\" and \"then\" parts carefully.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports. That leaves George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.\n2. Tuesday is the only day George can report. So George must give a morning report on Tuesday (since Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports).\n3. If Nina reports, then the next day Helen and Irving must both report (unless it's Wednesday). \n4. Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports. So if either reports, it must be in the morning.\n5. Let's try Nina reporting on Monday morning. Then Helen and Irving must report on Tuesday. But George must report on Tuesday morning, so this doesn't work.\n6. Let's try Nina reporting on Tuesday afternoon. Then Helen and Irving must report on Wednesday. This could work.\n7. If Nina reports Tuesday afternoon and Helen and Irving report Wednesday, then for Monday we need to pick from Olivia and Robert for the morning slot. Let's say Robert.\n8. So a possible schedule is:\n   Monday morning: Robert\n   Tuesday morning: George\n   Tuesday afternoon: Nina\n   Wednesday morning: Helen\n   Wednesday afternoon: Irving\nTherefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by Robert, George, and Helen respectively.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
