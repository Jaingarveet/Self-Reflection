So Robot 1 must be Type B.\n- Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize neither shapes nor colors. So Robot 2 must be Type C. \n- Looking at the answer choices:\nA) Both being Type C is inconsistent with Robot 1 being Type B. Eliminate A.\nB) This matches the information - Robot 1 is Type B, Robot 2 is Type C. Keep B as a possibility for now.\nC) Robot 2 being Type B contradicts it picking up the blue balls. Eliminate C.\nD) Robot 1 not being Type B contradicts it picking up the red squares. Eliminate D.\nTherefore, B is the only answer choice that fits all the given information. Robot 1 must be Type B and Robot 2 must be Type C.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
