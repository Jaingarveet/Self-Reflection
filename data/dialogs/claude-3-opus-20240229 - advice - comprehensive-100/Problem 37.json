        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.\n - Focus on the facts directly stated, not just the implications you draw.\n - Be careful not to overemphasize tangential or less relevant information.\n - Always re-evaluate all the choices after your initial selection.\n - The correct answer will be strongly and directly supported, not just potentially inferred.\n - Avoid making assumptions beyond what is clearly implied by the passage.\n - Remember that the question asks what is most supported, not just possibly true.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe key facts stated in the passage are:\n1) Cat allergies are caused by certain proteins in cats' skin secretions and saliva\n2) The specific proteins people are allergic to varies from person to person \n3) All cats shed skin and spread saliva in their environment\n4) There are no cats that cannot cause allergies at all\n5) A specific cat may cause allergies in some people allergic to cats, but not all\nLooking at each answer choice:\nA) This is not strongly supported. The passage indicates allergies depend on the proteins and the person, not cat breeds.\nB) This matches fact #5 - a given cat won't cause allergies for every single person allergic to cats in general. So this is well supported.\nC) While this may potentially be true, the passage does not directly state or strongly imply that cats differ in their allergy-causing proteins.\nD) The passage does not discuss or compare the intensity of allergic reactions.\nE) This contradicts fact #5. We're told a cat may cause reactions in some allergy sufferers but not others, so reactions aren't totally unpredictable.\nAfter carefully evaluating each choice against the passage, B is most directly and strongly supported by the information provided.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
