        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly determined that Young must be in space #1 or #2, and that Togowa must be in the other of those two spaces. However, I then incorrectly focused on the relationship between Xu and Souza, ignoring the key fact that Robertson was assigned space #3. Since Robertson is in space #3, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, Young must be assigned space #2 (since #1 is the only lower number than #3), and Togowa must therefore be assigned space #1.\n"

One rule states that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. \n3. Since Robertson is in space #3, Young must be in either space #1 or #2 to satisfy this rule.\n4. Another rule states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. \n5. Since Young is in either space #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the other of these two spaces to satisfy this rule.\n6. If Young is in space #2, then Togowa must be in space #1. This is the only arrangement that satisfies both rules involving Young and Togowa, given that Robertson is in space #3.\nTherefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #2.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
