At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning about the relative positions of books O and M. I incorrectly assumed that there was not enough information to determine if O was on a higher shelf than M. However, the given conditions state that O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Since there are only 3 shelves, this means O must be on a higher shelf than M.\n"

There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom).\n2. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n3. I is on the middle shelf.\n4. K is on a higher shelf than F.\n5. O is on a higher shelf than L.\n6. F is on the same shelf as M.\nNow, focusing on the key insight:\n- O is higher than L (given)\n- F is on the same shelf as M (given)\n- There are only 3 shelves total\nTherefore, O must be on a higher shelf than both L and M. If O was on the same shelf as M, then it couldn't be on a higher shelf than L, since there are only 3 shelves.\nLooking at the answer choices, only A matches this deduction.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
