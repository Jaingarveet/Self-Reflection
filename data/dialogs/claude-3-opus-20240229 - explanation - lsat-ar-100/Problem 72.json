Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be\nChoices:\n  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant\n  B: the pharmacy and the toy store\n  C: the two restaurants\n  D: a restaurant and the toy store\n  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning about the positions of the businesses. I correctly identified that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist, and that the optometrist is next to the shoe store. However, I then incorrectly assumed that the second restaurant must be in the 6th position, which led me to incorrectly place the veterinarian and toy store.\n"

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is already next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be on the other side of the optometrist.\nSo far we have:\nPharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant\n4. The toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. The only spot left for the veterinarian is the 6th position. So the toy store must be in the 4th or 5th position.\n5. Putting this together, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
