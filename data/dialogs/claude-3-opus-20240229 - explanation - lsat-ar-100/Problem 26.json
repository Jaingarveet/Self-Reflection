Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.\n2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means the third and fourth solos could both be traditional pieces. \n3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. So if the third and fourth are the consecutive traditional pieces, the fourth would have to be performed by Wayne.\n4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly impact the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.\n5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the first or second solo before any traditional pieces can be played.\n6. With the above conditions, it's possible that Wayne only performs modern pieces in the first and/or second solo, while Zara performs the traditional pieces in the third and fourth solos. \n7. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece could be zero. He is not required to perform any traditional pieces based on the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
