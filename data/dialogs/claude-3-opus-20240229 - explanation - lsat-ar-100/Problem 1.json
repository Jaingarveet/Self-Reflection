Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly determined that choice [REDACTED] was possible, but it actually violates the conditions.

This is also a fixed condition.\n3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. So Monday cannot be empty.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday. \n5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\nNow let's look at each choice:\nA. Franco being the only witness on Monday is possible. It satisfies all conditions.\nB. Franco testifying the same day as Iturbe (Wednesday) is possible. It satisfies all conditions.\nC. Garcia and Hong both testifying Tuesday is possible. It would satisfy the \"exactly two on Tuesday\" condition.\nD. Garcia being the only witness Monday, with Hong being one of two on Wednesday is possible. It satisfies all conditions.\nE. If Jackson testifies Tuesday, and two testify Monday, that would mean 3 testify Tuesday (Jackson + the required two). This violates the \"exactly two on Tuesday\" condition.\nTherefore, E is the only choice that CANNOT be true.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
