Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning about the possible assignments of representatives to zones. I focused too much on the representatives mentioned in the answer choices and didn't consider all possibilities for the unmentioned representatives. My reasoning led me to incorrectly eliminate some viable options and incorrectly validate an impossible option.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Parra and Tiao can't both be in Zone 1. Tiao and Udall can't both be in Zone 2. \n2. Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone.\n3. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. So Zone 3 must have at least 3 reps.\n4. Looking at the choices:\nA) Kim, Mahr - This is possible. The other 5 reps could be split 2-3 or 3-2 between Zones 1 and 2.\nB) Kim, Tiao - This is not possible. If Tiao is in Zone 3, Udall must be in Zone 1 or 3. But then Stuckey would also have to be in Zone 1 or 3, leaving only 2 reps for Zones 1 and 2 combined, which is not enough.\nC) Parra, Quinn - This is possible. The other 5 reps could be split 2-3 between Zones 1 and 2.\nD) Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This is not possible. Tiao and Udall can't be in the same zone.\nE) Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This works. Parra and Quinn are together, Stuckey and Udall are together, and there are 4 reps in Zone 3, more than in Zone 2. The remaining 3 reps can be split 2-1 or 1-2 between Zones 1 and 2.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
