The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of houses that CANNOT be shown consecutively in either order?\nChoices:\n  A: J, K\n  B: J, M\n  C: J, O\n  D: J, P\n  E: M, P\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly analyzed the constraints on when houses J and K could be shown. I failed to recognize that since J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\n"

The first two houses are shown in the morning, the next three in the afternoon, and the last two in the evening\nSince J must be shown in the evening (6th or 7th) and K cannot be shown in the morning (1st or 2nd), there is no way for J and K to be shown consecutively. If J is 6th, K cannot be 5th or 7th. If J is 7th, K cannot be 6th.\nTherefore, the pair of houses that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is J and K.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
