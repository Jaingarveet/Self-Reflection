The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI focused too much on the information given about specific students and plays, and failed to consider the implications of the total number of plays. There are only three plays in total, so Megregian reviewing at least 2 plays necessarily means he reviews more plays than Jiang.\n"

So Megregian must review at least 2 plays.\n3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the play(s) Jiang reviews must be different from the ones Megregian reviews.\n4. Since there are only 3 plays total, and Megregian reviews at least 2 of them, Jiang can review at most 1 play. \n5. Therefore, Megregian must review more plays than Jiang.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
