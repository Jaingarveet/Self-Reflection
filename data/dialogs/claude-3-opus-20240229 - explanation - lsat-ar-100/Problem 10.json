The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.

This eliminates choice D, which has 5 French works (3 novels + 2 plays).\n3. At least 3 novels but no more than 4 novels must be selected. Choices A, B, C, and E all satisfy this.\n4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. Choices B, C, and E satisfy this. Choice A has more Russian novels than French.\n5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. This eliminates choice B, which has both French plays and the Russian play.\nLooking at the remaining choices C and E:\nChoice C has 2 French novels, 2 Russian novels, and 2 French plays. This satisfies all conditions.\nChoice E has 3 French novels, 2 Russian novels, and 1 Russian play. This also satisfies all conditions.\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
