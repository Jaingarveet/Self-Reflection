        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information provided in the passage. I focused on the variability of allergic reactions among individuals, rather than considering the variability of proteins among cats.\nError Keywords:\n- Reading comprehension error\n- Misinterpretation error\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe passage states that the proteins responsible for allergic reactions vary from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva, which contain these proteins. This implies that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully and understand the information provided.\n2. Identify the key points in the passage.\n3. Understand the question and what it is asking.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the passage.\n5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the passage and the question carefully.\n- Understand the key points in the passage.\n- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the passage.\n- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the passage.\n- Practice logical reasoning and reading comprehension skills.\n"
