        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.\nQuestion: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?\nChoices:\n  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\n  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\n  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI selected an answer that seemed to support the expert's view rather than cast doubt on it. Choice B suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary, while I failed to recognize that Choice D provides evidence directly contradicting the expert's claim that the bridge must be demolished to allow giant ships to pass.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpreting answer choices\n - Failing to identify contradictory evidence \n - Focusing on irrelevant information\n - Confirmation bias\nSolution:\nThe expert asserts the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow giant ships to pass. \nChoice A supports this view by noting goods must be transported by road/rail due to large ships being unable to pass.\nChoice B casts some doubt by suggesting few large ships travel above Nanjing.\nChoice C also supports the expert by pointing out other bridges have the same low 24m clearance. \nHowever, Choice D directly contradicts the expert's key claim by stating that 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. This proves giant ships can in fact pass under the bridge, so demolishing it is not necessary.\nTherefore, Choice D raises the most doubt about the expert's view.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and expert's claim carefully.\n2. For each answer choice, determine if it supports, opposes, or is irrelevant to the expert's view.\n3. Look for choices that provide direct evidence contradicting a key part of the expert's assertion.\n4. Avoid choices that seem relevant but don't actually disprove the main claim.\n5. Avoid focusing only on choices that confirm your initial thoughts.\n6. Select the choice that most strongly calls the expert's conclusion into question.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the full question and understand the key claim you are evaluating.\n - Always consider each answer choice carefully and look for direct evidence that contradicts the main assertion.\n - Never just pick an answer because it seems related to the topic or matches your first instinct.\n - Always be on the lookout for your own potential biases and try to set them aside.\n - Never ignore an answer choice just because it doesn't fit your initial assumptions.\n"

Let's examine each answer choice:\nA: This supports the expert's view by suggesting large ships can't currently pass, so it doesn't raise doubts.\nB: This casts some doubt by implying few large ships travel above Nanjing anyway. However, it doesn't directly disprove the claim that the bridge prevents their passage.\nC: Noting other bridges are also low clearance supports the expert's point about dredging the waterway, so this doesn't raise doubts.\nD: This choice states that 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. This directly contradicts the expert's claim that the bridge must be demolished to enable giant ships to pass. If such large ships can already get through, then demolishing and rebuilding the bridge is not necessary.\nTherefore, choice D provides the strongest evidence against the expert's assertion.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
