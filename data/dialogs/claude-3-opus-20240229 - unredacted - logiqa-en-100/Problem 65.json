While option B provides a potential explanation, it does not directly address the inconsistency. The correct answer, option A, is more relevant in resolving the discrepancy.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of the question\n - Incorrect reasoning\n - Overlooking the most relevant information\n - Focusing on tangential details\nSolution:\n1. The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict drunk driving investigations and those without.\n2. Experts believe that strict drunk driving investigations can reduce traffic accidents.\n3. There seems to be an inconsistency between the survey results and expert opinion.\n4. Option A states that severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.\n5. This information helps explain the survey results. If strict investigations are only occurring in cities that already have a high incidence of accidents, it could explain why the accident rates are similar to cities without strict investigations.\n6. Option A directly addresses the inconsistency by providing a plausible reason for the survey results, making it the most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the main issue or inconsistency.\n2. Analyze each answer choice and determine how it relates to the main issue.\n3. Identify the answer choice that most directly addresses or resolves the inconsistency.\n4. Avoid choosing answers that provide tangential information or do not directly address the main issue.\n5. Re-read the question and the chosen answer to ensure it is the most relevant and helpful in eliminating the inconsistency.\nAdvice:\n - Always focus on the central issue or inconsistency presented in the question.\n - Look for the answer choice that most directly addresses or resolves the main problem.\n - Be cautious of answer choices that provide additional information but do not directly address the inconsistency.\n - Avoid getting sidetracked by tangential details or explanations that do not resolve the main issue.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and ensure that your chosen answer is the most relevant and helpful in eliminating the inconsistency.\n"
