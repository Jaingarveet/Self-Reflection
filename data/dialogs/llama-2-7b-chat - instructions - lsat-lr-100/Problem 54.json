I overlooked the possibility that Hana's change of mind could be justified by a change in circumstances (Option A).\n2. I assumed that the fact of someone's presence at the birthday party guaranteed that they had a legitimate reason to be there (Option B).\n\nTo correctly answer the question, I will consider the possibility that Hana's change of mind could be justified by a change in circumstances. This means that it is possible that Hana's brothers were among the guests at her birthday party despite her initial decision not to invite them. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances.\n\nAnswer: (A) disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances."
