However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. Pluto is a celestial body that is both a moon (of Neptune) and a planet (in its own orbit around the sun). Therefore, Choice A is not the correct answer.\n\nI then considered Choice B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets. This choice seems plausible, as Pluto has an atmosphere and orbits the sun, but it is not a true planet. However, I realize that this answer does not take into account the fact that Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was ejected from that orbit when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity.\n\nNext, I considered Choice C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon. This choice seems unlikely, as Pluto's orbit around the sun is a result of its ejection from Neptune's orbit, and it is not possible to know what its orbit would have been if it had not been ejected.\n\nI then considered Choice D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet. While it is true that the size of a celestial body is not the sole determining factor of whether it is a true planet, it is important to consider the size of Pluto in relation to other celestial bodies in the solar system. Pluto is larger than many asteroids, but it is smaller than many other planets in the solar system.\n\nFinally, I considered Choice E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively. While it is true that many planets in the solar system formed in orbit around the sun exclusively, it is not a requirement for a celestial body to be a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune, but it is still considered a planet in its own right.\n\nBased on my self-reflection, the correct answer is Choice B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets. This answer takes into account the fact that Pluto has an atmosphere and orbits the sun, but it is not a true planet due to its formation in orbit around Neptune and its subsequent ejection from that orbit."
