Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.\n  C: Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly. Thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment.\n  D: Some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend.

Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI mistakenly assumed that the argument was based on a false premise, which led me to choose the incorrect answer. Upon further examination, I realized that the argument is actually based on a valid premise, and the conclusion follows logically.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I will use the following reasoning:\n\nThe argument states that \"only a minority of those who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice.\" This statement is true, but it does not necessarily follow that some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument in (A) is similar to the original argument in that it makes a generalization about a particular group of people. In this case, the argument states that most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes, which implies that some scholars may be motivated by other factors.\n\nJust like in the original argument, this statement does not necessarily imply that some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action. It simply means that most scholars are not motivated by the desire to win prestigious academic prizes, which does not necessarily affect the conclusion of the argument.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A): Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars."
