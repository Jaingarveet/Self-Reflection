The country being discussed is [REDACTED].\n2. Based on the statements provided, the climate conditions of the country are as follows:\n* It is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate.\n* It is difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate.\n* In most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.\n3. Based on the information provided, the most likely option to be false is (D) It is not possible to raise cacti in the country. This is because the statement indicates that it is easy to grow cacti in most parts of the country, which contradicts the idea that it is not possible to raise cacti there.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
