Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose \"unyielding,\" because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.\n\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the argumentative technique employed above?\n\nChoices:\n\nA: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in fact\nB: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\nC: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives\nD: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\nE: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion\n\nReflection:\n\nAfter initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on my solution and realized that it did not accurately describe the argumentative technique employed in the given context. I then re-read the passage and realized that the correct answer is (B): rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argumentative technique employed in the passage is to reject a factic (i.e., a fact that is relevant to the issue at hand) on the grounds that it makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question. This is the best description of the technique used in the passage, as the author argues that the factic in question makes it difficult for the group to reach a consensus, rather than attacking the character of a person or being less offensive than other alternatives. Therefore, the correct answer is (B)."
