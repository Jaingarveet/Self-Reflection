Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\n\nProblem:\nThe statements given are:\n\n1. Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n2. Most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\n\nSolution:\nI initially thought that statement B must be true, as it seems to logically follow from the given statements. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the case.\n\nCorrect Answer:\nThe correct answer is statement E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nExplanation:\nThe given statements imply that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. However, this does not necessarily mean that every film that won a prize at an international film festival was also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, there must be at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival but was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\n[REDACTED]"
