However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him.\nQuestion: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him.\n  B: Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing.\n  C: After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case.\n  D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.\n  E: Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument above suggests that if the company obtained the evidence of Ellison's illegal transactions by illegally recording his conversations, then it cannot justifiably take punitive measures against him. This is because the company's actions were illegal, and therefore, it cannot use that evidence to justify punishing Ellison.\n\nOption (E) best illustrates this principle. In this scenario, Ramirez was forced to admit her lies by the discovery of new evidence. However, the board of directors has previously pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties. Therefore, the board cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, as their actions were illegal and unjustified.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because Price's guilt does not justify Long's illegal actions. Option (B) is also incorrect because Shakila's past actions of illegally receiving cable television do not justify her not reporting her secretary's illegal activity. Option (C) is incorrect because Takashi's past actions of sneaking out do not justify Sarah's punishment in this scenario. Option (D) is incorrect because Kuttner's illegal animal traps were set on his own land, and the conservation officer cannot punish him for that."
