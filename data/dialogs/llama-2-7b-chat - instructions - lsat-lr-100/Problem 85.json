I selected choice (C) as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the given information.\n\nCorrect Answer: The most support for the president's prediction is provided by choice (A). According to the passage, Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially. This suggests that the new copy protection feature will help increase sales, which in turn will help Ditalgame recoup its investment.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage does not provide any information to support choices (B), (C), or (D). Choice (B) is irrelevant to the discussion, as the passage does not provide any information about the market size or Ditalgame's share of it. Choice (C) is also not supported by the passage, as it suggests that the copy protection feature will cause people to enjoy the game so much that they decide they have to have it, which is not a reliable way to increase sales. Choice (D) is also not relevant, as there is no information provided about Game Review Monthly's opinion on Ditalgame's games.\n\n[REDACTED]"
