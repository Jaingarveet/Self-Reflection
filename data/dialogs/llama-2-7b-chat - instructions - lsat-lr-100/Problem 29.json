I realized that the argument is based on the assumption that acquiring complete and detailed information about a product is difficult and expensive. Therefore, the conclusion that consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are behaving rationally is drawn.\n\nThe correct answer is (C): The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. This is because the argument is based on the assumption that acquiring detailed information is difficult and expensive, and therefore, it is rational for consumers to not bother to acquire such information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so."
