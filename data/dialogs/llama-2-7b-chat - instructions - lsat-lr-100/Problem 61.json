The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

I realized that the correct answer is (E) The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage suggests that the difference in performance between Group A and Group B is due to the age of the individuals, with Group A consisting of older adults and Group B consisting of college students. The fact that Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than Group B is likely due to the age difference. However, the passage does not provide any information about the timing of the instructions given to the two groups.\n\nIf the instructions were given at different times, it could have affected the performance of both groups. For example, if the instructions were given earlier to Group B, they may have had more time to forget the instructions and make more lapses. In contrast, Group A may have had more time to remember the instructions and make fewer lapses. Therefore, the timing of the instructions is crucial in establishing the conclusion that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\n\nTherefore, option (E) is the least helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn, as it does not provide any information about the timing of the instructions given to the two groups."
