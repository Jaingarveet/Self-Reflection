The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either\nChoices:\n  A: F or else K\n  B: F or else M\n  C: K or else M\n  D: M or else Q\n  E: P or else Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy mistake was that I did not consider all the conditions while selecting the answer. \nIf both G and H are selected, then we can't select F, K, and M together. \nIf we select F, then we can't select more than one zoologist. \nIf we select K, then we can't select M. \nIf we select M, then we must select both P and R. \nIf we select H, then we can't select F and M together. \nTherefore, the panel must include either F or K. \nError Keywords:\n - Missed conditions\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nIf both G and H are selected, then we can't select F, K, and M together. \nIf we select F, then we can't select more than one zoologist. \nIf we select K, then we can't select M. \nIf we select M, then we must select both P and R. \nIf we select H, then we can't select F and M together. \nTherefore, the panel must include either F or K. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify all the conditions and constraints.\n3. Analyze the problem step-by-step.\n4. Consider all possible scenarios.\n5. Eliminate the impossible scenarios.\n6. Choose the answer that satisfies all the conditions.\n7.
