        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning. \nIf M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. \nIf F or G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. \nHowever, H cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. \nTherefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. \nThus, the correct answer is E.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of the condition\n - Logical error\n - Misreading of the question\nSolution:\nIf M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. \nIf more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. \nH cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. \nTherefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. \nThus, the correct answer is E.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the conditions and constraints given in the problem.\n3. Reason through the problem step-by-step.\n4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the conditions and constraints given in the problem.\n - Always reason through the problem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving problems.\n"
