        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown in the evening.\n  B: L is shown in the afternoon.\n  C: L is shown in the evening.\n  D: M is shown in the morning.\n  E: M is shown in the afternoon.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. I thought that L could be shown before K, which is incorrect. \nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstood rule\n - Misinterpreted rule\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nJ is shown in the evening, so J is the sixth or seventh house.\nK cannot be shown in the morning, so K is the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.\nL must be shown after K and before M, so L is the fourth or fifth house.\nM is the fifth, sixth, or seventh house.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is that L is shown in the afternoon.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the rules and constraints given in the problem.\n3. Use logic to eliminate options that cannot be true.\n4. Identify the option that must be true based on the given rules and constraints.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the rules and constraints given in the problem.\n - Always use logic to eliminate options that cannot be true.\n - Always identify the option that must be true based on the given rules and constraints.\n - Never assume any information that is not given in the problem.\n - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is a key skill in solving problems.\n"
