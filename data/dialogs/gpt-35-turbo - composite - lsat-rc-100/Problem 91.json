        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?\nQuestion: The author of passage A would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements concerning the plan described in lines 41-47 in passage B?\nChoices:\n  A: Officials should not implement the plan until just after the legislature's annual appropriations hearing.\n  B: At least the plan would have a lower social cost than would turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.\n  C: The plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.\n  D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills.\n  E: Instead of implementing the plan, specific laws regarding the payment of water bills should be introduced to provide a more effective set of incentives.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the argument presented in Passage [REDACTED]. While I recognized that Passage [REDACTED] discussed the technique of discretionary nonenforcement, I did not fully grasp its implications for the plan described in Passage [REDACTED]. \nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding\n - Failure to grasp implications\n - Insufficient knowledge\nSolution:\nThe author of Passage [REDACTED] argues that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique that can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion. The plan described in Passage [REDACTED] involves selectively cutting water to residences with outstanding bills, which could be seen as an example of overenforcement. While the author of Passage [REDACTED] does not explicitly comment on this plan, they would likely agree with the statement that the plan has a lower social cost than turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time. However, the author would also likely argue that a better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills, as this would be a more effective method of collecting debts and would not involve the social costs of turning off water to households. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand the argument presented in each passage.\n2. Identify the key points of each passage and how they relate to the question.\n3. Consider how the argument presented in one passage might apply to the plan described in the other passage.\n4. Choose the answer that best reflects the author's perspective on the plan described in Passage [REDACTED].\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the argument presented in both passages.\nAdvice:\n - Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n - Pay close attention to the argument presented in each passage and how it relates to the question.\n - Consider how the argument presented in one passage might apply to the other passage.\n - Look for keywords and phrases that indicate the author's perspective on the issue.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the argument presented in both passages.\n"
