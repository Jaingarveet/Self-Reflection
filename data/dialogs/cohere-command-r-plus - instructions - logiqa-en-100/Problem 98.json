Understand the argument's focus on the relationship between rules/regulations and judgments of right and wrong.\n2. Recognize the argument's acknowledgment of varying rules and their potential misalignment with intrinsic morality.\n3. Interpret each choice in the context of the argument's broader themes.\n4. Identify which choice emphasizes the intrinsic and universal nature of moral conscience while acknowledging varying regulations.\n5. Select the choice that aligns with the argument's exploration of the complex interplay between rules and morality.\n"
