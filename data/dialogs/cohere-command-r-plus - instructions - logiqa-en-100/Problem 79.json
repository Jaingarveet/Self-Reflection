Understand the argument presented and identify its key claims and evidence.\n2. Interpret what it means for a choice to \"constitute doubt or rebuttal\" to the argument.\n3. Analyze each choice:\n   - [REDACTED]: Consider if it questions or challenges the argument's assumptions or conclusions.\n   - [REDACTED]: Assess if it directly refutes the argument's claim or raises a significant doubt.\n   - [REDACTED]: Evaluate if it aligns with or supports the argument's reasoning.\n   - [REDACTED]: Examine if it offers an alternative explanation or challenges the argument's core premise.\n4. Recognize that a rebuttal or doubt should directly engage with and challenge the argument's central claim or evidence.\n5. Avoid narrow interpretations and consider the broader implications and connections.\n"

Choice \"C\" is a rebuttal because it challenges the argument's assumption that visual experiences are always reliable, using the example of a mirage to illustrate an illusion within these experiences.\n\nThought: \nThe argument claims that the existence of an external world can be supported by sensory experiences, particularly visual ones, and that this world is consistently experienced by others as well. \n\nTo \"constitute doubt or rebuttal\" means to question, challenge, or raise significant doubts about the argument's assumptions or conclusions.\n\nChoice A questions the validity of using sensory evidence by pointing out a potential circular argument, marking it as a doubt.\nChoice B directly challenges the argument's claim about others' similar visual experiences, constituting a rebuttal.\nChoice C brings up the concept of illusions, indicating that visual experiences may not always be reliable, and is therefore a rebuttal.\nChoice D acknowledges the practical success of natural science, which aligns with the argument's reasoning about the external world and does not raise doubts or rebuttals.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \"D\".\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
