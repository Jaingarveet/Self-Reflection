Determine the gap in information: why is Ye Shi necessary if the official history is the emperor's diary?\n3. Analyze the options: which choice fills this gap and provides the missing link?\n4.

However, upon reflection, the argument actually promotes reading Ye Shi in addition to the official history, and choice D provides the most logical assumption that fills the gap in the argument's logic.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
