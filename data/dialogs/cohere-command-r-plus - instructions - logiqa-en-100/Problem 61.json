(1) There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.(2) F and G are not in charge of the same department.(3) H and I are not in charge of the same department.\nQuestion: If F and M are not in charge of the same department, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and H are in charge of the same department.\n  B: F and I are in charge of the same department.\n  C: I and P are in charge of the same department.\n  D: M and G are in charge of the same department.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully interpret the conditions provided: \n    - Only one assistant manages three departments (implying a single individual).\n    - F and G cannot share a department.\n    - H and I cannot share a department.\n2. Consider the implications of F and M being in different departments. \n3. Assign G and M to the same department to satisfy the condition about F and G. \n4. Recognize that I and H must now take the remaining two departments to avoid pairings mentioned in the conditions. \n5. Observe that this arrangement satisfies all conditions, making [REDACTED] the correct answer.\n"
