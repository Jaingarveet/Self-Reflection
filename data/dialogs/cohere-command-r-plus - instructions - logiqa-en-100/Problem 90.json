Identify the relationship between economic development and enterprise competitiveness. \n2. Recognize the relationship between social stability and the establishment of social security systems. \n3. Understand the impact of paying social insurance premiums on enterprise competitiveness. \n4. Recognize the inherent contradiction between the country's goals and strategies. \n5.
