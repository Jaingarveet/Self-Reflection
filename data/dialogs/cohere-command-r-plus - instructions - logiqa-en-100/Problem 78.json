Identify the four distinct roles Mr. Chen's guests fill: \n    - Father's brother-in-law\n    - Brother-in-law's father\n    - Brother's mother-in-law\n    - Brother-in-law's brother\n2. Understand that these roles are not mutually exclusive, and each role can be filled by a different person. \n3. Realize that the brother-in-law's brother is not necessarily the same person as the brother's mother-in-law's husband, as they can be brothers married to different people. \n4. Count the number of guests invited (four) and select the answer choice reflecting that count.\n"
