Identify and clearly understand the inconsistency presented in the question. \n2. Recognize that the question seeks an explanation for the inconsistency, not a solution to reduce accidents. \n3. Evaluate each choice based on its ability to provide context or information that reconciles the inconsistent survey results. \n4. Choose the answer that best addresses the inconsistency by providing relevant and explanatory information.\n"

It could be that drunk driving has not been eliminated, but that does not explain why accident rates are similar.\n\nC offers an alternative explanation by suggesting that driver education may be a more effective factor in reducing accidents than strict enforcement alone. This reconciles the survey findings as it suggests an alternative factor influencing accident rates, providing a plausible explanation for why strict investigations may not have resulted in a noticeable difference in accident rates.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
