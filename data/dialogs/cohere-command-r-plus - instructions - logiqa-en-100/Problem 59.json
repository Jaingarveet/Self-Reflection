F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and the other three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?\nChoices:\n  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X\n  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y\n  C: Public Relations Department?

Identify the given conditions and understand their implications. \n2. Deduce the possible allocations for each employee based on the conditions. \n3. Evaluate each choice systematically, checking if it satisfies all the conditions. \n4. Ensure that your interpretation of the conditions is correct, especially the relationships between employees. \n5. Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the conditions.\n"

When considering condition (3), it's important to recognize that it doesn't dictate X's department but rather specifies the relationship between X and W's departments. This means that if X is in Sales, then W must be in Production, but W can still be allocated to Sales if X is not in Sales.\n\nThought: Given the conditions:\n1. H and Y must be in the same department.\n2. F and G cannot be in the same department.\n3. If X is in Sales, then W must be in Production.\n4. F must be in the Production department.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\nA: This satisfies all the conditions. H and Y are together, F and G are in different departments, and F is in Production. X is in Sales, so W must be in Production according to condition (3).\n\nB: This does not satisfy condition (4) as F is not in the Production department.\n\nC: This violates condition (2) as F and G are in the same department.\n\nD: This violates condition (3) as X is in Sales but W is not in Production.\n\nTherefore, the final allocation that satisfies all the conditions is Choice A.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
