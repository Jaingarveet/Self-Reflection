Identify the contradiction in the survey results.\n2. Understand that the options provide potential reasons for this contradiction.\n3. Analyze each choice to determine its relevance to resolving the contradiction. \n4. Recognize that choice [REDACTED] addresses the discrepancy between favorable views and actual hiring intentions.\n5. Interpret the statistical insights correctly:\n - 69% (favor) vs. 31% (better service) reveals a disconnect.\n - People like the idea, but not for superior service.\n6. Understand that choice [REDACTED] provides the most reasonable explanation for the contradiction.\n"
