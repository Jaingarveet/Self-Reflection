Context: The context discusses the thinking processes of scientists, specifically the idea that Nobel Prize winners utilize \"image thinking\" methods (analogy, intuition, epiphany) more often than general scientists, which may contribute to their significant scientific breakthroughs.\n2. Conclusion: The conclusion is that \"image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.\"\n\n3. Assumption: The assumption underlying this conclusion is that Nobel Prize winners have achieved major scientific breakthroughs, and their success is attributed, at least in part, to their use of \"image thinking\" methods.\n\n4. Analysis: \nChoice A discusses logical reasoning, which is not the primary focus of the argument; it doesn't reflect the assumption that \"image thinking\" leads to breakthroughs.\nChoice B acknowledges the creative thinking of Nobel laureates but doesn't connect it explicitly to significant achievements.\nChoice C directly addresses the assumption by stating that Nobel winners have made major breakthroughs, implying that their use of \"image thinking\" methods contributed to their success.\nChoice D introduces a new element of comparison (smarter and harder) that is not relevant to the argument's focus on thinking methods and breakthroughs.\n\nTherefore, choice C is the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
