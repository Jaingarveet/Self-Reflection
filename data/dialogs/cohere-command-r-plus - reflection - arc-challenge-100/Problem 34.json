Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the question and jumped to a conclusion. I focused on the phrase \"limited testing\" and assumed that the next logical step would be to expand the testing to humans. However, the question asks for a way to \"strengthen their conclusions,\" implying that the focus should be on the validity and reproducibility of the existing results rather than immediate expansion to human trials.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Assumption\n- Human trials\n\nSolution:\nTo strengthen their conclusions, the researchers should focus on validating their findings. The most appropriate step is to engage an independent lab to retest the antibiotic. This step ensures reproducibility and provides additional confidence in the results.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Focus on the phrase \"strengthen their conclusions.\"\n2. Interpret \"limited testing\" as a need for validation and reproducibility.\n3. Recognize that engaging an independent lab addresses these concerns.\n4. Understand that reproducibility is a key aspect of scientific research.\n5. Interpret \"human volunteers\" as an unnecessary expansion at this stage.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the question carefully and identify the specific request.\n- Interpret the phrase \"limited testing\" accurately without jumping to conclusions.\n- Emphasize the importance of reproducibility and validation in scientific research.\n- Understand that engaging independent labs is a common practice to ensure unbiased results.\n- Recognize that expanding to human trials is a significant step that requires strong preliminary evidence."
