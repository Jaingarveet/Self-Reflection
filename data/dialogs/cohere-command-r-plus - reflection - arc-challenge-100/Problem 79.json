Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation: \nI incorrectly interpreted the term \"physical change\" in the context of digestion. I associated the mechanical process of breaking down food with chemical processes involving digestive juices. I overlooked the fact that \"physical change\" in this context refers to the mechanical movement and processing of food through the digestive system, which includes processes like peristalsis and the squeezing of food through the intestines.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Overlooking context\n - Ignoring mechanical processes\n\nSolution: \nDuring digestion, food undergoes physical and chemical changes. While digestive juices do play a crucial role in breaking down food substances chemically, the question specifically asks for a physical change. The correct answer, \"D,\" refers to the mechanical process of peristalsis, where the intestines contract to propel food forward, simulating a squeezing action.\n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the concept of physical and chemical changes during digestion.\n2. Interpret \"physical change\" in the context of digestion as mechanical processes.\n3. Recognize that \"squeezing of food through the intestines\" describes peristalsis, a mechanical process.\n4. Identify the answer choice that aligns with this understanding.\n\nAdvice: \n - Familiarize yourself with the various physical and chemical processes involved in digestion.\n - Understand the distinction between mechanical and chemical processes in this context.\n - Pay close attention to the specific wording and context of the question.\n - Avoid making assumptions or oversimplifying complex biological processes.\n - Always consider all answer options carefully before selecting the most appropriate one."
