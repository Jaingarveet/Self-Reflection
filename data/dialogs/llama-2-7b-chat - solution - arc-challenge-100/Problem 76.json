Upon further reflection, I understand that option D, coal, is the correct answer. Coal is a nonrenewable energy source that produces waste products such as ash, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, which can have long-term negative effects on Earth's subsystems, including air and water pollution.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
