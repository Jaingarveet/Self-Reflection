The correct calculation is:\n\nF = ma\n\nWhere F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object.

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is that the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force.\n\nTo calculate the acceleration of the object, I can use the formula F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. Since the larger force is acting in the same direction as the acceleration, the object will accelerate in that direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) move in the same direction as the larger force.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
