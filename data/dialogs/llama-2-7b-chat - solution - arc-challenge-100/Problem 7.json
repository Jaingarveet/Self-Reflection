If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?\nChoices:\n  A: 5 km\n  B: 20 km\n  C: 40 km\n  D: 50 km\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nTo find the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.\n\nThe question states that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so the speed of the geese is:\nspeed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day\n\nNow, to find the distance traveled on the first day, we can multiply the speed by the number of days the geese have been traveling:\ndistance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].\n"
