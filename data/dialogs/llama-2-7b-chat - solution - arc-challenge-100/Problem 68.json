I thought it was asking about a specific behavior of deer, but it's actually asking about an escape strategy used by newts. I will make sure to pay closer attention to the question and use the correct information to answer it correctly this time.\n\nSolution:\nTo answer the question correctly, I will research and learn about the behavior and adaptations of newts. I will learn about the mechanism of the escape strategy and how it helps newts avoid predators.\n\nAction:\nBased on my research, I have found that newts drop their tails when threatened as an escape strategy to avoid being eaten by predators. When a predator grabs the newt's tail, the newt can detach it and use it as a decoy to distract the predator while it escapes. This is an excellent example of an escape strategy used by newts to avoid being killed and eaten by predators. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Newts drop their tails when threatened."
