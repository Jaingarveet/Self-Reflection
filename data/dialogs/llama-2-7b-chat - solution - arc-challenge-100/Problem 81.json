The correct answer is (D) Look at the Sun only through a solar filter or projection screen. This is because the Sun emits intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation that can damage the retina and cause permanent eye damage. Using a very strong telescope or new equipment is not sufficient to protect the eyes, as the Sun's rays can still pass through the telescope or equipment and cause harm. Projecting the image onto a piece of cardboard is also not a safe option, as it can still expose the eyes to the Sun's rays.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
