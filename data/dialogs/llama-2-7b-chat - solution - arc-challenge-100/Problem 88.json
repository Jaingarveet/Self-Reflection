However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct solution. Michelle's hypothesis is a prediction based on her understanding of the phenomenon she is investigating, and it is important to test this hypothesis through the investigation. If the results do not match the hypothesis, it means that the hypothesis was incorrect, and Michelle should perform the investigation in a different way to gather more data or to refine her hypothesis.\n\n[REDACTED]"
