Erosion involves the removal of rocks and minerals from their original location through natural processes such as wind, water, or ice. These particles are then transported to a new location, where they are deposited, compacted, and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks.\n"

However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is deposition. Deposition is the first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks, as it involves the transportation and settling of sedimentary particles in a new location. Erosion, compaction, and cementation are subsequent steps in the process.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
