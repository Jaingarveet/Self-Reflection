However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer.\n\nTo determine the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use a thermometer to measure the temperature of the liquid at regular intervals until it reaches its boiling point. The time it takes for the liquid to reach its boiling point can then be measured using a stopwatch. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) a thermometer.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer, and I hope this reflection helps clarify the correct solution."
