However, since the pieces of metal have the same density, mass, and texture, their boiling points must be the same.\nNext, I considered (C) They are made up of a different type of matter, as different metals may have different chemical compositions. However, since the pieces of metal have the same density, mass, and texture, their chemical compositions must be the same.\nFinally, I realized that the only remaining difference between the two samples is their dimensions, as they are the same in terms of density, mass, and texture. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) They have different dimensions.\n\nAny information that I am not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED]."
