How does the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly affect freshwater ecosystems?\nChoices:\n  A: increasing biodiversity\n  B: increasing water clarity\n  C: decreasing algae blooms\n  D: decreasing oxygen levels\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. Here is my reflection:\n\nI mistakenly chose option A, \"increasing biodiversity,\" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer. The addition of organic waste from fertilizers can actually lead to decreased biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. This is because excess nutrients from fertilizers can cause an overgrowth of certain aquatic plants and algae, which can outcompete other organisms for resources and habitat, leading to a decrease in biodiversity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, \"decreasing algae blooms.\" The addition of organic waste from fertilizers can lead to an overgrowth of algae in freshwater ecosystems, which can deplete the oxygen in the water, harm aquatic life, and reduce the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\n[REDACTED]"
