This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.\n  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.\n  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.\n  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\n  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Lack of attention to detail\n- Overlooking context\n"

I overlooked the fact that the defendant's excuse specifically pertained to confusion between the two sets of codes, and that this distinction was key to the judge's reasoning.\n\nThought: \nThe judge's reasoning hinges on the fact that the defendant's excuse of confusion between national and local building codes is irrelevant to the charge of noncompliance with national building codes. The defendant's ignorance of the specific code applicable in the area does not exempt him from responsibility for violating national building codes.\n\nChoice D captures this principle by stating that \"ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\" This directly addresses the defendant's excuse and explains why it is insufficient for avoiding penalties.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
