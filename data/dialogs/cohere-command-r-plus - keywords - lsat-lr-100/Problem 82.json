Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Scope error\n - Overlooking core argument\n - Demographic proportions\n"

The correct answer should directly counter this implication and reinforce Patricia's original statement.\n\nThought: \nPatricia argues that there was little ninja activity and fear during the Tokugawa period. Tamara's objection suggests that people took precautions, indicating a fear of ninjas. To counter this, Patricia could point out that the wealthy, who could afford such houses, were a small portion of the population, and thus the construction of squeaky floors does not reflect widespread fear among the general public.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
