What is the value of 50% of that number?\nChoices:\n  A: 22.5\n  B: 84\n  C: 21\n  D: 24\n  E: 25\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly solved for x, but I made an error in calculating 50% of x. \nI multiplied x by 50% instead of dividing it by 2. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Multiplication error\n - Percentage error\nSolution:\nLet's assume the number is \"x\".\nAccording to the problem, (x - 30) = (1/3)x.\nSolving for x, we get x = 60.\nNow, we need to find 50% of x, which is (50/100)x = (1/2)x = (1/2)60 = 30.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.\n2. Identify the unknown value and assign it a variable.\n3. Translate the problem into an equation.\n4. Solve the equation to find the value of the unknown variable.\n5. Double-check your calculations.\n6. Use the value of the unknown variable to answer the question.\n7. Check your answer against the choices provided.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that percentages can be expressed as fractions or decimals.\n - Remember that finding a percentage of a number involves multiplying the number by the percentage expressed as a decimal or fraction.\n"
