Identify the time interval for each train.\n2. Find the LCM of the two time intervals.\n3. The LCM is the time it takes for both trains to leave the station simultaneously again.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the relevant information in the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula or method to solve the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the LCM is the smallest multiple that two or more numbers have in common.\n"
