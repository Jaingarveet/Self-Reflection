Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, after which they were all returned to the bag. If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold?\nChoices:\n  A: 40\n  B: 200\n  C: 380\n  D: 400\n  E: 3200\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a calculation error while calculating the total number of marbles in the bag.\nI correctly calculated the percentage of black marbles in the bag but made an error in calculating the total number of marbles.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Percentage error\n - Arithmetic error\nSolution:\nInitially, the bag had only white marbles.\n20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, so there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.\nThe total number of marbles in the bag is Q.\nThe percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 * 100 = 5%.\nLet's assume the total number of marbles in the bag is Q.\nSo, 5% of Q is equal to 1 black marble.\nTherefore, 5% of Q = 1.\nHence, Q = 20 / 0.05 = [REDACTED]0.\nThe total number of marbles in the bag is [REDACTED]0.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the relevant information and variables.\n3. Think through the problem step-by-step.\n4. Calculate the percentage of the relevant variable.\n5. Use the percentage to calculate the total number of the variable.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the relevant information and variables.\n - Always think through the problem step-by-step.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that percentages are calculated by dividing the part by the whole and multiplying by 100.\n"
