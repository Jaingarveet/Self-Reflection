In how many ways can you travel from M to Q ?\nChoices:\n  A: 24\n  B: 36\n  C: 72\n  D: 84\n  E: None\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy thought process and solution were correct. However, I made a calculation error. The product of 3, 4, 1, and 3 is [REDACTED], not [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Multiplication error\nSolution:\nThe number of ways to travel from M to Q is the product of the number of ways to travel from M to N, from N to O, from O to P, and from P to Q.\nFrom M to N, there are 3 buses.\nFrom N to O, there are 4 buses.\nFrom O to P, there is 1 bus.\nFrom P to Q, there are 3 buses.\nThe total number of ways to travel from M to Q is 3 x 4 x 1 x 3 = [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the number of buses from M to N.\n2. Identify the number of buses from N to O.\n3. Identify the number of buses from O to P.\n4. Identify the number of buses from P to Q.\n5. Multiply the number of buses from M to N by the number of buses from N to O by the number of buses from O to P by the number of buses from P to Q.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.\n"
