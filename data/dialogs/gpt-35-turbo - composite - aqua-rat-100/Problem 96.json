At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 months\n  B: 4 months\n  C: 23 months\n  D: 24 months\n  E: 84 months\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy calculation was incorrect. \nI did not use the correct ratio of investments to calculate the share of profit for each person. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Ratio error\n - Investment error\nSolution:\nLet's assume [REDACTED] joined the business after x months.\n[REDACTED] invested for the entire year, so his share of the profit is (12/12) = 1.\n[REDACTED] invested for 10 months (12-2), so his share of the profit is (10/12) = 5/6.\n[REDACTED] invested for (12-x) months, so his share of the profit is ((12-x)/12).\nThe sum of their shares of the profit is 1 + 5/6 + ((12-x)/12) = 375000/150000 = 2.5.\nSimplifying the equation, we get (24 + 20 + 12 - 2x)/24 = 5/2.\nSolving for x, we get x = 4.\nTherefore, [REDACTED] joined the business after [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the investments of each person and the duration of their investments.\n2. Use the ratio of their investments to calculate the share of profit for each person.\n3. Add up their shares of the profit to get the total profit.\n4. Set up an equation using the total profit and the sum of their shares of the profit.\n5. Simplify the equation and solve for the unknown variable.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct ratio of investments to calculate the share of profit for each person.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the sum of their shares of the profit should be equal to 1.\n"
