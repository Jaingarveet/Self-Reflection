        "content": "Action: Answer(\"E\") \nUsing the given information, we can find that 1 roll is equivalent to 3/2 pita breads. We can also find that 1 roll is equivalent to 5/3 baguettes. Therefore, 1 baguette is equivalent to (5/3)/(3/2) = 10/9 pita breads. Finally, 2 baguettes are equivalent to 20/9 pita breads, which simplifies to 2 and 2/9 pita breads. Therefore, the answer is E) 25/3."
