        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1m more than the 4 times the breadth. What is the perimeter of the piece?\nChoices:\n  A: 60 m\n  B: 61 m\n  C: 62 m\n  D: 63 m\n  E: 64 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in calculating the perimeter of the rectangular piece. \nI correctly calculated the length and breadth of the rectangular piece but made an error in the final calculation of the perimeter. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Perimeter error\n - Addition error\nSolution:\nLet's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is \"x\" meters.\nThen, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters.\nWe know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.\nSo, x(4x + 1) = 150\nSimplifying the above equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0\nWe can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x.\nOnce we have the value of x, we can calculate the length and perimeter of the rectangular piece.\nSolving the quadratic equation, we get x = 5 or x = -7.5\nSince the breadth cannot be negative, we will consider x = 5.\nSo, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 = 21 meters.\nThe perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 meters.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given information and what needs to be calculated.\n3. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n4. Use algebraic equations to represent the problem.\n5. Solve the equations step-by-step.\n6. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to use the correct formula for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle.\n - Remember to add the length and breadth of the rectangle before multiplying by 2.\n"
