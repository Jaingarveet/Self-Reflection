The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 43 + 45 + [REDACTED] + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + [REDACTED] = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem and what is being asked.\n2. Identify the formula for the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n3. Remember that the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.\n4. Remember that if the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.\n5. Remember that the only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.\n6. Check each given number to see if it can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n7. Use the formula to calculate the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n8. Check if the sum is divisible by 10.\n9. Choose the answer that matches the number that can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nAdvice:\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always check your work to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember to use the correct formula for the problem.\n - Remember to check each given number to see if it can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n - Remember to use the divisibility rules to check if the sum is divisible by 10.\n"
