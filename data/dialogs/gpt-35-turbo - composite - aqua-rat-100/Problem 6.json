After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\nChoices:\n  A: 7\n  B: 8\n  C: 10\n  D: 11\n  E: 12\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in calculating the fraction of work done by Mr.Black in a day. \nThe gap in my knowledge was in calculating fractions and ratios. \nI made a calculation error while adding the fractions. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Fraction error\n - Ratio error\n - Addition error\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.\nMr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.\nMr.Black can paint a house in [REDACTED] days, so he can paint 1/[REDACTED] of a house in a day.\nMr.Blue can paint a house in [REDACTED] days, so he can paint 1/[REDACTED] of a house in a day.\nAfter [REDACTED] days, Mr.Brown has completed [REDACTED]*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.\nNow, Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/[REDACTED]) = 3/4 of the work.\nTogether, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed (4/3 + 3/4) = 25/[REDACTED] of the work.\nThus, the remaining work is (1 - 25/[REDACTED]) = [REDACTED]/[REDACTED] of the work.\nLet's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.\nSo, in x days, Mr.Blue can complete (1/[REDACTED])*x of the work.\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n(1/[REDACTED])*x = [REDACTED]/[REDACTED]\nx = ([REDACTED]/[REDACTED])/(1/[REDACTED])\nx = [REDACTED]\nTherefore, it will take Mr.Blue [REDACTED] days to complete the contract.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.\n3. Add the fractions of work done by each painter to calculate the total work done.\n4. Subtract the total work done from 1 to find the remaining work.\n5. Set up an equation to solve for the remaining work.\n6. Solve the equation to find the time taken by the remaining painter to complete the work.\n[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always calculate fractions and ratios accurately.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that adding fractions requires a common denominator.\n"
