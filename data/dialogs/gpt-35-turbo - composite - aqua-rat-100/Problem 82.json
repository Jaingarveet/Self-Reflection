If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?\nChoices:\n  A: 51 days\n  B: 61 days\n  C: 71 days\n  D: 81 days\n  E: 91 days\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a calculation error while finding the area of the field. \nI used the diameter instead of the radius to calculate the area of the field.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Area calculation error\n - Diameter instead of radius\nSolution:\nThe rope tied to the cow is the radius of the circular area it can graze.\nThe area of the circle is pi*r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.\nWe need to find the area of the field and divide it by the area the cow can graze in a day.\nThe radius of the circle is 14/2 = 7 feet.\nThe area of the field is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*7^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places)\nThe time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is T = A/10 = 15.39 days (rounded to two decimal places)\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the radius of the circle that the cow can graze.\n2. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula [REDACTED] = pi*r^2.\n3. Identify the area that the cow can graze in a day.\n4. Divide the area of the field by the area that the cow can graze in a day.\n5. Round the result to the nearest whole number or decimal place, as required.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula for the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter.\n"
