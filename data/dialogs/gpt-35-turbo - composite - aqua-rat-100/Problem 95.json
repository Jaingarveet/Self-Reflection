Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.\nWhat is the final concentration of tea John drinks?\nChoices:\n  A: 15.38%\n  B: 42%\n  C: 39.86%\n  D: 22.35%\n  E: 32.51%\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a calculation error while calculating the concentration of tea after the second replacement. \nI forgot to subtract the percentage of milk from the resultant solution.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Arithmetic error\n - Concentration error\nSolution:\nJohn replaces 15% of 50% strong milk tea twice, which means he replaces 7.5% of tea with milk twice.\nAfter the first replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 42.5%.\nAfter the second replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 36.125%.\nThen, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.\nThe concentration of tea becomes 32.5125%.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the initial concentration of tea.\n2. Identify the percentage of milk John replaces twice.\n3. Calculate the concentration of tea after the first replacement.\n4. Calculate the concentration of tea after the second replacement.\n5. Calculate the concentration of tea after the third replacement.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that concentration is the amount of solute divided by the total amount of solution.\n"
