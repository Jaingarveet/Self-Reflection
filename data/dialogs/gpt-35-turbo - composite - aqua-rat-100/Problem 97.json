Identify the original amount and the reduced amount.\n2. Calculate the reduction amount by subtracting the reduced amount from the original amount.\n3. Use the formula (reduction amount / original amount) x 100 to calculate the reduction percent.\n4. Substitute the values and simplify the expression.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula for the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that percent means \"per hundred\" and can be calculated using the formula (part / whole) x 100.\n"
