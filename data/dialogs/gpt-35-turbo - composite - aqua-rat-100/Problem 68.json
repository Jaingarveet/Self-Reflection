If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\nChoices:\n  A: 242\n  B: 308\n  C: 352\n  D: 412\n  E: 456\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI used the wrong formula to solve the problem. Instead of using the formula that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM, I used the formula that the LCM of two numbers is equal to their product divided by their GCF. \nError Keywords:\n - Formula error\n - Computation error\n - Division error\nSolution:\nThe GCF of two numbers is 11.\nThe LCM of two numbers is 7700.\nOne of the numbers is 350.\nWe can find the other number by dividing the product of 350 and 7700 by 350 and then dividing by 11.\nThe other number is (350*7700)/350/11 = 700.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the GCF and LCM of the two numbers.\n2. Identify one of the two numbers.\n3. Use the formula that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM to find the other number.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula to solve the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.\n"
