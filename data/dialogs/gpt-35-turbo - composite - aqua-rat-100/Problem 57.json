What is the distance traveled, in centimeters, by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes?\nChoices:\n  A: 750pi\n  B: 1500pi\n  C: 1875pi\n  D: 3000pi\n  E: 7500pi\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly calculated the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds, but I made an error in calculating the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade. \nI multiplied the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 centimeters by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds, but I forgot to multiply by 2 because the point on the edge of the fan blade travels the circumference of the circle twice in one revolution.\nError Keywords:\n - Circumference error\n - Multiplication error\n - Misinterpretation error\nSolution:\nThe distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 centimeters multiplied by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds.\nThe circumference of a circle with a radius of 10 centimeters is 20π centimeters.\nThe fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, which is equal to 5 revolutions per second.\nTherefore, the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds is 5 x 30 = 150 revolutions.\nThe distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 2 x 20π x 10 x 150 = 6000π centimeters.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the radius of the circle.\n2. Calculate the circumference of the circle.\n3. Identify the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in the given time.\n4. Multiply the circumference of the circle by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade.\n5. Multiply the result by 2 because the point on the edge of the fan blade travels the circumference of the circle twice in one revolution.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the circumference of a circle is equal to 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.\n - Remember that the point on the edge of the fan blade travels the circumference of the circle twice in one revolution.\n"
