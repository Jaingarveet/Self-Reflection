If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?\nChoices:\n  A: 1 step/minute\n  B: 2 step/minute\n  C: 3 step/minute\n  D: 4 step/minute\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe elevator's speed is constant, so it cannot have two different values. \nThe error in my reasoning was that I assumed the elevator's speed was constant, but it was not. \nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Non-constant speed\nSolution:\nLet's assume that the speed of the elevator is \"x steps/minute\".\nFrom the first statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 20 steps. So, the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (20 steps)/(10 minutes) = 2 steps/minute.\nFrom the second statement, we can say that the elevator's speed is half of the speed in the first statement. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (2 steps/minute) / 2 = [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the unknown variable and assign a variable to it.\n3. Use the given information to create equations.\n4. Solve the equations to find the value of the unknown variable.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the unknown variable and assign a variable to it.\n - Always use the given information to create equations.\n - Always solve the equations to find the value of the unknown variable.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the speed is constant, so it cannot have two different values.\n"
