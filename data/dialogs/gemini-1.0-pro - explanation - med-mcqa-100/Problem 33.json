I have reviewed the question and my reasoning and have identified the error. \n**Previously, I incorrectly stated that the antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid is BP antigen 1 & 2.**\n**However, the correct answer is Epiligrin.**\n**Here's my reasoning:**\n* Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that targets the basement membrane zone of the skin.\n* The salt split skin technique is a diagnostic test used to identify the level of the blister formation.\n* In Cicatricial pemphigoid, the blister forms beneath the basement membrane zone, specifically within the lamina lucida.\n* Epiligrin is a major component of the lamina lucida and is the primary target antigen in Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n* IgG antibodies against Epiligrin are found on the epidermal side of the split in the salt split skin technique.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B: Epiligrin**.\n**I have learned from this mistake and will strive to provide accurate and reliable information in the future.**\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
