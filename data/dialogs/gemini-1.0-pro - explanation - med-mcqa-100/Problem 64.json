This can cause severe pain and, if left untreated, can lead to the loss of the ovary.\nDermoid cysts are the most common type of ovarian tumor. They are typically benign and contain a variety of tissues, including hair, teeth, and bone. Dermoid cysts are also the most likely type of ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy. This is because they are often attached to the ovary by a long, thin stalk, which makes them more susceptible to twisting.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
