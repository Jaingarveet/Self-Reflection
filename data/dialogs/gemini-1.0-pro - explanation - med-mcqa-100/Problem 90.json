I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly this time.\n**Thought:**\n* **Oligohydramnios:** This is a condition where there is too little amniotic fluid. This can cause the baby to have an unstable lie because there is not enough fluid to cushion the baby and allow it to move freely.\n* **Placenta previa:** This is a condition where the placenta is located in the lower part of the uterus, covering the cervix. This can cause the baby to have an unstable lie because the placenta can block the baby's head from engaging in the pelvis.\n* **Pelvic tumor:** This is a mass in the pelvis that can take up space and prevent the baby from engaging in the pelvis. This can cause the baby to have an unstable lie.\n* **Uterine anomalies:** These are abnormalities in the shape or size of the uterus. This can cause the baby to have an unstable lie because the uterus may not be able to accommodate the baby in a normal position.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most likely cause of an unstable lie in a 34-week multigravida with previous 2 normal deliveries is **oligohydramnios**. This is because oligohydramnios is a common cause of unstable lie, and it is more likely to occur in a multigravida than in a primigravida.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
