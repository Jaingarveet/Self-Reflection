I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Problem:** I incorrectly identified the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst as \"Hemorrhage.\"\n* **Solution:** I need to carefully review the potential complications of this procedure and identify the most likely and severe one.\n* **Correct Answer:** The major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst is **C: Fistula**.\n**Thought Process:**\n* Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the stomach.\n* A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels.\n* In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and the stomach, the small intestine, or the colon.\n* This can lead to leakage of pancreatic enzymes and digestive juices, causing inflammation, infection, and other complications.\n* While other complications like infection, obstruction, and hemorrhage can occur, they are less frequent and severe compared to fistula formation.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\") \n"
