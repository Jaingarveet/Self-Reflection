Which of the following points lies on the line?\nChoices:\n  A: $(0,7)$\n  B: $(1,7)$\n  C: $(7,7)$\n  D: $(14,2)$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly substituted the coordinates of the points into the equation, which led me to choose the wrong answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Reasoning error\n* Substitution error\n* Equation error\n\nSolution:\n[REDACTED] line with a slope of $\\frac{1}{7}$ and passes through the origin will have the equation $y = \\frac{1}{7}x$.\nWe can substitute the coordinates of the given points into this equation to determine which point lies on the line.\n\n* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=0$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \\frac{1}{7}(0) \\cdot 7$, which is not true.\n* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=1$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \\frac{1}{7}(1) \\cdot 7$, which is true.\n* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=7$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \\frac{1}{7}(7) \\cdot 7$, which is not true.\n* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=14$ and $y=2$ into the equation, we get $2 = \\frac{1}{7}(14) \\cdot 2$, which is true.\n\nTherefore, the point that lies on the line is [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Write down the equation of the line given the slope and the fact that it passes through the origin.\n2. Substitute the coordinates of each point into the equation and check if it is true.\n3. Choose the point that makes the equation true.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully read the question and understand the problem.\n* Always write down the equation of the line when given the slope and the fact that it passes through the origin.\n* Always substitute the coordinates of each point into the equation and check if it is true.\n* Never assume the answer without checking all the points.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n"

I incorrectly assumed that the point $(7,7)$ was on the line without properly substituting its coordinates into the equation. I also missed the fact that there were two points that satisfied the equation. This time, I carefully went through each point and checked if it was true. I also double-checked my calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy."
