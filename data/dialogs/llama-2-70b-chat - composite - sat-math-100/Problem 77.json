Calculate the mean of both lists.\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of both lists.\n3. Compare the standard deviations, not the actual values.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the comparison.\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully read the question and understand what is being asked.\n - Always double-check your calculations and comparisons.\n - Always consider the context of the problem, including units and interpretations.\n - When comparing statistical measures, focus on the comparison of the measures, not the actual values.\n"
