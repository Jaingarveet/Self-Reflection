I misunderstood the equation that represents the total amount paid so far. I thought the total amount paid so far was $30w$, but it should be $30w + 60$, since the initial payment of $60$ is included in the total amount paid. Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:\n$300 = 30w + 60$\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding of the equation\n- incorrect representation of the total amount paid so far\n\nSolution:\nThe correct equation is:\n$300 = 30w + 60$\nWe can solve for $w$ by subtracting $60$ from both sides:\n$240 = 30w$\nDividing both sides by $30$:\n$8 = w$\nTherefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is 8.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Write the equation for the total cost of the television.\nAnswer: $300$\n2. Represent the weekly payment and initial payment.\nAnswer: $30$ and $60$\n3. Write the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.\nAnswer: $30w + 60$\n4. Solve for the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.\nAnswer: $w = 8$\n5. Check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.\nAnswer: $300 = 30(8) + 60$\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always represent the given information accurately.\n- Always check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.\n- Be careful when working with equations and ensure that all calculations are correct.\n- Take your time and work step-by-step through the problem.\n\nThe correct answer is B."
