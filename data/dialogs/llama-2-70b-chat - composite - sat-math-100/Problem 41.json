Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $x-2$\n  B: $x-3$\n  C: $x-4$\n  D: $x-5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the given information. \nI thought that the values of $f(x)$ in the table were the coefficients of the polynomial, \nbut they are actually the values of $f(x)$ at certain points.\nI also misunderstood the question, thinking it was asking for the factor of $f(x)$ at $x=2$, \nwhen it was actually asking for a factor of $f(x)$ in general.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding of the question\n - Misinterpretation of the given information\n - Lack of attention to detail\n\nSolution:\nThe given table shows some values of $x$ and $f(x)$.\nWe can observe that $f(x)$ is a polynomial function of degree $3$.\nThe factors of a polynomial of degree $3$ are binomials of the form $(x-a)$, where $a$ is a constant.\nWe can compare the given choices with the values in the table to find the factor of $f(x)$.\n\nThe correct answer is $C$, [REDACTED], because $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=4$.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and understand what is being asked.\n2. Analyze the given information and identify the relevant details.\n3. Use the information to determine the factor of $f(x)$.\n4. Compare the given choices with the values in the table to find the correct answer.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n - Pay close attention to the given information and identify the relevant details.\n - Use the information to determine the answer, not just guess from the choices.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that a polynomial of degree $3$ can have at most $3$ factors, and one of them is always $x$.\n"
