The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}\\right)$.\nQuestion: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?\nChoices:\n  A: $-46^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  B: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  C: $-49^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\n  D: $-50^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 would be achieved when $t$ is as small as possible. However, the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows that as $t$ decreases, $a$ also decreases. Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the formula\n* Incorrect reasoning\n\nSolution:\nWe need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.\nWe can start by noticing that the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ implies that as $t$ increases, $a$ also increases.\nTherefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.\nWe can now look at the given choices:\n\n[REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]\n\nThe largest value of $t$ is [REDACTED], so we can choose option [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the formula carefully and understand the relationship between $a$ and $t$.\n2. Identify the correct order of magnitude for $t$ that will result in a value of $a$ closest to 1,000.\n3. Look at the given choices and select the option that corresponds to the correct value of $t$.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always pay attention to the units of measurement.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Don't assume the answer without properly working through the problem.\n* Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're unsure about the concept or formula involved.\n"
