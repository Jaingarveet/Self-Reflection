I incorrectly cancelled out the $[REDACTED]$s in the numerator and denominator, leading me to conclude that $\\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$. The correct solution is to recognize that $\\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$, and therefore, $\\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Cancellation error\n* Misapplication of rules\n* Lack of attention to detail\n\nSolution:\n\n[REDACTED]. Recognize that $\\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$.\n[REDACTED]. Use this relationship to find $\\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n[REDACTED]. Identify the given information in the problem.\n[REDACTED]. Use the given information to find the value of the expression.\n3. Simplify the expression, if possible.\n[REDACTED]. Check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.\n* Use the given information to find the solution, rather than relying on general rules or formulas.\n* Simplify your answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nReflection:\nI will be more careful in my reasoning and pay closer attention to the given information in the problem. I will also make sure to simplify my answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct. In the future, I will double-check my answer to prevent similar errors.\n"
