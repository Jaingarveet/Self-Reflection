The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: How will the quantity of the product supplied to the market change if the price of the product is increased by $\\$ 10$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The quantity supplied will decrease by 5 units.\n  B: The quantity supplied will increase by 5 units.\n  C: The quantity supplied will increase by 10 units.\n  D: The quantity supplied will increase by 50 units.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation. I mistakenly calculated the increase in quantity supplied as 5 units, when in fact, it should have been 10 units.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Arithmetic error\n* Coefficient mistake\n\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the supply function $S(P)$:\n\n$S(P) = \\frac{1}{2} P + 40$\n\nWe can see that the coefficient of $P$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so a $10$ dollar increase in the price ($P + 10$) will result in a $\\frac{10}{2} = 10$ unit increase in the quantity supplied.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Analyze the supply function $S(P)$ and identify the coefficient of $P$.\n2. Calculate the increase in the quantity supplied by multiplying the coefficient of $P$ by the increase in price ($10$).\n3. Choose the answer that matches the calculated increase in quantity supplied.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully analyze the function and identify the relevant coefficients.\n* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always verify your answer by plugging it back into the original equation.\n"
