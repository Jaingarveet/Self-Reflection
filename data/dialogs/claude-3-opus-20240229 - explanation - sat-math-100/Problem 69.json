Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\n  B: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\n  C: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\n  D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning when setting up the equation. I tried to calculate the new number of miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his expenditure by $5, but I set up the equation incorrectly. Instead of equating the cost of the reduced miles to the desired reduction of $5, I equated it to the new total expenditure of $11.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) Currently, Alan drives 100 miles per week. His car gets 25 miles per gallon. \n   So each week he uses 100/25 = 4 gallons of gas.\n2) At $4 per gallon, his current weekly expenditure is 4 * $4 = $16.\n3) He wants to reduce this weekly expenditure by $5. So his new target weekly expenditure is $16 - $5 = $11.\n4) Let m be the number of miles he should drive to achieve this. \n   If he drives m miles, he will use m/25 gallons of gas.\n5) At $4 per gallon, his new weekly expenditure would be (m/25) * $4.\n6) We want this to equal his target of $11. So we can set up the equation:\n   (m/25) * $4 = $11\n7) Simplifying:\n   (4/25) * m = 11\n8) This matches choice D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
