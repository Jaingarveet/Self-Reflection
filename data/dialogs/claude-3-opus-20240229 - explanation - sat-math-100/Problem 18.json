I incorrectly interpreted $9^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ as $(9^3)^{\\frac{1}{4}}$, which is not correct.

This is due to the rules of exponents.\n2) $9^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ is equivalent to the fourth root of 9, which is written as $\\sqrt[4]{9}$.\n3) So, $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (9^{\\frac{1}{4}})^3 = (\\sqrt[4]{9})^3$.\n4) Looking at the choices, $\\sqrt[4]{9}$ is listed as choice B.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: $\\sqrt[4]{9}$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
