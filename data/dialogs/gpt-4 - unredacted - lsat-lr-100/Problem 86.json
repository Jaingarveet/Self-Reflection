        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I made an assumption that was not directly supported by the information provided. The passage does not explicitly state that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than those who flew prior to 1985. It only states that the conditions for the spread of airborne illnesses are more favorable now due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Inference error\n- Reading comprehension error\nSolution:\nThe passage states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished, the higher the level of carbon dioxide. Since the rate of air replenishment has decreased since 1985, it can be inferred that the level of carbon dioxide has increased compared to prior years. Therefore, the correct answer is E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and passage carefully.\n2. Identify the key information provided in the passage.\n3. Avoid making assumptions that are not directly supported by the information in the passage.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the passage.\n5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and passage carefully to understand what is being asked.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not directly supported by the information provided.\n- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided, not based on outside knowledge or assumptions.\n- Practice critical reading skills to improve comprehension and inference abilities.\n"
