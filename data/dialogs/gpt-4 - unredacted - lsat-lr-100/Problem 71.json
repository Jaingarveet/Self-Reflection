        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\nQuestion: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.\n  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.\n  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the curator's statement about the prints available in the museum store. I assumed that all prints sold in the store are of twentieth-century works, but the curator only mentioned that prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the store, not all works on display.\nError Keywords:\n- Comprehension error\n- Assumption error\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe curator states that prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the store. This means that for every work displayed in the museum that is not on loan from a private collector (i.e., part of the museum's permanent collection), there is a print available in the store. Therefore, the correct answer is C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and all statements carefully.\n2. Understand the relationship between the museum's permanent collection, works on loan, and prints sold in the store.\n3. Identify the implications of these relationships.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice based on these implications.\n5. Choose the answer that must be true based on the curator's statements.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and all statements carefully.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not supported by the given information.\n- Understand the logical implications of the given information.\n- Evaluate each answer choice based on these implications, not on assumptions or external knowledge.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills in this area.\n"
