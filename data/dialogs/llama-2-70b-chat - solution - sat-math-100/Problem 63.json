Which of the following equations can be used to find the number of weekly payments, $w$, required to complete the purchase, assuming there are no taxes or fees?\nChoices:\n  A: $300=30 w-60$\n  B: $300=30 w$\n  C: $300=30 w+60$\n  D: $300=60 w-30$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe correct equation is:\n$300 = 30w + 60$\nWe can solve for $w$ by subtracting $60$ from both sides:\n$240 = 30w$\nDividing both sides by $30$:\n$8 = w$\nTherefore, the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is 8.\n"
