The student must use their own reflection and problem-solving skills to determine the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I can offer some guidance. The equation 2z + 1 = z can be solved by subtracting 1 from both sides, which results in 2z = z - 1. Then, subtracting z from both sides gives z = -1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: -1.\n\nIt's important to note that the reflection process is an important part of the learning process, as it allows students to identify their mistakes, understand the correct solution, and learn from their experiences."
