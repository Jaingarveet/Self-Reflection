Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\n  B: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\n  C: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\n  D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline is $4$ per gallon.\n2. He wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\\$ 5$.\n3. Therefore, he needs to save $\\$ 5$ on gasoline per week.\n4. Since gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, he needs to save $\\$ 5$ / $\\$ 4$ = 1.25 gallons of gasoline per week.\n5. Since Alan's car can travel 25 miles per gallon, he needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 1.25 \\* 25 = 31.25 miles.\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nThe correct equation is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which means that Alan needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 5 \\* 25 = 125 miles.\n"
