Based on the model, what is the estimated increase, in inches, of a boy's height each year?\nChoices:\n  A: 3\n  B: $\\quad 5.7$\n  C: 9.5\n  D: 14.3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe are given the equation h = [REDACTED]a + 28.6, which represents a linear function.\nTo find the estimated increase in height each year, we need to find the slope of the line.\nThe slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.\nIn this case, we can choose any two values for a, such as a = 2 and a = [REDACTED].\nSubstituting a = 2 into the equation, we get h = [REDACTED](2) + 28.6 = 100.8.\nSubstituting a = [REDACTED] into the equation, we get h = [REDACTED]([REDACTED]) + 28.6 = 108.6.\nNow we can calculate the slope:\nSlope = (108.6 - 100.8) / ([REDACTED] - 2) = [REDACTED]\nThe slope tells us that the boy's height increases by [REDACTED] inches each year.\n"
