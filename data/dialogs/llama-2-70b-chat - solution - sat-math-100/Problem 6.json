What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\$ 2.60$\n  B: $\\$ 2.85$\n  C: $\\$ 2.95$\n  D: $\\$ 3.35$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe are given two equations:\nb = 2.35 + 0.25x\nc = 1.75 + 0.40x\n\nWe want to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken.\n\nWe can set up an equation:\nb = c\n\nSubstituting b and c with their equations:\n2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x\n\n0.25x = 0.40x\n\nx = 4\n\nNow, we can find the price per pound of beef when x = 4:\nb = 2.35 + 0.25(4)\nb = 2.35 + 1.00\nb = 3.35\n\nTherefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\\$3.35$.\n"
