A temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\\frac{5}{9}$ degree Celsius.\n\nThis means that choice A is correct.\n\nHowever, we can also see that:\n\nII. A temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThis means that choice B is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD: I and II only\n\nI hope this answer is correct.
