Comparing this expression with the given choices, we see that choice C, $2x^3 - 3x$, is equivalent to our expression. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous attempt, I incorrectly answered the question. I realized that I made a mistake in distributing the $2x$ factor. I carefully re-read the question and made sure to distribute the factor correctly. This time, I was able to identify the correct answer, which is choice C."
