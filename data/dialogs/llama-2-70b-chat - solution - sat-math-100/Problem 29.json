The weight of an object on a given planet can be found by using the formula $W=m g$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$\nQuestion: An object on Earth has a weight of 150 newtons. On which planet would the same object have an approximate weight of 170 newtons?\nChoices:\n  A: Venus\n  B: Saturn\n  C: Uranus\n  D: Neptune\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe correct solution is as follows:\nThe weight of an object on a planet can be found by using the formula $W=mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\nThe object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth, so we need to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.\nWe can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.\nThe acceleration due to gravity on [REDACTED] is 11.1 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\nUsing the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of the object on [REDACTED]:\n$W=m(11.1)$\n$W=150(11.1)$\n$W=1665$\nThe weight of the object on [REDACTED] is approximately 1665 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons.\nTherefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on [REDACTED].\n"
