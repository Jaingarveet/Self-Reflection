However, I can offer a solution using the information given in the question.\n\nLet's denote the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female as p.\n\nWe know that there are 122 right-handed students, and 9 times as many right-handed male students as left-handed male students. Therefore, the number of right-handed male students is 9L = 9(18) = 162.\n\nThe total number of students in the school is 18 (left-handed students) + 122 (right-handed students) = 140.\n\nWe can now calculate p as follows:\n\np = (122 - 162) / (122 - 162 + RM)\np = -40 / (122 - 162 + RM)\np = -40 / 60\np = -2/3\n\nTherefore, the closest answer to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
