The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $0.88 p$\n  B: $\\frac{p}{0.88}$\n  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$\n  D: $\\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The laptop's discounted price = $p$\n2. The amount Alma paid, including tax = $p$\n3. The tax rate = 8%\n4. The original price of the laptop = $p$ / (1 + 0.08)\n\nNow, we can simplify the options:\n\n[REDACTED]: $0.88p$ = ($1 - 0.20)($1 + 0.08)p = 0.88p\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] = $\\frac{p}{1 - 0.20}$ = $\\frac{p}{0.80}$\n\n[REDACTED]: $(0.8)(1.08)p$ = $0.8p$ + $0.08p$ = $0.88p$\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] = $\\frac{p}{0.80}$ = [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
