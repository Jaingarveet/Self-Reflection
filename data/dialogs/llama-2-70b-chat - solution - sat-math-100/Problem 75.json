The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\$ 90$\n  B: $\\$ 120$\n  C: $\\$ 133$\n  D: $\\$ 155$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWe are given the supply function $S(P) = \\frac{1}{2} P + 40$ and the demand function $D(P) = 220 - P$.\nTo find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we set the two functions equal to each other:\n$S(P) = D(P)$\n$\\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$\n$P = 120$\n"

What did I learn from this mistake?\nI learned that I need to be more careful in my calculations and make sure I'm solving the equation correctly.\n4. How will I prevent this mistake in the future?\nI will double-check my calculations and make sure I'm using the correct formulas and equations.\n5. What is the correct answer and why?\nThe correct answer is B: $\\$ 120$. At this price, the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
