        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze each statement:\nA: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. This statement is true because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, cookies are made on at least two different days. Since there are three kinds of cookies and each kind has three batches, there must be at least one batch made on each of the five days.\nB: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. This statement could be false. For example, if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, then only one batch of cookies would be made on Wednesday.\nC: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This statement could be false. For example, if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, then two batches of cookies would be made on Monday.\nD: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This statement could be false. For example, if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, then three batches of cookies would be made on Tuesday.\nE: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. This statement could be false. For example, if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, then no batches of cookies would be made on Friday.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
