Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\n\nThought:\n- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.\n- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nLet's analyze the choices:\nA: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nB: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nC: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nD: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it. \nE: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does. This MUST be true. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two students review the same plays, O'Neill must review at least one more play than Kramer.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

However, the information only establishes relative comparisons between the students' reviews.\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete information\n- Relative comparison\n- Assumption\nSolution:\n1. Identify the relative comparisons provided:\n    - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n    - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n    - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n    - Exactly two students review the same plays.\n2.
