The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  B: Jaramillo and Ong\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Ong\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nNow, let's consider each option:\nA: Jaramillo and Novetzke: This violates constraint 1, as both Kayne and Novetzke cannot be unassigned.\nB: Jaramillo and Ong: This violates constraint 2, as if Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.\nC: Kayne and Landon: This satisfies all constraints. Kayne and Landon can be unassigned, and the remaining three candidates (Jaramillo, Novetzke, and Ong) can be assigned to the three ambassadorships without violating any constraints.\nD: Kayne and Novetzke: This violates constraint 1, as both Kayne and Novetzke cannot be unassigned.\nE: Landon and Ong: This violates constraint 4, as Landon must be assigned to Zambia if assigned at all.\nTherefore, the only pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be Kayne and Landon.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
