Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?\nChoices:\n  A: a 1-day website target\n  B: a 2-day voicemail target\n  C: a 2-day website target\n  D: a 3-day voicemail target\n  E: a 3-day website target\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n* None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n* Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n* Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nBased on these conditions, let's examine each choice:\nA: a 1-day website target: This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 1 day or less.\nB: a 2-day voicemail target: This could be set for multiple clients as long as their website target is also 2 days or less.\nC: a 2-day website target: This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 2 days or less.\nD: a 3-day voicemail target: This could only be set for one client (Image) as it needs to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\nE: a 3-day website target: This could be set for multiple clients as long as their voicemail target is also 3 days or less.\nTherefore, the target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

I focused on the voicemail targets and overlooked the website targets.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of conditions\n - Overlooking information\n - Focusing on a subset of information\nSolution:\n1. Identify the conditions that must be met.\n2. Analyze each choice in light of the conditions.\n3. Consider all aspects of the problem, including website and voicemail targets.\n4. Eliminate choices that violate the conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that is consistent with all conditions.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and conditions carefully.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n3. Consider all aspects of the problem, not just a subset.\n4. Eliminate choices that are clearly incorrect.\n5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.\n6. Double-check your reasoning and answer.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to all details and conditions.\n - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that do not fit.\n - Be systematic and methodical in your approach.\n - Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the correct answer must satisfy all conditions, not just some of them."
