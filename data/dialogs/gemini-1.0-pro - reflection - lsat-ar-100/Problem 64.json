Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

However, the prompt states that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This information was crucial for determining the most likely scenario.\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete information processing\n- Ignoring key details\n- Assuming equal probability for all scenarios\nSolution:\nMahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.\nParra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\nStuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\nThere are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nIf Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 2, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 3.

Identify all the given conditions and constraints.\n2. Pay close attention to details and numerical information.\n3. Consider all possible scenarios, but prioritize scenarios that align with additional constraints.\n4. If applicable, calculate probabilities for each scenario based on the given information.\n5. Choose the answer that aligns with the most likely scenario.\nAdvice:\n- Be mindful of all the information provided in the prompt, including numerical details and subtle hints.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n- When multiple scenarios are possible, consider their relative likelihood based on the given information.\n- If quantitative information is available, use calculations to determine probabilities and support your reasoning.\n- Choose the answer that aligns with the most likely scenario, considering all the constraints and information provided."
