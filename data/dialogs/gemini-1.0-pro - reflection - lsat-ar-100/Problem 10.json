Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial analysis was correct in identifying the requirements and analyzing each option. However, I made a mistake in evaluating option C. I incorrectly concluded that it violated the requirement of selecting at least three novels. In reality, option C satisfies all the requirements:\n* **Number of works:** 2 French novels + 2 Russian novels + 2 French plays = 6 works (within the limit of 5-6 works).\n* **French works:** 2 French novels + 2 French plays = 4 works (within the limit of 4 French works).\n* **Novels:** 2 French novels + 2 Russian novels = 4 novels (within the 3-4 novels range).\n* **French vs. Russian novels:** 2 French novels >= 2 Russian novels (satisfies the requirement).\n* **French plays and Russian play:** Since only 2 French plays are selected, the Russian play can be included without violating any requirement.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the requirement for novels, focusing only on the minimum (3) and overlooking the maximum (4).\n* **Inattentive reading:** I failed to carefully consider all aspects of option C, leading to a hasty conclusion.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the requirements:** Carefully read and understand all the requirements regarding the number of works, types of works, and limitations.\n2. **Analyze each option:** Systematically evaluate each option against each requirement, ensuring all aspects are considered.\n3. **Double-check calculations:** If calculations are involved, double-check them for accuracy to avoid misinterpretations.\n4. **Consider all possibilities:** Ensure all possible combinations within the given constraints are explored before reaching a conclusion.\n## Instructions:\n1. Read the question and context thoroughly.\n2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n3. Identify the key requirements and limitations.\n4. Analyze each option systematically against each requirement.\n5. Double-check calculations and interpretations.\n6. Consider all possible scenarios before making a final decision.\n## General Advice:\n* **Read carefully and understand the problem completely.**\n* **Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.**\n* **Identify key requirements and limitations.**\n* **Analyze each option systematically and thoroughly.**\n* **Double-check calculations and interpretations.**\n* **Consider all possible scenarios before making a final decision.**\n* **Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions that might influence your analysis.**\n* **Seek clarification if anything is unclear or ambiguous.**\nBy following these steps and advice, I can improve my accuracy and avoid similar mistakes in the future. \n"
