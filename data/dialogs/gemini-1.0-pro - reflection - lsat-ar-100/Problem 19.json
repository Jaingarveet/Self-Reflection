        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nThought: \nSince Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give reports on the same day.\nSince George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a morning report.\nTherefore, George must give an afternoon report on Tuesday.\nSince Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, one of them must give a morning report on Tuesday.\nIf Olivia gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Robert must give the afternoon report on Monday.\nIf Robert gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Olivia must give the afternoon report on Monday.\nIn either case, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.\nTherefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.\nTherefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday.\nSo the answer is B.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
