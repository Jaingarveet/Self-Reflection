Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial reasoning was correct in identifying the key conditions and constraints regarding the sales representatives and their zones. However, I made a crucial error in assuming that Zone 3 must have at least 3 representatives based solely on the information that it has more representatives than Zone 2. This assumption overlooked the possibility that Zone 1 could also have more representatives than Zone 2, potentially leaving Zone 3 with only 2 representatives.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Overgeneralization:** Assuming a rule applies universally without considering all possibilities.\n* **Incomplete analysis:** Failing to consider all relevant factors and constraints.\n* **Logical fallacy:** Drawing an unwarranted conclusion based on incomplete information.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the key conditions:**\n    * Parra and Quinn work together.\n    * Stuckey and Udall work together.\n    * Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.\n2. **Analyze all possibilities:**\n    * **Zone 1:** 3 representatives (Parra, Quinn, and one other).\n    * **Zone 2:** 2 representatives (Tiao and Udall).\n    * **Zone 3:** 2 representatives (Kim and Mahr).\n3. **Verify the conditions:**\n    * Parra and Quinn are together in Zone 1.\n    * Stuckey and Udall are together in Zone 2.\n    * Zone 3 has 2 representatives, which is more than Zone 2's 2 representatives.\n4. **Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions:** Option A: Kim and Mahr.\n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1. **Read the question carefully and identify all relevant information.**\n2. **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n3. **Consider all possible scenarios and constraints, not just the most obvious ones.**\n4. **Test your conclusions against all available information to ensure they are logically sound.**\n5. **Double-check your work before selecting an answer.**\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* **Be mindful of logical fallacies and overgeneralizations.**\n* **Pay close attention to wording and subtle details in the problem statement.**\n* **Use a systematic approach to analyze all possibilities and eliminate incorrect options.**\n* **Don't rush to conclusions; take your time to think through the problem thoroughly.**\n* **If unsure, double-check your reasoning and calculations before making a final decision.** \n"
