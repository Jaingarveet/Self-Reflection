Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be\nChoices:\n  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant\n  B: the pharmacy and the toy store\n  C: the two restaurants\n  D: a restaurant and the toy store\n  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian\n\nThought:\nThe optometrist and the shoe store are next to each other.\nThe pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Pharmacy must be at one end (let's say the left end).\n2. Optometrist and shoe store are together.\n3. Restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.\n4. Toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n5. Place the veterinarian next to the pharmacy (left end).\n6. Place the toy store next to the veterinarian.\n7. Place a restaurant next to the toy store.\n8. Place the other restaurant at the other end (right end).\nInstructions:\n1. Read and understand all constraints.\n2. Start with the most constrained element (pharmacy) and place it first.\n3. Place elements with the most restrictions next.\n4. Consider the separation requirements between elements.\n5. Work step-by-step, placing elements and checking constraints.\n6. Double-check placement against all constraints before finalizing.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to all constraints and their implications.\n- Start with the most constrained elements and work outwards.\n- Visualize the placement of elements to avoid logical errors.\n- Double-check your work against all constraints before finalizing.\n- Consider using diagrams or tables to visualize the arrangement."
