        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully, noting all directly stated facts.\n2. Identify the key pieces of information, ignoring tangential points.\n3. Analyze each answer choice in light of the key information.\n4. Determine which choice is most directly supported by the facts as stated.\n5. Re-read the passage to confirm your selected answer is fully supported.\n6. If multiple choices seem supported, determine which has the strongest and most direct support.\n7. Do not infer beyond what is directly implied by the stated information.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\nThe key facts stated in the passage are:\n1) Cat allergies are caused by proteins in cats' skin secretions and saliva\n2) The specific proteins people are allergic to varies from person to person \n3) All cats shed skin and spread saliva in their environment\n4) There are no cats that cannot cause allergies\n5) A specific cat may cause allergies in some people allergic to cats, but not all\nLooking at each answer choice:\nA) This is not supported. The passage indicates allergies depend on the proteins and the person, not cat breeds.\nB) This is strongly supported. Since people are allergic to different proteins, no single cat will have all the proteins to trigger allergies in every allergic person.\nC) While possibly true, this is not directly stated or implied. The passage focuses on differences between people, not differences between cats.\nD) The passage does not compare the intensity of allergic reactions between individuals. \nE) This goes beyond what is implied. The proteins a cat has and a person is allergic to would allow some level of prediction.\nTherefore, after careful analysis, the answer most strongly supported by the information in the passage is B - No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
