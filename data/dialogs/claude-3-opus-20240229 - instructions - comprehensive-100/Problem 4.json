        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Given information:\n   - The space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed\n   - It takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point\n2. Calculate the speed of the shuttle:\n   Speed = Distance / Time\n         = 700m / 40s\n         = 17.5 m/s\n3. Calculate the distance traveled by the shuttle in the time it takes to pass a point:\n   Distance = Speed × Time \n            = 17.5 m/s × 5s\n            = 87.5 m\n4. The distance traveled while passing a point is equal to the length of the shuttle.\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters.\n5. No unit conversion is necessary as the answer choices are in meters.\n6. The closest answer choice to 87.5 meters is 75 meters.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
