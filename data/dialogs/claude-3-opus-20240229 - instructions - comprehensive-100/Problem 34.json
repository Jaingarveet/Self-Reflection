Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.\n2. Look for the gap between the evidence presented and the conclusion.\n3. Consider what must be assumed to bridge that gap and make the conclusion follow logically.\n4. Examine each answer choice to see if it fulfills the necessary assumption.\n5. Select the choice that best represents the missing piece needed for the argument to hold.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The conclusion is that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\n2. The evidence is:\n   - Most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. \n   - There's a gap in explaining why a longer commute will result from the move.\n3. To bridge that gap, we need to assume that employees currently have a shorter commute. Otherwise, the move wouldn't change their commute time.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   A) This isn't necessary. Even if some can't afford housing near Milltown, the argument still holds.\n   B) The chairperson's reasons are irrelevant to the employees' commute time. \n   C) Employee opinions on the move are not related to the commute claim.\n   D) This directly fills the gap. If commutes are currently under 30 mins, then the move to an unaffordable area will lengthen them.\n   E) Pay raises are a separate issue from housing affordability and commute time.\n5. Choice D is the only one that provides the missing link - that current commutes are shorter. This is necessary to conclude they will increase.\nTherefore, the argument requires assuming choice D - that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
