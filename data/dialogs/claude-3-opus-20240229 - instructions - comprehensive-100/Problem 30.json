At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and given information.\n2. Identify the specific conditions and constraints.\n3. Consider all possibilities that satisfy the conditions, not just the first one that comes to mind.\n4. Systematically evaluate each answer choice against the conditions.\n5. Eliminate choices that violate any of the conditions.\n6. If multiple choices seem possible, look for additional information to differentiate them.\n7.

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. There are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. \n2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf.\n3. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n4. I is on the middle shelf.\n5. K is on a higher shelf than F. \n6. O is on a higher shelf than L.\n7. F and M are on the same shelf.\n8. The question states G is on the top shelf.\nWith G on the top shelf, and at least 2 books per shelf, that leaves 1-2 more books that could be on the top shelf.\nI must be on the middle shelf. F and M are together, and K is above F, so F and M must be on the bottom, and K on the middle or top. \nO is above L, so L must be on the bottom or middle. But we know there are more books on the bottom than top. So L is likely on the bottom, O on the middle or top.\nLooking at the choices:\nA: H, I - Possible. I is confirmed middle. H could be middle with the info given.\nB: I, L - Not possible. L can't be middle as it's below O.\nC: H, I, L - Not possible. L can't be middle as it's below O. \nD: I, K, L - Not possible. L can't be middle as it's below O.\nE: F, I, M - Not possible. F and M must be on the bottom together.\nTherefore, the only possible choice is A: H, I\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
