F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is assigned to the sales department\n  B: H is assigned to the production department.\n  C: I was assigned to the sales department.\n  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the first condition that H and Y must be allocated in the same department. I focused on the condition that if X is in the same department as F, then W must be in the production department, and concluded that W cannot be in the public relations department. However, I failed to consider that if X and F are in the production department, and W is also in the production department, then there is no room for H in the production department, given that H and Y must be together.\n"
