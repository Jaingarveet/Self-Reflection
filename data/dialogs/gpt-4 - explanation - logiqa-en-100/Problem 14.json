Given that the Administration Department is above the Planning Department but below the Human Resources Department, the Administration Department cannot be above the Human Resources Department. Therefore, the Administration Department and the Human Resources Department must be on the same floor. This means the Sales Department, which cannot be adjacent to the Human Resources Department, cannot be one level above the Administration Department. Therefore, the only possible correct answer is A: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
