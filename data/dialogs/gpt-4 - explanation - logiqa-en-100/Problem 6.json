City E, City F, Lake G, Mountain H, Mountain I, Lake J Taking into account factors such as time, funding, plateau environment, and physical condition of the personnel, (1) at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.(2) If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.(3) If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.(4) Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.\nQuestion: If this team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The group went to E city and J lake\n  B: The group went to city E instead of city F\n  C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain\n  D: The group went to F city and G lake tour\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I correctly understood that the team cannot go to Lake J and must therefore go to Lake G. However, I failed to apply the second condition correctly, which states that if the team doesn't go to either City E or City F, they can't go to Lake G. Since they must go to Lake G, they must also visit either City E or City F. However, since they can't go to Mountain H without going to City E (according to condition 3), and they can't go to City E (since they can't go to Mountain H), they must go to City F.\n"
