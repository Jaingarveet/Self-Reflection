Zhang Wei's semester papers must be excellent, otherwise a class report will be required.\n  D: Relying on unconfirmed assumptions? If Zhang Wei's semester papers are not excellent, she will fail the exam without giving a lecture.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe reasoning in the argument is flawed because it makes an assumption that is not necessarily true. The argument assumes that all of Zhang Wei's extracurricular assignments are excellent, but this is not stated in the argument. Additionally, the argument ignores the possibility that Zhang Wei's semester papers may not be excellent, even if she did not have to give a class report. This means that the argument relies on unconfirmed assumptions, which makes it flawed.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Relying on unconfirmed assumptions. This option accurately describes the flaw in the argument.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning in the argument:\n\n1. The argument states that Zhang Wei's extracurricular assignments are excellent.\n2. The argument assumes that all of Zhang Wei's extracurricular assignments are excellent, which is not necessarily true.\n3. The argument ignores the possibility that Zhang Wei's semester papers may not be excellent, even if she did not have to give a class report.\n4. The argument concludes that Zhang Wei must have excellent semester papers in order to pass the exam, which is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because it relies on unconfirmed assumptions and ignores other possible scenarios.\n"
