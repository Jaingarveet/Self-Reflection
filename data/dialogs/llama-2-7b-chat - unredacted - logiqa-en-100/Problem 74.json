However, upon further reflection, I realize that if He Zhilian is not selected, then Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected at the same time as Guo Yanran. Therefore, the correct answer is option D, Song Wenkai.\n\nReflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by not considering the constraints of the problem. I should have realized that if He Zhilian is not selected, then Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected at the same time as Guo Yanran. Thank you for pointing out the error, and I will make sure to be more careful in my future responses."
