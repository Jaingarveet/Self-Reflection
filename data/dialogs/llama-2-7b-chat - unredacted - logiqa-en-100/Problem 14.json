Here's how I would answer the question again:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the information provided in the question, we know that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent, and the sales department is not located on the second floor. Therefore, the sales department must be located on a floor above the planning department.\n\nThe planning department is located one floor below the human resources department, so the sales department could be located on the next floor above the planning department. This means that the sales department is located on the third floor.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department."
