However, the fact that the online forum is a legal forum weakens this argument because it suggests that the increase in these types of posts could be due to the increased number of people using the internet and participating in online discussions, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.\n\nOption (B) The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, is also relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the increase in posts could be due to the increased number of people using the internet and participating in online discussions, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.\n\nOption (A) \"Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles.\" Throughout the ages, is a general statement that does not directly address the argument being made in the passage.\n\nOption (C) In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes, is also relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the increase in posts could be due to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The online forum is a legal forum.\n"

I selected option (B) The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, as the correct answer. However, upon closer examination, I realize that this option does not directly address the argument being made in the passage. The passage is focused on the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people, and the fact that the online forum is a legal forum weakens the argument that this increase is evidence of a deteriorating social atmosphere.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) The online forum is a legal forum. This option addresses the argument being made in the passage and provides a counterargument that the increase in posts could be due to the increased number of people using the internet and participating in online discussions, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, my previous answer was incorrect, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the problem and improve my response. Thank you for the feedback."
