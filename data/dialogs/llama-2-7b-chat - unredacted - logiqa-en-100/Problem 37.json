        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (B) Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment.\n\nThe statement \"Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment\" is strongly supported by the given information. The passage highlights that the development prospect of Huaizhou City is not optimistic, and its development depends on industry, which inevitably produces pollution. This means that the city will face challenges in both economic growth and natural living environment.\n\nChoices (A) and (C) are not supported by the passage. Choice (A) suggests that the quality of life in Huaizhou depends only on its economic growth and natural living environment, which is not the case, as the passage highlights that the city's development prospect is not optimistic. Choice (C) states that the economic environment of Huaizhou has deteriorated in recent years, which is not explicitly mentioned in the passage.\n\nFinally, choice (D) is incorrect because the pollution of air, water, and buildings in Huaizhou City is not specifically attributed to chemical companies. While industry does produce pollution, it is not specified that chemical companies are the primary cause of pollution in the city.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment."
