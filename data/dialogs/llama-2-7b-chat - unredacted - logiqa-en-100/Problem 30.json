The conditions are:\n\n1. At least one person of Bingding is selected: Since Bingding is one of the candidates, this condition is satisfied.\n2. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected: Since E is not selected, this condition is not satisfied.\n3. A maximum of 2 people are selected: Since three people (A, B, and C) are selected, this condition is not satisfied.\n\nNow, based on these conditions, we need to determine who is not in the fourth position.\n\nOption A states that the person in the fourth position is A. However, since A is selected, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B states that the person in the fourth position is B. However, since B is not selected, this option is also incorrect.\n\nOption C states that the person in the fourth position is C. However, since three people (A, B, and C) are selected, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D states that the person in the fourth position is Ding. Since Ding is not a candidate, this option is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the person who is not in the fourth position is Ding.\n\nAdvice:\n\n1. Read the conditions carefully: Make sure you understand the conditions given in the problem and apply them correctly.\n2. Use logical reasoning: Use logical reasoning to determine the correct answer based on the given conditions.\n3. Check your work: Double-check your answer by applying the conditions to the selected candidates.\n4. Pay attention to the given information: Make sure you pay attention to the information given in the problem, including the names of the candidates and the conditions for selection.\n"
