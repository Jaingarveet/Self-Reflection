Therefore, the correct answer is (B) \"Doximayo\" means \"student\".\n\nExplanation for why (A) \"Doximayo\" means \"hostage\" is incorrect:\n\nThe information provided states that \"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey\" means \"kidnapping student (host) hostage\". This implies that \"Doximayo\" refers to a student, not a hostage.\n\nExplanation for why (C) \"Mugbudengs\" means \"kidnapping\" is incorrect:\n\nThe information provided states that \"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs\" means \"hostage holding (see) 'Reporter'\". This implies that \"Mugbudengs\" refers to the act of holding a hostage, not the act of kidnapping.\n\nExplanation for why (D) \"I don't know what they mean\" is incorrect:\n\nThe information provided states that the intelligence department intercepted the three pieces of cryptographic information sent by the terrorists, and that the cryptographers were able to decipher the meanings of the relevant words. Therefore, it is unlikely that the correct answer is (D) \"I don't know what they mean\".\n"
