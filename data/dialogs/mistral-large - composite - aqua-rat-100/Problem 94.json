Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n2. Identify the number of positions for letters and numbers in the bike number format.\n3. Calculate the number of possible combinations for each position.\n4. Determine the number of distinct letters needed to form all possible combinations.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to answer the question that is being asked, not the question you think is being asked.\n"
