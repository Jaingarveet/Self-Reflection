Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can use combinations to count the number of pairs that can be formed.\n\nLet's start with 3 letters (A, B, C). We can use these to code for 3 types of books as single letters. To form pairs, we have 3 choose 2 = 3 combinations (AB, AC, BC). So with 3 letters, we can code for 6 types of books.\n\nNext, let's try 4 letters (A, B, C, D). We can use these to code for 4 types of books as single letters. To form pairs, we have 4 choose 2 = 6 combinations (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD). So with 4 letters, we can code for 10 types of books.\n\nSince Amy has 10 types of books, the smallest number of letters she will need is 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
