How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices:\n  A: 10,8\n  B: 9,8\n  C: 7,8\n  D: 5,6\n  E: 11,12\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the cost of the brown sharpeners.\nThe gap in my knowledge was in understanding the problem statement.\nI assumed that the cost of brown sharpeners was 1 rupee, but the problem states that Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misunderstanding of problem statement\n - Misinterpretation of cost difference\n\nSolution:\nLet's assume the number of white sharpeners is x and the number of brown sharpeners is y.\nWe know that x + y = 18 (total number of sharpeners) and x + (x - y) = 100 (total cost of sharpeners).\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 10 and y = 8.\n\nInstructions:\n1.
