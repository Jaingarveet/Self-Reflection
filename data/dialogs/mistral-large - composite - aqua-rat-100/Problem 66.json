If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my calculation when solving the quadratic equation.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the concept of arithmetic progression but in solving the quadratic equation.\nI knew the correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression but made a calculation error.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Quadratic equation error\n - Factoring error\nSolution:\nThe ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression ([REDACTED].P.) with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).\nThe youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the [REDACTED].P. is 7.\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is [REDACTED]0 years.\nTo find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:\nSum = n * (2a + (n - 1) * d) / 2\nwhere Sum is the sum of the ages ([REDACTED]0), a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (1/4), and n is the number of terms (members).\nWe can rearrange the formula to solve for n:\nn = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)\nSubstituting the given values:\nn = ([REDACTED]0 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)\nWe can simplify and solve for n:\nn = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)\nn = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)\nn = 500 / (13 + n/4)\n4n = [REDACTED]00 / (13 + n/4)\n4n(13 + n/4) = [REDACTED]00\n52n + n^2 = [REDACTED]00\nn^2 + 52n - [REDACTED]00 = 0\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n(n - [REDACTED])(n + 80) = 0\nThe possible values for n are [REDACTED] and -80.

Identify the ages of the members as an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).\n2. Identify the youngest member as 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the [REDACTED].P. is 7.\n3. Identify the sum of the ages of all the members as [REDACTED]0 years.\n4. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression to solve for the number of members (n).\n5. Rearrange the formula to solve for n.\n6. Substitute the given values into the formula.\n7. Simplify and solve for n.\n8. Factor the quadratic equation to find the possible values for n.\n9. Choose the positive value for n as the number of members.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to factor the quadratic equation correctly to find the possible values for n.\n - Always choose the positive value for n as the number of members.\n"
