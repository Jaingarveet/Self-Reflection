What could be the least possible no of students in the school?\nChoices:\n  A: 550\n  B: 570\n  C: 600\n  D: 700\n  E: none of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my understanding of the problem and the concept of least common multiple (LCM).\nThe gap in my knowledge was in understanding that the LCM is not applicable in this problem.\nI incorrectly assumed that the LCM of the percentages would give me the least possible number of students.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Conceptual error\n - Misunderstanding of the problem\n - Incorrect application of LCM\n\nSolution:\nTo find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both percentages.\n20% of the students took physics, so the number of students must be a multiple of 5 (since 20% is equivalent to 1/5).\n28% of the students took math, so the number of students must be a multiple of 7 (since 28% is equivalent to 2/7).\nThe smallest number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 is 35.\nHowever, the question states that there are more than 501 students in the school.\nTherefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 525 (which is a multiple of both 5 and 7 and greater than 501).\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the percentages given in the problem.\n2. Convert the percentages to fractions.\n3. Determine the smallest number that satisfies both fractions (i.e., is a multiple of both denominators).\n4. Check if the number obtained in step 3 is greater than the minimum number of students given in the problem.\n5. If the number obtained in step 3 is not greater than the minimum number of students, find the next multiple of both denominators that is greater than the minimum number of students.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the LCM is not always applicable in problems involving percentages.\n - Always consider the constraints given in the problem (e.g., minimum number of students).\n"
