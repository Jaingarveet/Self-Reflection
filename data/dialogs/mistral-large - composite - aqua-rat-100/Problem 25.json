        "content": "Reflection:\nI previously made an error in my calculation of the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nExplanation:\nLet's denote the height of the tower as h, the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower as d1, and the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° as d2.\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can write the following equations:\ntan(45°) = h/d1\ntan(60°) = h/d2\n\nSince tan(45°) = 1 and tan(60°) = √3, we have:\nh = d1\nh = d2 * √3\n\nNow, let's denote the speed of the car as v. We know that the time it takes for the car to travel from d1 to d2 is 10 minutes. Therefore:\nd1 - d2 = v * 10\n\nSubstituting h = d1 and h = d2 * √3 into the equation above, we get:\nd1 - d2 = (d1 - d2 * √3) * v * 10\n\nSolving for d2, we find that d2 = d1 / (1 + √3).\n\nNow, let's denote the time it takes for the car to travel from d2 to the base of the tower as t. We have:\nd2 = v * t\n\nSubstituting d2 = d1 / (1 + √3) into the equation above, we get:\nd1 / (1 + √3) = v * t\n\nSolving for t, we find that t = d1 / (v * (1 + √3)).\n\nSince we want to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes to 60°, we need to find t - 10.\n\nSubstituting t = d1 / (v * (1 + √3)) into the equation above, we get:\nt - 10 = d1 / (v * (1 + √3)) - 10\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nt - 10 = d1 / v - 10 * (1 + √3) / (1 + √3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by v, we get:\nv * (t - 10) = d1 - 10 * v * (1 + √3)\n\nSubstituting d1 = h and v = h / (t - 10), we get:\nh / (t - 10) * (t - 10) = h - 10 * h / (t - 10) * (1 + √3)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nt - 10 = 10 * (√3 - 1)\n\nSolving for t, we find that t = 10 * √3.\n\nTherefore, the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower after the angle of elevation changes to 60° is 10 * √3 - 10 = 10 * (√3 - 1) minutes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
