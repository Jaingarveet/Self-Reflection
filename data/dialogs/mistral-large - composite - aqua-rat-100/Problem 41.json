As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was\nChoices:\n  A: 8\n  B: 12\n  C: 16\n  D: 24\n  E: 25\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an algebraic error in my equation setup.\nThe gap in my knowledge was in algebra, specifically in setting up the correct equation to represent the problem.\nI incorrectly set up the equation as 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4, when it should have been 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4(x-4)/x.\nError Keywords:\n - Algebraic error\n - Equation setup error\n - Incorrect equation\nSolution:\nLet x be the number of people who attended the picnic.\nThe original cost per person was 96/x.\nThe new cost per person was 96/(x-4).\nThe difference in cost per person was 4.\nThe equation to represent this is 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4(x-4)/x.\nSolving this equation for x gives x = [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the total cost of the picnic.\n2. Identify the extra cost per person.\n3. Let x be the number of people who attended the picnic.\n4. Set up an equation to represent the original cost per person.\n5. Set up an equation to represent the new cost per person.\n6. Set up an equation to represent the difference in cost per person.\n7. Solve the equation for x.\n[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to set up the correct equation to represent the problem.\n - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and simplifications.\n - Always check your answer against the given choices.\n"
