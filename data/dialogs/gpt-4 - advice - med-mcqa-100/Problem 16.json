In case of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery, the anastomosis (connection) between certain arteries can help maintain the blood supply to the upper limb. The correct anastomotic connection in this case would be between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery. These arteries are branches of the subclavian and axillary arteries respectively, and their anastomosis can bypass the obstruction and ensure blood flow to the upper limb.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
