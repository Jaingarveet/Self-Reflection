        "content": "Topic: English\nContext: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so \"gentle and easy to be entreated,\" as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the \"physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature.\" To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.\nQuestion: nothingness\") Which choice best states the relationship between the two passages?\nChoices:\n  A: Passage 2 illustrates the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1.\n  B: Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.\n  C: Passage 2 provides a historical context for the perspective offered in Passage 1.\n  D: Passage 2 elaborates upon several ideas implied in Passage 1.\n\n  Based on the content of the two passages, the best choice is (B) Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.\n\nIn Passage 1, Grimké argues that women should conform to their \"subordinate station\" in society and exercise their influence peacefully and through moral suasion. In contrast, Passage 2 argues that the idea of a subordinate station for women is based on a flawed understanding of human rights and that women have the same moral nature as men, making them equally entitled to the same rights and responsibilities.\n\nPassage 2 directly challenges the central argument of Passage 1 by claiming that the idea of a subordinate station for women is not supported by a moral analysis of human rights. Therefore, choice (B) is the best answer.\n\nChoices (A) and (C) are not accurate representations of the relationship between the two passages. Choice (A) implies that Passage 2 illustrates the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1, but there is no indication in Passage 2 of any practical difficulties or challenges related to Grimké's proposal. Choice (C) suggests that Passage 2 provides a historical context for the perspective offered in Passage 1, but there is no historical context provided in Passage 2 that relates to the argument made in Passage 1. Choice (D) is also not accurate, as Passage 2 does not elaborate upon any ideas implied in Passage 1.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
