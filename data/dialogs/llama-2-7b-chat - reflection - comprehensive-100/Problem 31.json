Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.\n  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.\n  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.\n  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.\n  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.\n\nExplanation:\nThe medical researcher's argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries is based on the finding that both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. However, if most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps, then the effect of stretching on injury prevention may be limited. In this case, the fact that both groups of joggers incurred similar numbers of injuries may not necessarily indicate that stretching before jogging does not help prevent injuries, as the injuries may have been caused by factors unrelated to flexibility.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
