Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Therefore, the most logically completing the argument is that students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject.

The argument suggests that just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting, a proper foundation is essential for successful learning.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience. This choice aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting.\n\nThe other choices do not logically complete the argument:\n\n* (A) is unrelated to the argument, as it suggests that educators should be undemanding, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.\n* (C) is also unrelated, as it suggests that educators should revise their teaching methods, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.\n* (D) is partially related, but it does not complete the argument, as it suggests that teaching new students is more difficult than teaching advanced students, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.\n* (E) is the most logically completing the argument, as it suggests that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends on their initial educational experience, which aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting."
