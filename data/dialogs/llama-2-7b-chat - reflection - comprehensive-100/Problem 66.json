Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

You correctly identified the correct answer as (A): $P = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1} m$.\n\nHere's why:\n\nYou correctly recognized that the formula is a proportion, and you simplified it by multiplying both sides by $\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}$. This resulted in isolating $P$ on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nWell done!\n\nNow, let's review the process you used to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1. You read the question carefully and identified the key elements of the problem, including the formula and the given values.\n2. You broke down the formula into simpler parts and analyzed each part separately.\n3. You used algebraic manipulation to simplify the formula and isolate $P$.\n4. You checked your work by plugging in the values given in the question and verifying that the result matched the correct answer.\n\nGreat job! Keep practicing, and you'll become even better at solving math problems."
