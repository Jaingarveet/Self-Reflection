Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

But clearly this conclusion is false. After all, the argument Arnot makes for this claim depends on the dubious assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses a flaw in the argument's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it\n  B: it treats a change that is required for virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills as a change that will guarantee the virtual elimination of those ills\n  C: it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true\n  D: it distorts the opponent's argument and then attacks this distorted argument\n  E: it uses the key term \"government\" in one sense in a premise and in another sense in the conclusion\n\n  The correct answer is (C): it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true.\n\nThe argument made by Arnot's editorial assumes that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public, which is a dubious assumption. However, the flaw in the argument is not that it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it (option A), or that it treats a change as a guarantee for the virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills (option B). Rather, the flaw is that the argument fails to consider that some of the assumptions used to justify the conclusion may be true, even if the conclusion itself is false (option C).\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C): it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
