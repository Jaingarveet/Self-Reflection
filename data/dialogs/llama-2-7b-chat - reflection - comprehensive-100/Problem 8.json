How long after they begin will they meet?\nChoices:\n  A:  1\n  B:  1.25\n  C:  1.50\n  D:  1.75\n  E:  2\n\n  Great, let's solve this problem!\n\nWe know that the two cars start at opposite ends of a 50-mile highway, and they are traveling at different speeds. The car traveling at 12 mph will cover 12 miles in 1 hour, since the speed is constant. The car traveling at 13 mph will cover 13 miles in 1 hour, since the speed is also constant.\n\nTo find the time it takes for the cars to meet, we can use the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nFor the car traveling at 12 mph, the time it takes to cover 50 miles is:\n\nTime = 50 miles / 12 mph = 4.17 hours (Answer: B)\n\nFor the car traveling at 13 mph, the time it takes to cover 50 miles is:\n\nTime = 50 miles / 13 mph = 3.85 hours (Answer: C)\n\nSo, the cars will meet after 4.17 hours (Answer: B) and 3.85 hours (Answer: C).\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
