I misunderstood the equation and calculated the time incorrectly.\n\nAction:\nTo solve this problem, I will use the equation again and apply the correct calculations.\n\n$$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$$\n\nSubstituting t = 4.0 (the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground), we get:\n\n$$h=-4.9 \\times 4^{2}+25 \\times 4=24.1+100=124.1$$\n\nTherefore, the ball will hit the ground after approximately 124.1 seconds.\n\nAnswer: B: 4.0 seconds."
