I crossed-multiplied the equation incorrectly, which led to an incorrect calculation.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Cross-multiplication error\n* Simplification error\n* Division error\n\nSolution:\nWe are given the equation $\\frac{3}{5}w = \\frac{4}{3}$. To solve for $w$, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n$$\\frac{3}{5}w = \\frac{4}{3} \\Rightarrow 3w = 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3$ to get:\n\n$$w = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{20}{9}$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $w$ is [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Always follow the correct steps to solve the problem.\n3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n4. Use the correct mathematical operations (e.g., multiplication, division) and avoid confusion between them.\n5. Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the common factor of $3$.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always approach math problems with a clear and organized mindset.\n* Break down complex problems into simpler subproblems and solve each one step-by-step.\n* Use visual aids (e.g., diagrams, graphs) to help you visualize the problem and find the solution.\n* Practice regularly to improve your math skills and build confidence.\n"
