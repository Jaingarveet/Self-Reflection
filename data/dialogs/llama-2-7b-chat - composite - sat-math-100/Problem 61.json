        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by calculating the weight of the object on Earth instead of Mercury. I realized my mistake and adjusted my solution accordingly.\n\nTo find the weight of an object on Mercury, we need to use the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury in meters per second squared.\n\nUsing the information provided in the table, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury is $g = 3.6 \\frac{m}{\\sec^{2}}$.\n\nNow, let's plug in the values we know:\n\n$W = mg$\n$W = 90 \\text{ kg} \\times 3.6 \\frac{m}{\\sec^{2}}$\n$W = 324 \\frac{N}{kg}$\n\nTherefore, the weight of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kilograms is 324 newtons.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) 324.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving problems involving different planets and their gravitational forces, it's essential to use the correct formula and plug in the appropriate values. It's also important to double-check your work to ensure you're getting the correct answer."
