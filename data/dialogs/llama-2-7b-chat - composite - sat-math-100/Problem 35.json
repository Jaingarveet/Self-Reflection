To solve for the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, we need to isolate the variable $x$.\n\nI. $x = 4$\n\nSo, $x - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 4$.\n\nII. $x = 9$\n\nSo, $\\sqrt{4x} = \\sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3 = 6$\n\nTherefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 9$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation of the Correct Answer:\n\nThe correct answer is (B) because the equation $\\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$ can be solved for $x$ in two ways: $x = 4$ and $x = 9$. Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 4$ and $x = 9$.\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
