I misunderstood the model and calculated the increase in height per year incorrectly.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstood the model\n* Calculated the increase in height per year incorrectly\n\nSolution:\n\nTo find the estimated increase in height per year, we need to solve for the coefficient of $a$ in the model.\n\n$$h = 3a + 28.6$$\n\nSubtracting $28.6$ from both sides gives us:\n\n$$h = 3a$$\n\nDividing both sides by $3$ gives us:\n\n$$a = \\frac{h}{3}$$\n\nNow, we can find the increase in height per year by subtracting the age of the boy at the beginning of the period from his age at the end of the period:\n\n$$\\Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = \\frac{h_2}{3} - \\frac{h_1}{3}$$\n\nWhere $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the heights of the boy at the beginning and end of the period, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the estimated increase in height per year is:\n\n$$\\Delta h = \\frac{h_2 - h_1}{3} = \\frac{h}{3} - \\frac{h}{3} = \\frac{h}{9}$$\n\nCorrect Answer: B - $\\quad 5.7$\n\nAdvice:\n\nWhen solving a problem, it's essential to carefully read and understand the question, including any given information or constraints. Make sure to break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, and use the appropriate mathematical techniques to solve it. In this case, we needed to divide the height by 3 to find the increase in height per year. Finally, double-check your answer to ensure it's correct."
