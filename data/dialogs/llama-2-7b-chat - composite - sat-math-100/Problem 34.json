(Assume there is no sales tax.)\n\nReflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I reflected on my solution and the correct answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstood the percentage discount\n* Did not calculate the original price correctly\n\nSolution:\n\nTo find the original price of the book, we need to calculate 40% of the sale price and subtract it from the sale price.\n\n40% of $\\$ 18.00$ = $\\$ 7.20$\n\nSo, the original price of the book was $\\$ 18.00 - \\$ 7.20 = \\$ 10.80$.\n\nAdvice:\n\nWhen solving a problem, it's essential to read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked. In this case, I misunderstood the percentage discount and calculated the wrong answer. Always double-check your work and use the correct formula to ensure you get the right answer."
