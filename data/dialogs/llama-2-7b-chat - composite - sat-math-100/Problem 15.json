Now, let's apply those skills to the current question.\n\nThe question asks us to find the value of $6r + 3$ given that $3r = 18$.\n\nTo start, we can use the equation $3r = 18$ to isolate $r$.\n\n$3r = 18 \\Rightarrow r = 6$\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $r$ into the second equation:\n\n$6r + 3 = ?$\n\nCan you take it from here and find the value of $6r + 3$?"
