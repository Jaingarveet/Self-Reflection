What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?\nChoices:\n  A: -0.5\n  B: -0.25\n  C: 0.8\n  D: 1.75\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].\n\nTo find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point of the system of equations, we need to solve the first equation for $x$ and then substitute the solution into the second equation.\n\nSolving the first equation for $x$, we get:\n\n$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$\n\n$x = 0.3 / 2.4$\n\n$x = 0.125$\n\nNow, substituting the value of $x$ into the second equation:\n\n$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$\n\n$1.6(0.125) + 0.5y = -1.3$\n\n$0.19 + 0.5y = -1.3$\n\n$0.7y = -1.41$\n\n$y = -2.02$\n\nTherefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $x = 0.125$, which corresponds to the answer (B) [REDACTED].\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the answer key. The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n\n* Always check your calculations and ensure that they are correct.\n* When solving a system of equations, it is important to isolate each variable separately and then substitute the solutions into the other equation.\n* When solving for $x$, always divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of $x$.\n* When solving for $y$, always divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of $y$.\n* Always check your work by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ into one of the equations and verifying that the result is true.\n"
