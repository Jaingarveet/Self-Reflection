Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\n  B: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\n  C: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\n  D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct equation to determine how many fewer miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$ is:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) $\\frac{4}{25} m = 5$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Arithmetic error\n* Division error\n\nSolution:\n\nTo reduce Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$, he needs to drive fewer miles. Let's use the equation:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$\n\nWhere $m$ is the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$$m = \\frac{95}{25}$$\n\nSo, Alan should drive $5$ fewer miles each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the problem and the goal.\n2. Write the equation that represents the problem.\n3. Solve the equation to find the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always use the correct equation to solve the problem.\n* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"
