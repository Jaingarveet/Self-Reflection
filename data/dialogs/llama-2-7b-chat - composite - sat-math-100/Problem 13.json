Therefore, I will use algebraic methods to solve it.\n\nError Keywords: Factoring error, Misinterpretation\n\nSolution:\nThe equation is $\\sqrt{k+2} - x = 0$. To solve for $k$, we can use the formula for the square root of a number: $\\sqrt{n} = x$ if and only if $n = x^2$.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2} = x$$\n\n$$k + 2 = x^2$$\n\n$$k = x^2 - 2$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $k$ by subtracting $2$ from both sides of the equation:\n\n$$k = x^2 - 2$$\n\n$$k = x^2 - 2$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $k$ is $x^2 - 2$.\n\nAnswer: $B$\n\nExplanation:\nThe value of $k$ is $x^2 - 2$. Since $x = 9$, we have $k = 9^2 - 2 = 81 - 2 = 79$. Therefore, the correct answer is $D$."
