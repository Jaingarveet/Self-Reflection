What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of a right circular cylinder with twice the radius and half the height of cylinder A?\nChoices:\n  A: 11\n  B: 22\n  C: 44\n  D: 66\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly identified the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder (V = πr^2h) and applied it to the problem. However, I made an error in my calculation.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Calculation error\n* Formula application error\n* Radius miscalculation\n\nSolution:\nThe volume of the first cylinder is [REDACTED] cubic centimeters.\nThe radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.\nThe height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.\nUsing the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:\nV = π(1/2)^2 \\* 2h = π \\* 1/4 \\* 2 \\* [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] cubic centimeters\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder.\n2. Apply the formula to the problem, using the given information.\n3. Calculate the volume of the second cylinder using the formula and the given information.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always use the correct formula for the problem, and apply it correctly.\n* Always calculate each subproblem step-by-step, and double-check your calculations.\n* Always use the correct units for the problem, and make sure they are consistent throughout the calculation.\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before starting the calculation.\n"
