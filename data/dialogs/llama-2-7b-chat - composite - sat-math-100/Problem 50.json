There are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. If there is a total of 18 left-handed students and 122 right-handed students in the school, which of the following is closest to the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female?

        "content": "  Reflection:\nI previously answered this question as follows:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realize that my answer is incorrect. The correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe problem states that there are 5 times as many right-handed female students as there are left-handed female students, and there are 9 times as many right-handed male students as there are left-handed male students. This means that the number of right-handed students is 5 times the number of left-handed students, and the number of right-handed male students is 9 times the number of left-handed male students.\n\nFrom here, we can use the total number of students (18 + 122 = 140) to find the probability of a right-handed student being female. We know that there are 18 left-handed students, so the number of right-handed students is 140 - 18 = 122. Of these right-handed students, 9 times as many are male as are female, so the number of right-handed male students is 122 x 9 = 109. Therefore, the probability of a right-handed student being female is:\n\nProbability = Number of right-handed female students / Total number of students\n= 18 / 140\n= 0.128\n\nSo, the closest answer is (A) 0.410.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving this problem, it is important to carefully read the information given and to use the correct formulas to calculate the probabilities. It is also helpful to use visual aids, such as a table or diagram, to organize the information and make it easier to see the relationships between the different groups."
