I correctly set up the equation $y = kx$ and substituted $x = [REDACTED]$ to get $y = 12$.

When $x = 6$, we have $y = 24$.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n$$y = kx$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 5$, we get:\n\n$$y = k(5)$$\n\nWhat is the value of $k$? We are given that $y = 24$ when $x = 6$, so we can write:\n\n$$k = \\frac{y}{x}$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 6$, we get:\n\n$$k = \\frac{24}{6} = 4$$\n\nNow, we can substitute $k = 4$ into the equation $y = kx$:\n\n$$y = 4x$$\n\nSubstituting $x = 5$, we get:\n\n$$y = 4(5) = 20$$\n\nSo, the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ is $20$. ðŸ˜Š\n\nI hope this helps!
