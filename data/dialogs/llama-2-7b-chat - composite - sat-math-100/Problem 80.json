For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{12}{5}$\n  B: $\\frac{16}{7}$\n  C: $-\\frac{16}{7}$\n  D: $-\\frac{12}{5}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nGreat job! You correctly identified the value of $k$ that will result in no solution for the system of equations.\n\nTo explain why your answer is correct, let's go through the steps you took:\n\n1. You solved the first equation for $x$ to get $x = \\frac{4k}{3} + \\frac{7}{3}y$.\n2. You substituted this expression for $x$ into the second equation, which gave you an inconsistent equation: $\\frac{16k}{9} + \\frac{21}{3}y = 7$.\n3. You recognized that if $k = -\\frac{16}{7}$, then the equation will be inconsistent, as $\\frac{16k}{9} = -\\frac{16}{7}$ and $\\frac{21}{3}y = 7$.\n4. Therefore, you concluded that the value of $k$ that will result in no solution is $k = -\\frac{16}{7}$.\n\nGreat job! Your reasoning and calculations are correct.\n\nAs for the other options, here's why they are incorrect:\n\nA) [REDACTED] is not a value of $k$ that will result in no solution. In fact, this value of $k$ will result in a consistent system of equations.\n\nB) [REDACTED] is also not a value of $k$ that will result in no solution.\n\nC) [REDACTED] is the correct value of $k$ that will result in no solution.\n\nD) [REDACTED] is not a value of $k$ that will result in no solution. In fact, this value of $k$ will result in a consistent system of equations.\n\nGreat job on this question! Keep up the good work.\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
