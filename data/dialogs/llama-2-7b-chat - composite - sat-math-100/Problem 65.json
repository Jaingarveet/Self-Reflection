For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function.\n  B: The function $f$ is an increasing linear function.\n  C: The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function.\n  D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nYou have correctly identified that the function $f(n)$ is an increasing linear function. Well done!\n\nThe problem states that for each of the next 5 years, Eleanor invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. This means that the rate at which the number of people invited is increasing is 100% per year.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how the number of people invited would increase over time:\n\nYear 1: 30 people\nYear 2: 60 people (double the number of people invited in Year 1)\nYear 3: 120 people (double the number of people invited in Year 2)\nYear 4: 240 people (double the number of people invited in Year 3)\nYear 5: 480 people (double the number of people invited in Year 4)\n\nAs you can see, the number of people invited to the fund-raiser increases linearly with each passing year, at a rate of 100% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) An increasing exponential function.\n\nGreat job!\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function. I realized my mistake after reviewing the problem and the correct answer.\n\nThe problem states that for each of the next 5 years, Eleanor invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. This means that the rate at which the number of people invited is increasing is 100% per year.\n\nTo determine the correct answer, I analyzed the problem and identified that the number of people invited to the fund-raiser increases linearly with each passing year, at a rate of 100% per year. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) An increasing exponential function.\n\nI will make sure to carefully analyze the problem and consider the given information when answering similar questions in the future.
