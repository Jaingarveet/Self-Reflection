The equation of the line is $y = 25$, and it intersects the parabola at two points, $A$ and $B$. To find the length of $\\overline{A B}$, I need to use the distance formula, which is $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe correct answer is (C) 14. To see why, let's plug in the values for $x_1 = 2$ and $y_1 = 13$ for point $A$, and $x_2 = 4$ and $y_2 = 21$ for point $B$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Solution: The mistake in my previous answer was that I did not use the correct equation of the line.\n* Instructions: Make sure to use the correct equation of the line and the distance formula to find the length of $\\overline{A B}$.\n* Advice: Take your time to carefully read the problem and understand the equation of the line and the parabola. Use the distance formula to find the length of $\\overline{A B}$."
