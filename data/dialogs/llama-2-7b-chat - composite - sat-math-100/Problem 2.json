I see that I made a mistake in my calculation, and the correct answer is [B].\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe expression given in the question is:\n\n$$(x^2 y - 3 y^2 + 5 x y^2) - (-x^2 y + 3 x y^2 - 3 y^2)$$\n\nTo find the equivalent expression, we need to isolate the variable y.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms:\n\n$$(x^2 y - 3 y^2 + 5 x y^2) - (-x^2 y + 3 x y^2 - 3 y^2) = (x^2 - 3) y^2 + 5 x y^2 - 3 y^2$$\n\nNow, we can see that the expression is equivalent to $4 x^2 y^2$. Therefore, the correct answer is [A].\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving math problems, it's important to carefully read the question and understand what is being asked. In this case, I mistakenly added the wrong terms in my calculation, which led to an incorrect answer. Always double-check your work and simplify expressions to find the correct solution."
