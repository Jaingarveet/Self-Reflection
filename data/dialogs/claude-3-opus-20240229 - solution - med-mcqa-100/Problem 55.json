On CECT chest there was a tumor of 5x5 cm in upper lobe and another 2x2 cm size tumor nodule in middle lobe. The primary modality of treatment is :\nChoices:\n  A: Radiotherapy\n  B: Chemotherapy\n  C: Surgery\n  D: Suppoive treatment\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. The patient has a 5x5 cm primary tumor in the right upper lobe and a 2x2 cm nodule in the right middle lobe. \n2. Both lesions are confined to the right lung with no evidence of distant metastases mentioned.\n3. In the absence of distant metastases, the presence of a separate tumor nodule in the same lobe (T3) or different ipsilateral lobe (T4) still potentially allows for surgical resection if the patient has adequate lung function.\n4. Complete surgical resection of both lesions would be the preferred primary treatment if feasible, as it provides the best chance for cure in localized non-small cell lung cancer.\n5. [REDACTED] and radiation would likely be recommended after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence, but surgery is still the primary modality.\n"

The patient has two separate tumor nodules in the right lung - a 5x5 cm lesion in the upper lobe and a 2x2 cm lesion in the middle lobe. \n2. There is no mention of distant metastases outside the lung.\n3. When lung cancer is localized to one lung, even with separate tumor nodules in the same or different lobes, surgical resection of all lesions is potentially curative if the patient has adequate lung function.\n4. Surgery would be the primary treatment modality to remove all visible cancer, likely followed by chemotherapy and radiation to reduce recurrence risk.\n5. Chemotherapy and radiation alone, without surgery, would be less likely to be curative compared to complete surgical resection in this scenario.\nTherefore, based on the staging and treatment principles for localized non-small cell lung cancer, the best primary treatment modality is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
