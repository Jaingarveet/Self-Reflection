The \"cobra head\" sign is a radiologic finding seen on imaging studies like voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP).\n2. This sign is characterized by a dilated distal ureter that protrudes into the bladder, resembling the head of a cobra snake.\n3. [REDACTED] ureterocele is a congenital anomaly where the distal ureter balloons into the bladder, causing a cystic dilatation.\n4. This cystic dilatation of the distal ureter gives the characteristic \"cobra head\" appearance on imaging.\n5. While posterior urethral valves, rectocele, and bladder tumors can cause urinary tract obstruction, they do not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n"

From the previous reflection, we know that ureterocele is a congenital anomaly where the distal ureter balloons into the bladder, causing a cystic dilatation. This matches the description of the \"cobra head\" sign.\n4. While posterior urethral valves, rectocele, and bladder tumors can cause urinary tract obstruction, the reflection notes that they do not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign.\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided and the previous reflection, the correct answer is ureterocele.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
