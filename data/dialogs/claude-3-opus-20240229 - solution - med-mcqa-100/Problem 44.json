MgSO4 infusion is started for seizure prophylaxis and planned to induce labor. Her cervix is 3cm dilated, slightly soft and located anteriorly. Fetal head is at -1 station, and length of cervix is < 0.5cm. What is her Bishop score\nChoices:\n  A: 7\n  B: 8\n  C: 9\n  D: 10\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven information:\n - Cervical dilation: 3 cm \n - Cervical consistency: Slightly soft\n - Cervical position: Anterior \n - Fetal station: -1\n - Cervical length: < 0.5 cm\nCalculating Bishop score:\n1. Cervical dilation of 3 cm = 2 points\n2. Slightly soft cervical consistency = 1 point \n3. Anterior cervical position = 1 point\n4. Fetal station of -1 = 1 point\n5. Cervical length < 0.5 cm = 2 points\nTotal Bishop score = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = [REDACTED] points\nHowever, [REDACTED] points corresponds to choice [REDACTED], which is incorrect.\nLet's recheck the addition: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = [REDACTED] points\nTherefore, the correct Bishop score is [REDACTED], which corresponds to choice [REDACTED].\n"
