[REDACTED]: The funnel-shaped distal end, closest to the ovary. Relatively wide.\n2. [REDACTED]: The widest and longest part, where fertilization usually occurs. Not the narrowest.\n3. [REDACTED]: The narrow, straight segment connecting the ampulla to the uterus. Narrower than infundibulum and ampulla.\n4. [REDACTED]: The segment passing through the uterine wall. The narrowest part of the uterine tube.\nTherefore, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the interstitial portion.\n"
