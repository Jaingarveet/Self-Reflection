Islet cell transplantation is a procedure to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n2. In this procedure, islet cells (which produce insulin) are harvested from a donor pancreas.\n3. The harvested islet cells are then injected into the portal vein of the recipient.\n4. The portal vein carries blood from the intestines and pancreas to the liver.\n5. By injecting the cells into the portal vein, they are carried to the liver, where they can engraft in the liver sinusoids and start producing insulin.\n6. The liver provides a good site for the cells due to its rich blood supply and relatively immunologically privileged environment.\nTherefore, the correct site of transplantation for islet cells in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is via injection into the portal vein.\n"

In islet cell transplantation for diabetes, the harvested islet cells are injected into the portal vein of the recipient.\n2. The portal vein carries the cells to the liver, where they engraft and start producing insulin.\n3. The liver provides a good environment for the transplanted cells due to its blood supply and relatively immunologically privileged status.\nTherefore, injecting the islet cells into the portal vein, which carries them to the liver, is the correct site for transplantation in this procedure."
