        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Randomization is a key principle in designing research studies. It helps ensure the study groups are comparable and the results are not biased.\n2. When subjects are randomized, each subject has the same probability of being assigned to any of the study groups. \n3. This probability is known ahead of time based on the study design. For example, in a study with two groups, each subject would have a 50% chance of being in either group.\n4. However, while the probability is known, the actual group assignment for any given subject is unknown until they are randomized. It's determined randomly at the time of assignment.\n5. So in summary, randomization implies each subject has an equal and known probability of being assigned to any group, but their ultimate assigned group is unknown until the actual randomization.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that random in randomization implies equal and known chances.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
