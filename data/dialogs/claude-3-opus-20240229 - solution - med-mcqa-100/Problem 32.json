Biopsy finding is also shown below.

It also states that biopsy findings are shown, which would be essential in differentiating between the given choices. \n[REDACTED], [REDACTED], and rhinosporidiosis can all present with similar symptoms of nasal obstruction and blood-tinged discharge. However, each condition has characteristic histopathological findings that help in making the correct diagnosis.\nWithout seeing the actual biopsy findings, it is impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. The correct answer, rhinosporidiosis, would be confirmed by the presence of fungal sporangia on histopathology, which is a unique feature of this condition.\n"

Histopathological findings on biopsy are essential to differentiate between these conditions and make the correct diagnosis.\n4. Rhinosporidiosis has a unique histopathological feature - the presence of fungal sporangia.
