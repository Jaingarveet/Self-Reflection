Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over the vertebra below it.\n2. The key diagnostic feature is the forward slippage, best seen on lateral view X-rays.\n3. [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is a crucial investigation as it clearly demonstrates the forward slippage.\n4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] provide additional detailed information about bony abnormalities, nerve compression, and soft tissue involvement.\n5. Anteroposterior (AP) X-ray is not particularly useful in diagnosing spondylolisthesis as it does not show the forward slippage effectively.\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDA[REDACTED]ED]: [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is NOT a useful investigation for spondylolisthesis.\n"

This view allows clear visualization of any forward slippage of one vertebra over another, which is the defining feature of spondylolisthesis.\nCT and MRI can provide additional useful information like bony detail, nerve compression, and soft tissue involvement. However, they are supplementary and the lateral X-ray remains most important.\nThe anteroposterior (front-back) X-ray does not effectively demonstrate forward vertebral slippage. While it may show other spinal abnormalities, it is not particularly helpful in diagnosing spondylolisthesis specifically.\nTherefore, of the choices provided, the anteroposterior X-ray is the least useful in evaluating suspected spondylolisthesis.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
