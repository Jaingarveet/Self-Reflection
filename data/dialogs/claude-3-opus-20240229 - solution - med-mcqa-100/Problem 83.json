The other choices are buttocks, trunk, and upper limb. The self-reflection specifically mentions that the thigh is preferred over the buttocks due to lower risk of contamination and infection.\n4. The trunk and upper limb are not mentioned in the self-reflection, suggesting they are not the best choices.\n5. Therefore, based on the information provided in the self-reflection, the best answer is the thigh.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
