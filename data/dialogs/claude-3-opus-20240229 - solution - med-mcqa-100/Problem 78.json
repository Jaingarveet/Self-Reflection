The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery.\n2. It ascends tortuously along the side of the face, deep to the Platysma and Risorius muscles.\n3. At the angle of the mouth, it gives off the superior and inferior labial arteries.\n4. It then ascends along the side of the nose as the angular artery.\n5. The angular artery terminates in an anastomosis with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery, between the eye and the nose.\n6. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the eye and surrounding structures.\nTherefore, the facial artery terminates in an anastomosis with a branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n"

The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that runs along the side of the face.\n2. It gives off labial arteries at the angle of the mouth.\n3. It then continues along the side of the nose as the angular artery. \n4. The self-reflection states that the angular artery terminates by anastomosing with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery, between the eye and nose.\n5. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid that supplies the eye region.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. Opposite side facial artery - Incorrect, the self-reflection does not mention this.\nB. Transverse facial artery - Incorrect, not mentioned in the reflection.  \nC. Anastomosis with infraorbital artery - Incorrect, the infraorbital artery is not mentioned.\nD. Branch of the ophthalmic artery - Correct! The reflection states it anastomoses with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery.\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
