These include:\n[REDA[REDACTED]ED]: [REDA[REDACTED]ED] - This can show if any vertebrae have slipped forward.\n[REDA[REDACTED]ED]: [REDACTED] - This can provide a more detailed look at the spine and can show if there are any fractures or other problems.\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This can provide detailed images of the soft tissues and nerves around the spine.\n[REDA[REDACTED]ED]: [REDA[REDACTED]ED] - While this can show the alignment of the vertebrae, it does not provide as much detail as the other investigations and is therefore not as useful.\n"
