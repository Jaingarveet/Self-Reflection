Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the face.\n2. It runs upward and forward, beneath the Platysma and the Digastric muscles, along the side of the face, to the angle of the mouth.\n3. At the angle of the mouth, the facial artery anastomoses (connects) with the terminal branches of the opposite facial artery.\n4. The facial artery also anastomoses with the infraorbital artery (a branch of the maxillary artery), but this is not its terminal anastomosis.\n5. The transverse facial artery is a branch of the superficial temporal artery, not the facial artery.\n6. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery, not the external carotid artery like the facial artery.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the facial artery terminates in the anastomosis with the opposite side of the facial artery.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly identified the terminal anastomosis of the facial artery. I focused too narrowly on the facial artery itself and its more proximal anastomoses, rather than following it to its true terminal branches. My knowledge of the distal anatomy of the facial artery was incomplete.\nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete anatomical knowledge\n - Focused on proximal anatomy only\n - Did not trace artery to terminal branches\n - Facial artery anatomy\nSolution:\n1. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery.\n2. It ascends tortuously along the side of the face, deep to the Platysma and Risorius muscles.\n3. At the angle of the mouth, it gives off the superior and inferior labial arteries.\n4. It then ascends along the side of the nose as the angular artery.\n5. The angular artery terminates in an anastomosis with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery, between the eye and the nose.\n6. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the eye and surrounding structures.\nTherefore, the facial artery terminates in an anastomosis with a branch of the ophthalmic artery.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the origin of the facial artery (external carotid).\n2. Trace the course of the facial artery along the face.\n3. Identify the named branches of the facial artery.\n4. Follow the terminal branch of the facial artery (angular artery).\n5. Determine what the angular artery anastomoses with at its terminal end.\n6. Identify the origin of the artery that the angular artery anastomoses with (ophthalmic artery from internal carotid).\nAdvice:\n - Always trace arteries from their origin to their terminal branches.\n - Be aware of anastomoses between terminal branches of arteries from different origins.\n - Consider the full course and relations of an artery, not just its proximal segments.\n - Know the branches and supply of the major arteries of the head (carotid, maxillary, ophthalmic).\n - Use the anatomical location and course of an artery to reason out its relations and anastomoses."
