Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite causing falciparum malaria, preferentially invades senescent red blood cells. However, it is actually Plasmodium malariae, the parasite responsible for quartan malaria, that has a greater affinity for older, senescent red blood cells. My knowledge gap was in the specific red blood cell preferences of different malaria parasites.\nError Keywords:\n- Incorrect parasite-host cell association\n- Malaria parasite red blood cell preference\n- Plasmodium species host cell specificity\nSolution:\nSenescent red blood cells are older red blood cells that are nearing the end of their lifespan. Among the different species of malaria parasites, Plasmodium malariae, which causes quartan malaria, has a greater affinity for invading and multiplying within these older, senescent red blood cells. In contrast, Plasmodium falciparum (falciparum malaria), Plasmodium vivax (vivax malaria), and Plasmodium ovale (ovale malaria) prefer to invade younger red blood cells.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the key terms in the question (senescent RBCs, malaria types).\n2. Recall the specific red blood cell preferences of each malaria parasite species:\n   - P. malariae (quartan malaria) prefers senescent RBCs\n   - P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale prefer younger RBCs\n3. Select the malaria type that matches the red blood cell preference mentioned in the question.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the specific parasite-host cell association.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and identify the key terms.\n- Understand the specific characteristics and preferences of different malaria parasites.\n- Remember that different Plasmodium species have different red blood cell preferences.\n- Always double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the specific parasite-host cell association.\n- If unsure about the specific preferences of a parasite, take a moment to recall or look up the information before answering."
