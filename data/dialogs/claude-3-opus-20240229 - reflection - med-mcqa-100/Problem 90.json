        "content": "Topic: Medicine\nSubtopic: Gynaecology & Obstetrics\nQuestion: At 34 weeks multigravida with previous 2 normal delivery has an unstable lie with the present pregnancy. It can be due to:\nChoices:\n  A: Oligohydramnios\n  B: Placenta pre\n  C: Pelvic tumor\n  D: Uterine anomalies\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n1. An unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida (a woman who has been pregnant more than once) can be caused by various factors that prevent the fetus from settling into a stable position.\n2. Oligohydramnios (choice A) is a condition with decreased amniotic fluid. This can allow the fetus to move more freely and change position, leading to an unstable lie.\n3. Placenta previa (choice B) is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. This can prevent the fetal head from engaging in the pelvis, potentially causing an unstable lie.\n4. A pelvic tumor (choice C) can obstruct the pelvis and prevent the fetus from descending into a stable position, leading to an unstable lie.\n5. Uterine anomalies (choice D), such as a bicornuate uterus or a septate uterus, can distort the shape of the uterine cavity and prevent the fetus from settling into a stable lie.\nIn conclusion, all of the listed choices - oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, and uterine anomalies - can potentially cause an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that all the listed choices could cause an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida. While oligohydramnios, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies can contribute to an unstable lie, placenta previa is the most likely cause among the given options. I failed to prioritize the most probable cause based on the clinical scenario.\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete clinical reasoning\n- Failure to prioritize probable causes\n- Lack of discrimination between options\n- Insufficient obstetric knowledge\nSolution:\n1. The question presents a case of a multigravida at 34 weeks with an unstable lie.\n2. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervical os.\n3. Placenta previa can prevent the fetal head from engaging in the pelvis, leading to an unstable lie.\n4. While other conditions like oligohydramnios, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies can contribute to an unstable lie, placenta previa is the most probable cause among the given options.\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Placenta previa.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the clinical scenario carefully, noting key information like gestational age and obstetric history.\n2. Identify the main clinical finding or problem, in this case, an unstable lie.\n3. Consider the potential causes of the clinical finding among the given options.\n4. Prioritize the most likely cause based on the clinical scenario and your knowledge of obstetrics.\n5. Eliminate less likely options, even if they can potentially contribute to the clinical finding.\n6. Choose the best answer that fits the given information and the most probable cause.\nAdvice:\n- Always consider the clinical context when answering questions, including patient history and gestational age.\n- Prioritize the most likely diagnoses or causes based on the given scenario.\n- Don't assume all options are equally probable; use your clinical judgment to discriminate between choices.\n- Brush up on your knowledge of obstetric conditions and their impact on fetal position and stability.\n- Eliminate options that are less likely, even if they can potentially contribute to the clinical finding.\n- Focus on the most probable cause among the given choices, rather than trying to find a choice that fits all possible causes."
