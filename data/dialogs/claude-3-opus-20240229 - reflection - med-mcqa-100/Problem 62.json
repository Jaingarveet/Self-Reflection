Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Infundibulum: This is the funnel-shaped distal end of the uterine tube, closest to the ovary. It is relatively wide to capture the ovum released during ovulation.\nB. Ampulla: This is the widest and longest part of the uterine tube, where fertilization usually occurs. It is not the narrowest segment.\nC. Isthmus: This is the narrow, straight segment of the uterine tube that connects the ampulla to the uterus. It is the narrowest part of the uterine tube.\nD. Interstitial: This is the segment of the uterine tube that passes through the uterine wall. While it is relatively narrow, it is not the narrowest part of the tube.\nTherefore, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the isthmus.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly identified the isthmus as the narrowest part of the uterine tube. While the isthmus is indeed narrow, I failed to consider that the interstitial portion, which passes through the uterine wall, is even narrower. My knowledge gap was in the relative sizes of the different segments of the uterine tube.\nError Keywords:\n - Anatomical misconception\n - Relative size misunderstanding\n - Uterine tube segment confusion\nSolution:\nThe uterine tube (fallopian tube) has four main segments:\n1. Infundibulum: The funnel-shaped distal end, closest to the ovary. Relatively wide.\n2. Ampulla: The widest and longest part, where fertilization usually occurs. Not the narrowest.\n3. Isthmus: The narrow, straight segment connecting the ampulla to the uterus. Narrower than infundibulum and ampulla.\n4. Interstitial: The segment passing through the uterine wall. The narrowest part of the uterine tube.\nTherefore, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the interstitial portion.\nInstructions:\n1. Recall the four main segments of the uterine tube: infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus, and interstitial.\n2. Visualize the relative sizes and shapes of each segment.\n3. Identify the segment with the smallest diameter or cross-sectional area.\n4. Remember that the interstitial portion passes through the uterine wall, making it the narrowest.\n5. Select the answer choice that corresponds to the interstitial segment.\nAdvice:\n - Always review the anatomy and relative sizes of structures when answering questions about narrowest or widest portions.\n - Visualize the structures in your mind to better understand their relationships and sizes.\n - Consider the function and location of each structure to help determine its likely size.\n - Be cautious of answer choices that seem correct but may not be the most accurate option.\n - When unsure, take the time to systematically compare each answer choice to rule out incorrect options."
