Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The axillary artery is the main artery of the upper limb. It is divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle.\n2. If the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb can be maintained by anastomoses (connections) between branches of the axillary artery.\n3. The branches of the second part of the axillary artery are:\n   - Lateral thoracic artery\n   - Thoracoacromial artery\n   - Subscapular artery, which gives off the circumflex scapular artery\n4. The posterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery.\n5. The suprascapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery are not branches of the axillary artery. They arise from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery.\n6. Therefore, the anastomosis that would maintain blood supply in case of obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery is between the subscapular artery (a branch of the second part) and the posterior circumflex humeral artery (a branch of the third part).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly identified the anastomosis that would maintain blood supply in case of obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery. I focused on the branches of the axillary artery itself, but failed to consider the anastomoses with arteries that are not direct branches of the axillary artery.\nError Keywords:\n - Anatomical misconception\n - Incomplete knowledge of collateral circulation\n - Focusing only on direct branches\nSolution:\n1. The axillary artery is the main artery of the upper limb, divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle.\n2. If the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb can be maintained by anastomoses with arteries that are not direct branches of the axillary artery.\n3. The deep branch of the transverse cervical artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery.\n4. The subscapular artery is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery.\n5. There is an important anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery.\n6. This anastomosis can provide collateral circulation to the upper limb if the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the anatomy of the axillary artery and its branches.\n2. Consider not only the direct branches of the axillary artery, but also the arteries that anastomose with these branches.\n3. Know the origins of these anastomosing arteries (e.g., from the subclavian artery).\n4. Understand the concept of collateral circulation and how it can maintain blood supply in case of arterial obstruction.\n5. Eliminate answer choices that involve only direct branches of the axillary artery.\n6. Choose the answer that involves an anastomosis between a branch of the axillary artery and an artery that is not a direct branch of the axillary artery.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the bigger picture in anatomy, not just isolated structures.\n - Pay attention to anastomoses and collateral circulation pathways.\n - Know the origins and courses of major arteries and their branches.\n - Understand the clinical implications of arterial obstruction and how collateral circulation can compensate.\n - Eliminate answer choices systematically based on your anatomical knowledge.\n - If unsure, reason through each answer choice carefully before selecting one."
