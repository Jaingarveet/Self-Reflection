Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The \"cobra head\" appearance is a radiologic sign, typically seen on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP).\n2. This sign is characterized by a dilated posterior urethra that abruptly narrows, resembling the head of a cobra snake.\n3. The posterior urethral valve is a congenital condition where there is a membrane-like valve in the posterior urethra, causing obstruction to urine flow.\n4. This obstruction leads to dilatation of the posterior urethra proximal to the valve, giving the characteristic \"cobra head\" appearance on imaging.\n5. Rectocele, ureterocele, and bladder tumors can cause urinary obstruction but do not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\nThe \"cobra head\" appearance is most commonly associated with posterior urethral valves.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly associated the \"cobra head\" appearance with posterior urethral valves. While posterior urethral valves can cause urinary obstruction, the \"cobra head\" sign is actually more characteristic of ureteroceles. I confused the radiologic appearance of these two conditions.\nError Keywords:\n - Radiologic sign confusion\n - Urinary tract anomaly misidentification\n - Posterior urethral valve vs. ureterocele mix-up\nSolution:\n1. The \"cobra head\" sign is a radiologic finding seen on imaging studies like voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP).\n2. This sign is characterized by a dilated distal ureter that protrudes into the bladder, resembling the head of a cobra snake.\n3. A ureterocele is a congenital anomaly where the distal ureter balloons into the bladder, causing a cystic dilatation.\n4. This cystic dilatation of the distal ureter gives the characteristic \"cobra head\" appearance on imaging.\n5. While posterior urethral valves, rectocele, and bladder tumors can cause urinary tract obstruction, they do not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB: Ureterocele\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and note the key radiologic sign mentioned.\n2. Recall the definition and appearance of the radiologic sign.\n3. Consider each answer choice and determine which condition best matches the radiologic sign.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that do not typically present with the mentioned radiologic sign.\n5. Select the answer choice that most closely associates with the given radiologic finding.\nAdvice:\n - Familiarize yourself with common radiologic signs and their associated conditions.\n - When answering questions about radiologic findings, visualize the appearance of each condition.\n - Eliminate answer choices that do not match the key radiologic finding mentioned in the question.\n - If unsure, use the process of elimination to narrow down the possible correct answers.\n - Remember that some radiologic signs are highly specific for certain conditions, while others may be more nonspecific."
