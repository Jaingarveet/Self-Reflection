Read the question carefully and note all the given information.\n2. Identify the key requirements (in this case, tall, handsome, and doctor).\n3. Analyze each piece of information and make deductions based on it.\n4. Eliminate the options that contradict the given information.\n5. If there's only one option left that fits all the criteria, that's the answer.\n6. If multiple options fit, try to find additional information that can distinguish them.\n7.

Among the 4 men:\n   - 3 are tall\n   - 2 are doctors (Wang Wei and Wu Gang)\n   - 1 is handsome\n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height. Since there are 3 tall men total, either both Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are tall, or both are not tall.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. This means Li Qiang cannot be tall (because if he was, Wang Wei would also have to be tall to make 3 tall men total, contradicting this statement). \n   Therefore, Liu Dawei is also not tall (since he's the same height as Li Qiang).\n5. Since Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are both not tall, they cannot meet all the requirements. We can eliminate them.\n6. Between Wang Wei and Wu Gang, we know both are doctors. To determine who is tall and handsome:\n   - If Wang Wei was tall, then Wu Gang and one of Liu Dawei/Li Qiang would have to be the other two tall men. But we determined Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are not tall. So Wang Wei cannot be tall.\n   - Therefore, Wu Gang must be tall. He is also a doctor. If he is handsome, he meets all the requirements.\n7. Wu Gang is the only one who could be tall, handsome, and a doctor without contradicting any of the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
