(1) Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time; (2) Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time; (3) Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\nQuestion: If He Zhilian is not selected, which of the following is not selected?\nChoices:\n  A: Tang Xiaohua\n  B: Peng Youwen\n  C: Qiu Zhijie\n  D: Song Wenkai\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and note all the given conditions and constraints.\n2. Identify the fixed selections based on the question (e.g., He Zhilian not being selected).\n3. Consider the implications of each fixed selection on the remaining choices, based on the given conditions.\n4. Methodically consider each remaining choice and check if it violates any conditions, either directly or indirectly.\n5. Eliminate choices that lead to violations of the conditions.\n6. Identify the choice(s) that cannot be selected under any valid scenario.\n"

Condition (1) says Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected. \n3. The three boys must be selected from Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai.\n4. Condition (2) says Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together. \n   Condition (3) says Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together. But Tang Xiaohua is already not selected, so condition (3) doesn't constrain the remaining choices.\n5. To satisfy condition (2), the valid boy combinations are:\n   - Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang \n   - Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai\n6. In both valid combinations, Ren Xiangyang is always selected. Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie and Song Wenkai each appear in one of the two valid combinations.\n7. Therefore, the only person who cannot be selected under any valid scenario is Tang Xiaohua.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
