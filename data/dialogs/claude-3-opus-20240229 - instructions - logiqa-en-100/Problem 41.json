The given information states:\n   - Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy.\n   - If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve a 20% increase.\n2. Let's analyze each answer choice:\n   A) If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.\n      - This is not necessarily true. The information states that a 10% increase is needed to avoid bankruptcy, not 20%.\n   B) In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.\n      - This must be true. If a 10% increase prevents bankruptcy, and a 10% increase implies a 20% increase is possible, then a 20% increase will certainly prevent bankruptcy.\n   C) If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.\n      - This contradicts the given information, which states that a 10% increase is needed to avoid bankruptcy due to recent market changes.\n   D) In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.\n      - This contradicts the given information, which states that if a 10% increase is possible, then a 20% increase can be achieved.\n3. Eliminate choices A, C, and D because they are either not necessarily true or contradict the given information.\n4. Choose B as the answer that must be true based on the logical implications of the given statements.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
