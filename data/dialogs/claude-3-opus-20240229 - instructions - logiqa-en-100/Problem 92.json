Professor Zhao said? \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team.\" Professor Qian said ? \"The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China.\" Professor Sun said? \"The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team.The results of the competition showed that only one of them judged both, one 'S judgment is one-to-one wrong, the other one is wrong.\nQuestion: According to the above situation, we know that the winner is\nChoices:\n  A: Tsinghua University Team\n  B: China University of Science and Technology Team\n  C: Zhejiang University Team\n  D: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand each professor's statement.\n2. Consider the implications of each statement being true.\n3. Identify the constraints given in the problem (one fully correct, one half correct, one fully incorrect).\n4. Systematically consider each possibility of a professor being fully correct.\n5. For each possibility, check if the other professors' accuracy is consistent with the constraints.\n6. Eliminate possibilities that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.\n7. The remaining possibility that satisfies all constraints is the correct answer.\n"

Professor Sun says it's not USTC, but is Tsinghua.\nWe're told that exactly one professor is fully correct, one is half correct, and one is fully incorrect.\nLet's consider each possibility of a professor being fully correct:\n1. If Zhao is correct, then Qian and Sun must both be wrong (they both name a team Zhao excludes). But the problem states one of them is half right. Contradiction. So Zhao can't be the fully correct one.\n2. If Qian is correct, then the champion is USTC. This makes Zhao half correct (got one team right) and Sun fully incorrect. This is consistent with the problem constraints.\n3. If Sun is correct, then Qian must be fully wrong. But Zhao would also be fully wrong (he excludes Tsinghua). This contradicts the one fully correct, one half correct constraint. So Sun can't be the fully correct one.\nThe only possibility that fits the constraints is Qian being fully correct. Therefore, the champion must be the University of Science and Technology of China team.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
