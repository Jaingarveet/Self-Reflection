Read the question carefully and identify the key information.\n2. Consider all possible explanations for each robot's behavior.\n3. Eliminate robot types that are inconsistent with each robot's behavior.\n4. Don't jump to conclusions; consider all possibilities before deciding.\n5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the given information.\n"

So Robot 1 must be Type A.\n2. Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. This means it can recognize shape (balls) but not color. So Robot 2 must be Type B.\n3. We can eliminate choices A and B, because we know Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B, so they cannot both be Type C, nor can only one of them be Type C.\n4. Choice C directly matches our deductions - Robot 1 is Type A and Robot 2 is Type B. \n5. Choice D is the opposite of what we deduced. We determined Robot 1 is Type A (not B) and Robot 2 is Type B (not A).\nTherefore, the answer that logically follows from the given information is C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
