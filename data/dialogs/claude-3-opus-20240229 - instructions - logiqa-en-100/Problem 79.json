Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.\n2. Read through the original argument to grasp its main points and reasoning.\n3. Consider each answer choice in turn.\n4. For each choice, ask: Does this pose a challenge, doubt, or rebuttal to the original argument? Or does it support the argument?\n5. Eliminate the choices that do express doubts or rebuttals.\n6. The remaining choice should be the one that does not challenge the argument.\n7. Double check that your selected answer fits the question asked.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe original argument makes two main claims:\n1) There is an external world, as evidenced by our visual experiences of things like buildings, crowds, stars etc. \n2) Others have similar visual experiences, and books also tell us there is an external world.\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA: This challenges the argument by pointing out that using sensory evidence to prove the external world is circular reasoning - it presupposes what it's trying to prove. So this is a doubt/rebuttal.\nB: This questions how we can know others have similar experiences to us. It expresses skepticism about one of the premises of the argument. So this is also a doubt.\nC: This choice agrees with and supports the original argument. It says that since visual experience is reliable, things like mirages are real, not illusions. This fits with the argument's claim that our senses give us evidence of a real external world. So this is not a rebuttal.\nD: This poses a challenge to the argument. It asks, if there is no external world, how do we explain the success of science? It's suggesting the argument leads to a problematic conclusion. So this expresses doubt.\nLooking back at the question, it asked which choice does NOT constitute a doubt or rebuttal. \nThe only choice that supports rather than challenges the original argument is C.\nTherefore, C is the best answer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
