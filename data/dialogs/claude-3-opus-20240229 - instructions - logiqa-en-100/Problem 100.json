(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: If H is in Team 2, which of the listed arrangements is acceptable for Team 1?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N\n  B: Before? G In? K After? N\n  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G\n  D: Before? G Middle? K After?

Read the question carefully and note any given information.\n2. List out all the relevant conditions from the context.\n3. Eliminate the choices that clearly violate any of the conditions.\n4. For the remaining choices, methodically check each choice against each relevant condition.\n5. If a choice violates any condition, eliminate it.\n6.
