Read the given opinion carefully and identify its key points.\n2. Analyze each choice individually to determine its relationship to the opinion.\n3. Consider whether each choice supports, questions, or is neutral to the opinion.\n4. Identify the choice that does not allow the opinion to be questioned, i.e., the choice that supports the opinion.\n5. Double-check your reasoning for each choice to ensure accuracy.\n6. Select the choice that is the exception, i.e., the one that does not question the opinion.\n"

This suggests human factors beyond just climate are causing grassland degradation, questioning the opinion. \nB: Grasslands across the border in Mongolia are much healthier than in Inner Mongolia. This suggests factors other than climate, likely human-caused, are responsible for the degradation on the China side. This questions the opinion.\nC: Even in an uninhabited border area, grass maintains its 1950s height. This strongly suggests that when human interference is removed, the grasslands remain healthy despite any climate factors. This questions the opinion that the degradation is climate-caused and inevitable.\nD: This choice directly states that human factors like overgrazing are mainly responsible for the increase in dust storms. This questions the opinion that the storms are natural, climate-caused and inevitable.\nReflecting on the choices, A, B and C all provide evidence that human factors, not just climate, are responsible for the grassland degradation. D states this outright. \nTherefore, the choice that does not allow the stated opinion to be questioned is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
