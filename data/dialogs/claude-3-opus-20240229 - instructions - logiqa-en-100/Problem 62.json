Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking. Focus on the big picture, not just specific details.\n2. Analyze each answer choice and consider how it relates to the information and opinion presented in the question context. \n3. Look for choices that suggest alternative explanations or raise doubts about the completeness, logic or validity of the presented opinion.\n4. Be wary of choices that seem to contradict a specific detail but don't necessarily undermine the overall opinion.\n5. Select the choice that most directly challenges the key assumptions or conclusions of the opinion, or suggests the most compelling alternative explanation.\n"

This raises doubts about the completeness of the expert opinion.\nChoice C states the salamanders hide under rocks during the day, avoiding trampling. This directly challenges the assumption that grazing is the main cause.\nChoice D notes the salamanders are in an inaccessible mountainous area. This seems to contradict the idea tourists could impact them, but doesn't address the core opinion about grazing.\nReflecting on this, Choice C seems to raise the most doubt by suggesting the salamanders can avoid the proposed cause of their decline.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
