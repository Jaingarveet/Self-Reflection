The given information states:\n   - Only listed companies with dividends can issue new stocks\n   - If a company has a dividend, it does not need funds\n   - If a company needs financing, there is no way to pay dividends\n2. Now let's analyze each answer choice:\nA) \"A listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends.\"\n   This could be false. A listed company could need financing and not have dividends.\nB) \"A listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends.\"\n   This could be false. A listed company may not need financing and have dividends.\nC) \"A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends.\"\n   This statement cannot be false. If a listed company does not have dividends, it cannot issue new stocks based on the given information. And if it has dividends, it does not need funds and therefore does not need to issue new stocks.\nD) \"The only way for a listed company to finance is to issue new stocks.\"\n   This could be false. There may be other ways for a listed company to get financing besides issuing new stocks.\nTherefore, the answer that cannot be false is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
