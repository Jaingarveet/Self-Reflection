F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and the other three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?\nChoices:\n  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X\n  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y\n  C: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, Y, W\n  D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department?

Read the question carefully, noting whether it asks what \"must be\" true vs. what \"may be\" true.\n2. List out all given conditions.\n3. Consider each answer choice individually.\n4. For each choice, go through all conditions one by one.\n5. If a choice violates any condition, eliminate it.\n6. If a choice satisfies all conditions, it may be correct.\n7. The correct answer will be the choice(s) that remain after checking all conditions.\n"

H and Y must be in the same department \n2. F and G cannot be in the same department\n3. If X is in sales, W must be in production\n4. F must be in production\nNow let's check each choice against the conditions:\nChoice A: \nPublic Relations: W\nProduction: F, H, Y\nSales: G, I, X\nThis satisfies all conditions. F is in production, H and Y are together, F and G are separate, and with X in sales, W is in production. So this may be a valid distribution.\nChoice B:\nPublic Relations: W\nProduction: G, I, X \nSales: F, H, Y\nThis violates condition 4, as F must be in production but is in sales here. Eliminate.\nChoice C:\nPublic Relations: X\nProduction: F, G, H\nSales: I, Y, W\nThis violates condition 1, as H and Y are in different departments. Eliminate. \nChoice D:\nPublic Relations: X\nProduction: F, I, W\nSales: G, H, Y \nThis satisfies all conditions. F is in production, H and Y are together in sales, F and G are separate, and X being in PR doesn't violate the X/W condition. So this may also be a valid distribution.\nAfter checking all choices, A and D remain as possibly correct, satisfying all given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
