The administration department is above the planning department but below human resources.\n3. Human resources and sales cannot be on adjacent floors.\nWith those constraints, let's try to determine a possible arrangement, working from the bottom up:\n- Planning must be on a lower floor, with finance directly above it. \n- Administration is above planning but below HR, so it must go above finance.\n- HR and sales can't be adjacent. With admin between planning/finance and HR, the only place left for sales is the top floor.\n- That leaves one spot between HR and sales for R&D.\nSo a valid arrangement is:\n1. Planning \n2. Finance\n3. Administration \n4. Human Resources\n5. R&D\n6. Sales\nLooking at the answer choices, this matches choice B exactly.\nThe other choices all violate one or more of the given conditions. \nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
