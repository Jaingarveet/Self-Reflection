        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question describes a shift in focus for enterprises after joining the WTO. \n2. Initially, enterprises were focused on \"What should I do, what can I do to make money?\" This suggests their primary concern was profitability at an individual company level.\n3. After joining the WTO, the focus shifted to \"What can I do to be the best?\" This implies that rather than just profitability, being the best in the industry became the priority.\n4. The key phrase that characterizes this change is the transition from a company-centric view to an industry-wide perspective.\nNow let's evaluate each answer choice:\nA: \"The change of the problem means that the transition from the competition of the enterprise to the competition of the industry.\" \nThis directly captures the shift from an individual enterprise focus to an industry-wide competitive landscape. It explains the reason for the change in perspective.\nB: \"Only by being the best can companies make big money.\"\nWhile this may be true, it doesn't directly explain the reason for the change in question. It's more of an implication or result of the shift.\nC: \"Only in a profitable industry can we do our best.\"\nThis is not directly relevant to explaining the change. Industry profitability is a separate issue from the shift in competitive focus.\nD: \"What used to be good or bad in the industry is now only good or bad for enterprises.\" \nThis statement is a bit confusing and doesn't clearly explain the reason for the change in question from an enterprise view to an industry view.\nAfter analyzing each choice, A provides the most direct and complete explanation for the described change in perspective.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
