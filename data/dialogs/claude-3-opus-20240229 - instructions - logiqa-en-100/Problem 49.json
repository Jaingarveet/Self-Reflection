        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. \"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey\" means \"kidnapping student (host) hostage\"\n- \"Alingoits\" appears in another sentence meaning \"kidnapping\", so that is likely the meaning.\n- That leaves \"Doximayo\" and \"Makasey\" to mean either \"student\" or \"hostage\". We need more information to determine which is which.\n2. \"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs\" means \"hostage holding (see) reporter\"  \n- We see \"Makasey\" again, but still can't determine if it means \"hostage\" or \"reporter\".\n- \"Mugbudengs\" likely means \"reporter\" based on this sentence.\n3. \"Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits\" means \"kidnapping reporters away\"\n- This confirms \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter\" and \"Alingoits\" means \"kidnapping\".\n- By process of elimination, \"Doximayo\" must mean \"student\" and \"Makasey\" must mean \"hostage\".\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can deduce:\n- \"Alingoits\" means \"kidnapping\" \n- \"Doximayo\" means \"student\"\n- \"Makasey\" means \"hostage\"\n- \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter\"\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: \"Doximayo\" means \"hostage\" - Incorrect, it means \"student\"\nB: \"Doximayo\" means \"student\" - Correct\nC: \"Mugbudengs\" means \"kidnapping\" - Incorrect, it means \"reporter\"  \nD: I don't know what they mean - Incorrect, we were able to deduce the meanings\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
