Identify the logical structure of the original argument.\n2. Break down each answer choice to its core logical structure.\n3. Compare the structure of each answer choice to the original argument.\n4. Select the answer choice that most closely mirrors the original argument's structure.\n5. Double-check your selection to ensure it is the best match.\n"

The logical structure of the original argument is:\n   - All X have property Y \n   - Z does not have property Y\n   - Therefore, Z is not X\n2. Now let's examine the core logical structure of each answer choice:\n   A. P will have Q. R who is P will have Q. Therefore R is P.\n      This is affirming the consequent, a logical fallacy. Not the same structure.\n   B. X in Y are Z. A is not bought in Y. Therefore A is not Z. \n      This matches the original structure: All X in Y are Z, A is not in Y, therefore A is not Z.\n   C. X can Y. Z is X. Therefore Z can Y.\n      This is a valid syllogism, but not the same structure as the original.\n   D. Anyone who X can Y. Z did not Y. Therefore Z did not X.\n      This is the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Not the same structure.\n3. Comparing each choice's structure to the original, B is the clear match.\n4. B is the best match. Let's double-check:\n   - Original: All X are Y. Z is not Y. Therefore Z is not X.\n   - B: All X in Y are Z. A is not in Y. Therefore A is not Z.\n   The structures are identical, just with different variables.\n5. Therefore, B is definitively the best match to the original argument's structure.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
