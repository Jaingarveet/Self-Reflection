Implications:\n   - If we select E, we can't select F, and vice versa\n   - If we select J, we must select G, and can't select K\n   - If we don't select F, we can't select M\n3. Looking for combinations that uniquely determine the team:\n   - If we select G and J, that forces us to not select K (because of J) and not select F (because M isn't selected). So the team would have to be E, G, J, and either H or M.\n4. Checking each answer choice:\n   A) F and H - This allows E, G, J, K or M to be the other two. Not unique.\n   B) G and J - As discussed above, this forces the team to be E, G, J, and H or M. Two possibilities, so not fully unique.\n   C) G and M - This allows E or F, and J or K to be the other two. Not unique.\n   D) H and M - This forces F to be selected (because of M), which means E can't be. So the team would have to be F, H, M, and either J or K. Two possibilities, so not fully unique.\n5. None of the answer choices lead to a unique team composition. The correct answer must be \"None of the above\".\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")"
