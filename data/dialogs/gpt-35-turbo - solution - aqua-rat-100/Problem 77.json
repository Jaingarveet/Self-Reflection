The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 43 + 45 + [REDACTED] + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is [REDACTED] + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + [REDACTED] = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nChecking [REDACTED]. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, [REDACTED] cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n"
