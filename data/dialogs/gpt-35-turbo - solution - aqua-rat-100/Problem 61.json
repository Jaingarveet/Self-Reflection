Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?\nChoices:\n  A: 180\n  B: 90\n  C: 270\n  D: 360\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's call the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] \"d\".\nWe know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], and then at a constant speed of [REDACTED] mph from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED].\nWe also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching [REDACTED], only 70 miles away from it.\nLet's start by using the formula: distance = rate x time\nLet's call the time it took Kevin to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] \"t1\", and the time it took him to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] \"t2\".\nWe know that:\ndistance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = d\ndistance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = d\nrate from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = 70 mph\nrate from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] mph\ntime from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = t1\ntime from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = t2\nWe also know that:\ndistance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] - 70 = distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] + 70\nLet's use these equations to solve for d:\nd = 70t1\nd = [REDACTED]t2\nd - 70 = [REDACTED](t2 - 3)\nWe can use the first two equations to solve for t1 and t2 in terms of d:\nt1 = d/70\nt2 = d/[REDACTED]\nWe can substitute these expressions for t1 and t2 into the third equation:\nd - 70 = [REDACTED](d/[REDACTED] - 3)\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nd - 70 = d - [REDACTED]\nAdding 70 to both sides, we get:\nd = 340\nTherefore, the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] is 340 miles.\n"
