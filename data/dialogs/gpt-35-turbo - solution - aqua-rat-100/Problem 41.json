As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was\nChoices:\n  A: 8\n  B: 12\n  C: 16\n  D: 24\n  E: 25\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is \"x\".\nThe cost of eatables per person would be 96/x.\nWhen 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to pay an additional Rs. 4 each.\nSo, the new cost of eatables per person would be (96/(x-4)) + 4.\nWe can create an equation based on the above information and solve for \"x\".\nEquation: 96/x = (96/(x-4)) + 4\nSolving for \"x\":\n96/x - 96/(x-4) = 4\n(96(x-4) - 96x)/(x(x-4)) = 4\n-3[REDACTED]4/(x^2 - 4x) = 4\nx^2 - 4x = -96\nx^2 - 4x + 96 = 0\n(x-[REDACTED])(x-[REDACTED]) = 0\nx = [REDACTED] or x = [REDACTED]\nSince 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic must be less than or equal to [REDACTED].\nTherefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
