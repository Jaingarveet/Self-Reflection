        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy. During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's assume that Alex and Jacob made a toys and b toys respectively.\nThe time taken by Alex and Jacob to make a toys and b toys respectively can be calculated using the formula: Time = (Work / Rate)\nLet's assume that Alex worked for t hours and Jacob worked for (t + d) hours.\nUsing the above information, we can form two equations and solve for d.\nEquation 1: t/7 + (t + d)/9 = 35\nEquation 2: a + b = 35\nSolving equation 1 for t, we get t = (3[REDACTED] - 4d)/23\nSubstituting t in equation 2, we get a = (23*35 - 9d)/23 = 35 - (9d/23)\nSince both of them worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that the difference in their working hours is negligible. Therefore, we can assume that d is very small compared to 3[REDACTED]. \nUsing this approximation, we can solve for d as follows:\nt = (3[REDACTED] - 4d)/23 = (3[REDACTED]/23) - (4d/23)\nSubstituting this value of t in equation 1, we get:\n(3[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]1) - (4d/[REDACTED]1) + [(3[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]1) - (4d/[REDACTED]1) + d]/9 = 35/[REDACTED]1\nSimplifying the above equation, we get:\nd = [REDACTED]\nSubstituting d = [REDACTED] in the equation for a, we get:\na = 35 - (9d/23) = [REDACTED]\nTherefore, Jacob made 20 toys.\n"
