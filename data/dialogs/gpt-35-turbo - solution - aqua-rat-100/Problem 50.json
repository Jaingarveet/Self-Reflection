Find the distance when they meet from starting point.\nChoices:\n  A: 238\n  B: 289\n  C: 200\n  D: 287\n  E: 187\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's assume the speed of the ship is \"s\" and the time it takes to meet the plane is \"t\". \nThe distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is 180 miles.\nThe distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is 10s*t.\nThe total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented as s*t + 10s*t = 11s*t.\nThe distance traveled by the ship when they meet is s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: s*t = 180\nThe distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: 10s*t = 11s*t - 180\nSolving for t, we get t = 20.\nSubstituting t in the formula s*t = 180, we get s = 9.\nThe distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t = 10*9*20 = 1800.\nTherefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 1800 = 1980 miles.\nDividing 1980 by 10, we get 198.\n"
