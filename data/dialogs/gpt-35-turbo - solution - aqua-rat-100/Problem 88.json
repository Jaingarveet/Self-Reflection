After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\nChoices:\n  A: 10\n  B: 11.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 13.5\n  E: 15\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the total distance of the journey.\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = [REDACTED]0 x [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]00 miles\nWhen the train covers a quarter of the distance, it has traveled [REDACTED]00/4 = 250 miles.\nNow, the remaining distance is [REDACTED]00 - 250 = 750 miles.\nLet's calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75 = [REDACTED] hours\nWhen it starts raining, the train has already traveled for 250 miles at a speed of [REDACTED]0 miles/hour. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75 = [REDACTED] hours\nThe total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance, the time taken to cover the remaining distance, and the time taken during the rain.\nTotal journey duration = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] + 0.5 = 20.5 hours\n"
