I squared both sides of the equation without considering the possibility of introducing extraneous solutions.\n**Correct solution:**\n1. Square both sides of the equation:\n$$(\\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$$\n$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$\n2. Move all terms to one side:\n$$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$$\n3. Factor the quadratic:\n$$0 = (x-1)(x-9)$$\n4. Solve for x:\n$$x = 1 \\text{ or } x = 9$$\n**Analysis of the correct answer:**\n- Both solutions, x = 1 and x = 9, satisfy the original equation.\n- The solution x = 1 does not introduce an extraneous solution because it satisfies the original equation.\n- The solution x = 9 does not introduce an extraneous solution because it also satisfies the original equation.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct answer is **C: I and II**. Both solutions, x = 1 and x = 9, satisfy the given equation.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")"
