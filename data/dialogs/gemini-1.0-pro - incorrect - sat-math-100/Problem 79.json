        "content": "## Reflecting on the previous mistake:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misinterpreted the problem. I thought the helicopter was descending instead of ascending. This led me to choose the wrong function.\n## Analyzing the problem:\nThe helicopter is initially hovering at 40 feet and then starts ascending at a rate of 21 feet per second. This means that its altitude is increasing by 21 feet every second. We can represent this with the following equation:\n```\ny = 40 + 21t\n```\nwhere:\n* `y` is the helicopter's altitude in feet\n* `t` is the time in seconds since the helicopter started ascending\n* `40` is the initial altitude of the helicopter\n* `21` is the rate of ascent\n## Choosing the correct answer:\nThe equation that represents the helicopter's altitude is:\n```\ny = 40 + 21t\n```\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
