I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Step 1: Identify the key features of the equation.**\nThe equation is in the form of a quadratic function, specifically a vertical parabola. The coefficient of the leading term is negative, which means the parabola opens downwards. The vertex of the parabola is at the point $(3, a)$.\n**Step 2: Analyze the effect of the constant term.**\nThe constant term, $a$, shifts the entire parabola vertically. If $a$ is positive, the parabola is shifted upwards. If $a$ is negative, the parabola is shifted downwards.\n**Step 3: Determine the maximum or minimum point.**\nSince the parabola opens downwards, its vertex is the maximum point. Therefore, the maximum value of the function occurs at $(3, a)$.\n**Answer: D**\n**Reflection:**\nIn my previous attempt, I incorrectly identified the vertex as the minimum point. I have now corrected my understanding and provided the correct answer."
