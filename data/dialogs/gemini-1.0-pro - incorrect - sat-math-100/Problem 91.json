        "content": "Thought: \nThe function is linear, so it can be represented by an equation of the form $f(n) = mn + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\nWe can find the slope by taking the difference of any two outputs and dividing by the difference of the corresponding inputs. For example, using the first two rows of the table, we get: $m = \\frac{f(2) - f(1)}{2 - 1} = \\frac{1 - (-2)}{2 - 1} = 3$.\nWe can find the y-intercept by plugging in any point from the table and solving for $b$. For example, using the first row of the table, we get: $-2 = 3 \\cdot 1 + b$, so $b = -5$.\nTherefore, the equation of the function is $f(n) = 3n - 5$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
