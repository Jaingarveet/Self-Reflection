I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Step 1: Understanding the inequalities**\nThe first inequality, $y<-x+a$, represents the region below the line $y=-x+a$. The second inequality, $y>x+b$, represents the region above the line $y=x+b$.\n**Step 2: Finding the solution region**\nThe solution to the system of inequalities is the intersection of the two regions. Since $(0,0)$ is a solution, it must lie in this intersection.\n**Step 3: Analyzing the lines**\nThe line $y=-x+a$ has a slope of $-1$ and a y-intercept of $a$. The line $y=x+b$ has a slope of $1$ and a y-intercept of $b$.\n**Step 4: Determining the relationship between a and b**\nSince $(0,0)$ lies on both lines, we have the following equations:\n$$0=-0+a$$\n$$0=0+b$$\nSolving for $a$ and $b$, we get:\n$$a=0$$\n$$b=0$$\nTherefore, the relationship between $a$ and $b$ is $a=b$.\n**Answer: D**"
