The drill is likely part of a hurling practice or training session.\n\nIn this situation, the most likely completion to the text is that the boys will continue with the drill, forming lines and throwing the ball to each other. The text does not provide any information about what happens after the drill is complete, so I cannot accurately answer choice (D).\n\nI should have paid closer attention to the text and the context in which it was written to avoid misinterpreting it. I will make sure to be more careful in the future."
