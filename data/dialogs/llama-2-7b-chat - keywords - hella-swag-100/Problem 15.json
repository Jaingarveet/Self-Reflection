The text is actually describing the steps involved in making lemonade. The correct answer is (B) are filled with ice and poured afterwards. This is because the text states that \"steaming hot water is poured over the lemons in the glasses,\" which suggests that the lemons are being heated, and then the text mentions \"the glasses are stirred with a stirring rod,\" which implies that the mixture is being stirred. Finally, the text states that the glasses are \"poured afterwards,\" which confirms that the lemonade is being prepared.\n\nError Keywords: Misinterpretation, Contextual confusion, Incorrect assumptions.\n\nI hope this helps!
