After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the instructions. I mistakenly thought that the binary number was a decimal number and tried to convert it accordingly. However, the problem clearly states that in binary, 1 is \"on\" and 0 is \"off.\" Therefore, the correct way to decode the binary number is to assign a value to each digit based on its position from the right.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe binary number 1001001 can be decoded by assigning the following values:\n\n* Rightmost digit: 1 = 8\n* Second rightmost digit: 0 = 2\n* Third rightmost digit: 0 = 4\n* Fourth rightmost digit: 1 = 16\n* Fifth rightmost digit: 0 = 32\n* Leftmost digit: 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the decoded binary number is 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 62."
