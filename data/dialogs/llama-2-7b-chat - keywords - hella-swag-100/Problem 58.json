Craft paper typically comes in multiple shapes and colors, and if your craft paper has one shape, like blossoms, flowers, animals, and designs, choose an array to paint the dreidels on. This option best fits the context of the text, as it suggests selecting paper that is diverse and offers a variety of options for decorating the dreidels.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
