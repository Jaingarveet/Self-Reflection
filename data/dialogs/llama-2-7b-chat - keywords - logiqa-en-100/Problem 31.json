I selected option A, which states that the grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly in the 1950s, but now it can't even cover mice. However, this information is not relevant to the question. The question asks whether the opinions above can be questioned, and option A does not provide any evidence to support or challenge those opinions.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I will select option D, which states that the increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands. This option provides evidence that contradicts the opinions above, as it suggests that human activities are the primary cause of the dust storms, rather than natural disasters.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
