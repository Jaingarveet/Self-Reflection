My reasoning was as follows:\n\nI assumed that if Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, then Zhang Shan's bonus must be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's as well. However, this is not necessarily true.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe statement \"Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin's\" provides no information about the bonuses of Li Si and Zhang Shan. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's based on this statement alone.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, as this is the only assumption that allows us to conclude that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
