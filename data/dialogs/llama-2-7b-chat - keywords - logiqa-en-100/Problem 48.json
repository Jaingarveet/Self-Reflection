However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. The passage actually suggests that the volume of Chinese buyers has increased, not remained the same.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI realized that my previous answer was incorrect because I misread the passage. I overlooked the fact that the passage states that the transaction volume of Chinese buyers increased by 23% and 88% compared to the previous year. This suggests that the number of Chinese buyers is actually increasing, rather than remaining the same.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED (information not available)\n* INCREASE (volume of Chinese buyers)\n* SPECULATORS (groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese)"
