This suggests that the shocks were not invasive and did not cause significant pain to the subjects. Therefore, option A is not the best choice.\n\nOption B is the best choice because it explains how the micro-shocks in the brain could improve the brain's computing power. The passage states that the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced after the shocks, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations. This suggests that the enhancement in blood flow may have a lasting effect on the brain's computing power.\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I misunderstood the passage. I thought that the shocks were invasive and caused significant pain to the subjects, which led me to choose option A. However, upon further reading, I realized that the shocks were non-invasive and did not cause significant pain. Therefore, I changed my answer to option B."
