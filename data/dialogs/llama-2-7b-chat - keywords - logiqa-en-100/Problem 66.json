F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.\n2. I and E are adjacent.\n3. G is somewhere in the north of F.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the order of the islands from north to south is:\n\nF, G, E, I, H\n\nNow, let's count the number of possible arrangements for this group of islands:\n\nOption A: 2\nThis option suggests that there are only two possible arrangements for the islands. However, we have already determined that there are more than two possible arrangements.\n\nOption B: 3\nThis option suggests that there are three possible arrangements for the islands. However, we have already determined that there are more than three possible arrangements.\n\nOption C: 4\nThis option suggests that there are four possible arrangements for the islands. However, we have already determined that there are more than four possible arrangements.\n\nOption D: 5\nThis option suggests that there are five possible arrangements for the islands. However, we have already determined that there are more than five possible arrangements.\n\nConclusion:\nThe correct answer is (D) 5. There are five possible arrangements for the group of islands based on the given statements.\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nI reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my reasoning. I overlooked the information that G is somewhere in the north of F, which led me to conclude that there were only two possible arrangements. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and improve my answer."
