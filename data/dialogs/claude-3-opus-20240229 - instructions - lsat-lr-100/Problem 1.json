The key information is:\n   - It's difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate\n   - It's difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate  \n   - In most parts of the country, it's either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees\n2. For cacti to grow easily, it must not be humid. For orange trees to grow easily, it must not be cold.\n3. Let's consider each answer choice:\n   A: Half of the country is both humid and cold. \n      - This could be true. The information doesn't specify how much of the country is humid and cold.\n   B: Most of the country is hot.\n      - This could also be true. If most of the country is hot (and not humid), cacti would grow easily there, consistent with the information.\n   C: Some parts of the country are neither cold nor humid.\n      - This must be true. If it's easy to grow cacti or orange trees in most parts, there must be some parts that are neither cold nor humid.\n   D: It is not possible to raise cacti in the country.\n      - This is false. We're told in most parts it's easy to grow cacti or orange trees, so cacti can be grown in parts of the country.\n   E: Most parts of the country are humid.\n      - This must be false. If most parts were humid, it would be difficult to grow cacti in most parts, contradicting the given information.\n4. The answer that must be false is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
