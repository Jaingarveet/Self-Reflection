        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully, focusing on the key details and facts presented.\n2. Analyze each answer choice to determine if it is directly supported by the passage.\n3. Look for answer choices that can be logically inferred from the given information, even if not explicitly stated.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported or are only tangentially related.\n5. Select the answer choice that has the strongest and most direct support from the passage.\n"

If the allergy-causing proteins vary, and a particular cat doesn't necessarily affect all cat allergy sufferers, then it's reasonable to conclude no single cat will cause allergies in every person allergic to cats.\nThe other choices are not as strongly supported:\nA is contradicted, as the passage indicates it's the proteins, not cat breeds, that determine allergic reactions.\nC is possible but not directly stated.\nD is not mentioned at all.\nE is weakened by the varying proteins and reactions the passage describes.\nTherefore, B is the best answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
