The given information is:\n   - Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. \n   - This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\n3. Let's consider each answer choice:\nA. This statement could be true, but it's not necessarily true. The information given doesn't say anything about what portion of Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec.\nB. The information given doesn't say anything about what portion of all Canadian films produced this year were shown at Lac Nichoutec. This could be true but doesn't have to be.\nC. This must be true. If most of the prize-winners at Lac Nichoutec (which are all Canadian films) also won at international festivals, then some of the international prize-winners must have been Canadian.\nD. This could be true, but doesn't have to be. Even if most Lac Nichoutec prize-winners won internationally, it's possible that all of them were also shown internationally.\nE. This could be true, but doesn't have to be. The given information doesn't rule out the possibility that every single international prize-winner was shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n4. C is the only statement that must be true based solely on the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
