Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.\n2. Identify the facts provided in the argument.\n3. Determine what additional piece of information must be true for the conclusion to logically follow from the facts.\n4. Don't make assumptions beyond what is provided in the argument.\n5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or already stated in the argument.\n6. Choose the answer choice that, if false, would make the conclusion illogical or unsupported.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The conclusion is that once Acme moves to Ocean View, most employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\n2. The facts are:\n   - Acme is moving from Milltown to Ocean View\n   - Most employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View\n3. For the conclusion to follow, we must assume that currently, most employees do NOT have a 30+ minute commute. Otherwise, the move wouldn't change their commute situation.\n4. Let's examine each answer choice:\nA) This matches our needed assumption. If false, the conclusion wouldn't necessarily follow.\nB) The chairperson's reasons are irrelevant to the employees' commute times. \nC) Employee opinions are not mentioned and are irrelevant.\nD) This is the same as choice A, just phrased differently. It's the correct assumption.\nE) Pay raises are not mentioned. Even with a raise, the facts state employees can't afford closer housing.\n5. B, C, and E are not mentioned in the argument and are irrelevant. We can eliminate them.\n6. A and D both express the same necessary assumption, just phrased differently. If most employees already had 30+ minute commutes, then the conclusion about the effect of the move on their commutes would not follow.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. It expresses the unstated assumption that currently, most employees have less than a 30 minute commute, which is necessary for the conclusion to logically follow.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
