        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\nFacts from the passage:\n1. The museum displays only 20th century works\n2. The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection \n3. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store\n4. The store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA: This is false. The store sells prints of some works like Nighthawks that are not on loan or in the permanent collection. Eliminate A.\nB: This looks promising. The museum only displays 20th century works, and the store sells prints of works displayed in the museum (permanent collection) as well as some other works like Nighthawks. But Nighthawks is also a 20th century work. So this statement holds true. Keep B as a possibility.\nC: This is false. The store sells prints of all permanent collection works, but not necessarily all works on display (some are on loan). Eliminate C.\nD: This is not necessarily true. We don't know if Nighthawks is on loan to the museum. It may or may not be. Eliminate D.\nE: This is also not necessarily true. Nighthawks may or may not be displayed. The passage doesn't specify either way. Eliminate E.\nBy process of elimination, B is the only choice that must be true based on the information provided. Every print sold is of a 20th century work - either from the museum's collection or another 20th century work like Nighthawks.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
