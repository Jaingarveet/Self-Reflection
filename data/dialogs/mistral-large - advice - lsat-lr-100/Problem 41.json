However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.\nQuestion: The argument is flawed in that it\nChoices:\n  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory\n  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences\n  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing\n  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true\n  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your analysis and final answer.\n - Always identify the argument's assumption and evaluate its validity.\n - Always consider alternative possibilities and evaluate their relevance.\n - Always evaluate whether the argument's conclusion follows logically from its premises.\n - Always analyze the argument's structure and reasoning.\n - Always be aware of common logical fallacies and biases.\n"
