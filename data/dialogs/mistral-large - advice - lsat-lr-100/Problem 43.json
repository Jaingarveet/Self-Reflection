Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the conclusion, argument, and assumption in a logical argument.\n - Always think through the logical structure of the argument step-by-step.\n - Never focus solely on the subject matter of the argument; consider its logical structure.\n - Always double-check your understanding of the argument and the assumption required for the conclusion to follow.\n - Remember that the assumption required for a conclusion to follow logically may not be explicitly stated in the argument.\n"

        "content": "Reflection:\nIn my previous answer, I focused too much on the subject matter of the argument, which is about the meaning of \"love\" in marital vows. I incorrectly assumed that the ethicist's conclusion was based on the assumption that \"love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings. However, upon reflection, I realized that the ethicist's conclusion is not about the meaning of \"love\" but about the logicality of making a promise to do something that is not within one's control.\n\nThought:\nThe ethicist's argument is that a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Therefore, no one should take \"love\" in marital vows to be referring to feelings, as feelings are not within one's control. The assumption required for this conclusion to follow logically is that people should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
