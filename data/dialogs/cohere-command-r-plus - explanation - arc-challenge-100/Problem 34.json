After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?\nChoices:\n  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.\n  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.\n  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.\n  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the question and jumped to a conclusion. I focused on the phrase \"limited testing\" and assumed that the next logical step would be to expand the testing to humans. However, the question asks for a way to \"strengthen their conclusions,\" implying that the focus should be on the validity and reproducibility of the existing results rather than immediate expansion to human trials.\n"

Jumping to human trials is premature and not the most direct way to address the validity of the initial findings. Instead, the researchers should seek independent retesting to validate their results and ensure reproducibility, thereby strengthening their conclusions before moving forward.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
