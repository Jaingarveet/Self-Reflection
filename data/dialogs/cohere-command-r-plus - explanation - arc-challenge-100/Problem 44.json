When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?\nChoices:\n  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.\n  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.\n  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.\n  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the concept of forces influencing the car and how they relate to its speed. My error was in interpreting the force of gravity as the primary factor influencing the car's speed change when it transitioned to a flat surface.\n"
