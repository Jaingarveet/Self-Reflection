Instead, the correct answer is \"hunting skills,\" as this is something that animals learn and perfect over time, rather than an innate instinct.\n\nThought: Instincts are innate behaviors that animals are born with and do not need to learn. Migrating, hibernating, and building nests are all examples of animal instincts as they are performed naturally without prior learning. Hunting skills, however, are learned and refined through practice and experience, and so this is not an example of an instinct.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
