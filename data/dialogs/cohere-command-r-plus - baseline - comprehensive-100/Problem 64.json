So, the population after one year is $95\\%=0.95$ of the original population.\n\nTherefore, the population after $t$ years is $50,000(0.95)^t$\n\nNow, we need to express this in terms of 20 years. So, $t=\\frac{1}{20}*20t=0.05*20t$\n\nSubstituting, we get the population after $t$ years is $50,000(0.95)^{0.05*20t}=50,000(0.95^{20t})^0.05=50,000(0.9975)^{20t}$\n\nSo, the final answer is $50,000(0.9975)^{20t}$, which can be written as $50,000(0.9975^5)^{4t}$, and $(0.9975)^5\\approx0.95$\n\nTherefore, the expression that best represents the engineer's estimate is $50,000(0.95)^{4t}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
