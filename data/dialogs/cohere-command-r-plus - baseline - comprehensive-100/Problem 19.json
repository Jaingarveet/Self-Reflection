Choice B is also incorrect because it does not address the fallacy and introduces a new conditional statement. Choice C is irrelevant to the logical structure of the argument. Choice D is correct because it recognizes that the individual statements may be true or false, but together they lead to an invalid conclusion.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
