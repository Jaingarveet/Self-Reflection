This means that they must visit Lake G to satisfy statement (1). \n\nStatement (2) tells us that if the team does not go to either City E or City F, then they cannot go to Lake G. Therefore, the team must have gone to either City E or City F (or both). \n\nStatement (3) tells us that if the team did not go to City E, then they cannot go to Mountain H. \n\nCombining these statements, we can deduce that the team must have gone to City F, and from there, they could have chosen to go to either Lake G, Mountain H, or both. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the group went to F City, and they could have gone to either G Lake, H Mountain, or both, but they did not go to J Lake.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
