Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n"

The two restaurants are separated by the veterinarian and toy store, which is more than two businesses. The pharmacy is next to the optometrist, and the toy store is not next to the veterinarian.\n\nChoice B: This arrangement violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, as they are only separated by the shoe store.\n\nChoice C: This arrangement is invalid because the pharmacy is not at one end of the row and it doesn't fulfill the requirement of having a restaurant at the other end.\n\nChoice D: This arrangement violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, as it is separated from both by the toy store and the second restaurant.\n\nChoice E: This arrangement places the pharmacy and restaurant at either end, meeting the first constraint. The restaurants are adequately separated, and the pharmacy is next to the optometrist. Finally, the toy store is not next to the veterinarian.\n\nTherefore, only choice A and choice E satisfy all the constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"A,E\")"
