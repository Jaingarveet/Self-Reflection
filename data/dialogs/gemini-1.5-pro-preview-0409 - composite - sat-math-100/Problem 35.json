This oversight led me to include an extraneous solution.\nError Keywords:\n - Extraneous solution\n - Verification error\n - Squaring both sides\nSolution:\n1. **Solve for $x$ by squaring both sides:**\n$(\\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$\n$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$\n$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$\n$0 = (x-1)(x-9)$\nTherefore, $x=1$ or $x=9$.\n2. **Check for extraneous solutions:**\n- For $x=1$: $\\sqrt{4(1)} = 2$, but $1-3 = -2$. So, $x=1$ is not a valid solution.\n- For $x=9$: $\\sqrt{4(9)} = 6$, and $9-3 = 6$. So, $x=9$ is a valid solution.\nInstructions:\n1. Solve the equation algebraically, keeping in mind that squaring both sides might introduce extraneous solutions.\n2. Once you have potential solutions, substitute each one back into the original equation.\n3. Verify if the equation holds true for each potential solution.\n4. Discard any solution that does not satisfy the original equation.\n5. Select the answer choice that includes only the valid solutions.\nAdvice:\n- Always be cautious when squaring both sides of an equation, as it can introduce extraneous solutions.\n- Always check your solutions by substituting them back into the original equation to ensure they are valid. \n- Remember that extraneous solutions may satisfy the derived equation but not the original one.\n"
