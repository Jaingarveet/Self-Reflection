Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation: \nI incorrectly recalled the source of antisera, confusing it with another type of antibody often used in research. My mistake was in the specific detail of the source animal, a common challenge in the vast field of medicine. \n\nError Keywords: \n- Recall error\n- Confusion\n- Source confusion\n\nSolution: \nAntisera, a heterologous serum containing antibodies, is obtained from horses. Horses are large animals and can provide a substantial volume of serum, making them a suitable source for antisera production. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific biological product in question: antisera.\n2. Recall that antisera is a heterologous serum, which indicates its source.\n3. Understand that antisera is often obtained from large animals to yield sufficient quantities.\n4. Recall that horses are a common source of heterologous serum.\n5. Choose the answer option that reflects this knowledge: \"D.\" \n\nAdvice: \n - Ensure a strong foundational understanding of medical concepts. \n - Focus on understanding the underlying principles and patterns rather than rote memorization. \n - Develop a systematic approach to problem-solving, breaking down complex topics into manageable chunks. \n - Regularly review and organize your knowledge to facilitate accurate recall. \n - Stay cautious and avoid overgeneralization or jumping to conclusions. \n - When in doubt, take a step back and re-evaluate the fundamental concepts."
