Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Understand the nature of cicatricial pemphigoid as an autoimmune disease.\n2. Recognize that the question seeks the antigen targeted by IgG autoantibodies.\n3. Identify collagen XVII as the transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome.\n4. Confirm that collagen XVII is located on the epidermal side of the dermal-epidermal junction.\n5. Select the answer choice corresponding to collagen XVII.\nAdvice:\n- Familiarize yourself with the common antigens targeted in autoimmune diseases.\n- Understand the structural components of the dermal-epidermal junction, including collagen XVII and its role.\n- Be mindful of potential confusion between different types of laminin and their respective locations and functions.\n- When answering multiple-choice questions, ensure your answer choice directly addresses the specific aspect being queried."
