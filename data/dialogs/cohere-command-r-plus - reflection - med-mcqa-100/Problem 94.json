Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Understand the question: Identify the fungal infection known as Gilchrist's disease.\n2. Recognize associated nicknames: Be aware that certain conditions may have multiple names or associated nicknames.\n3. Prioritize primary associations: When dealing with medical terminology, prioritize the primary associations over less common or less specific ones.\n4. Cross-reference differentials: While differentials are important, prioritize the primary condition when a term has a strong association with a specific disease entity.\n5. Trust explicit associations: When a term is explicitly linked to a condition, as in this case, trust that association over more distant or less explicit connections.\n\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context: Recognize that certain medical terms have strong associations with specific conditions and that these associations are important in the medical field.\n- Prioritize primary connections: When dealing with medical terminology, always prioritize the primary associations first and then consider differentials or less common connections.\n- Cross-reference differentials cautiously: While it's important to consider differentials, be cautious about selecting them when a term has a strong, explicit association with a specific condition.\n- Trust explicit medical links: Trust the explicit links between medical terms and conditions; they are often established for a reason and are widely recognized in the medical community."
