        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term \"proverb\" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, \"Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are.\" Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly implied by the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners, then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition.\n  B: The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.\n  C: The ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.\n  D: There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.\n  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I focused too much on the specific examples of proverb usage in Mexican American communities and their connection to ethnic identity. I failed to recognize the broader statement about the nature of proverbs and their dependence on context for meaning.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Overemphasis on specifics\n*   Ignoring broader context\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the strongest implication, meaning something that is suggested but not directly stated.\n2.  **Review the passage:** Look for statements that apply to proverbs in general, not just in the context of Mexican American culture.\n3.  **Identify relevant information:** The passage defines proverbs as self-contained sayings understood independently of a specific verbal context but whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and social context.\n4.  **Match information to answer choices:** Option D directly reflects this information about proverbs requiring no verbal context but having meaning dependent on the social context of use.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Read the question carefully:** Understand what it is asking for (e.g., main idea, implication, inference).\n2.  **Identify the scope of the question:** Is it asking about a specific example or a general principle?\n3.  **Review the passage with the question in mind:** Focus on information relevant to the question's scope.\n4.  **Evaluate each answer choice:** Eliminate options that are contradicted by the passage or are too specific.\n5.  **Choose the answer that best reflects the passage's overall message or the specific information asked for.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Avoid focusing too much on specific examples:** Look for broader principles or implications.\n*   **Consider the context of the passage:** Understand the main topic and purpose.\n*   **Pay attention to keywords and phrases:** They often signal important information.\n*   **Read all answer choices before making a decision:** Eliminate obviously wrong options first.\n*   **Practice active reading and critical thinking skills:** This will improve your ability to understand and analyze complex texts.\n"
