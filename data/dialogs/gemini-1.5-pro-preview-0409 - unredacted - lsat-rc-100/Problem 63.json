        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, \"El Corrido de Kiansis\" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: \"I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me.\" Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including \"Kiansis,\" which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of \"Gregorio Cortez\" is translated as follows: \"Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez.\" The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.\nQuestion: The author discusses metaphor in the second paragraph primarily in order to\nChoices:\n  A: elaborate on a claim about the directness of the\n  B: language used in corridos counter the commonplace assertion that narrative is the main object of corridos\n  C: emphasize the centrality of poetic language to corridos\n  D: point out the longevity of the corrido tradition\n  E: identify an element common to all variants of a particular corrido\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the broader implication of using familiar imagery in metaphors, which is to strengthen the corrido tradition over time. However, the question specifically asks about the primary purpose of discussing metaphors within the context of the second paragraph. The main point being made is that despite the direct and simple language of corridos, metaphors do exist, but they utilize everyday imagery to maintain that directness and connect with the audience.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation of question scope \n* Focus on broader implication instead of primary purpose\n* Overlooking context\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Reread the question:**  Focus on understanding what the question is specifically asking.  Here, it's about the author's primary purpose in discussing metaphors, not the overall impact of metaphors on the corrido tradition.\n2. **Review the relevant paragraph:**  Identify the main points being made about metaphors. The passage highlights the rarity of metaphors and emphasizes their use of familiar imagery.\n3. **Analyze the connection:**  Connect the use of familiar imagery to the overall characteristic of corridos. The passage emphasizes the directness and simplicity of language in corridos.\n4. **Choose the best answer:**  Select the option that aligns with the primary purpose identified. Option A, \"elaborate on a claim about the directness of the language used in corridos,\" accurately reflects this purpose. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1. **Carefully analyze the question:**  Identify the specific focus and scope of the question. \n2. **Pay close attention to context:**  Consider the surrounding information and the specific paragraph or section referenced.\n3. **Identify the author's purpose:**  Determine the main point the author is trying to convey in the discussed section.\n4. **Connect the evidence to the purpose:**  Analyze how the discussed element (e.g., metaphors) supports the author's main point.\n5. **Eliminate answer choices:**  Rule out options that are outside the scope of the question or contradict the text.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Read actively and critically:**  Engage with the text to understand the author's intent and argument.\n* **Focus on the specific details:**  Pay attention to the nuances of language and the context of information.\n* **Avoid making assumptions:**  Base your answer on the information provided in the passage, not on external knowledge or personal opinions.\n* **Practice active reading strategies:**  Highlight key points, take notes, and summarize information to improve comprehension.\n"
