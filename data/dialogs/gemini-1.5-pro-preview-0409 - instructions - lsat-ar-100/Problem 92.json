Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

I focused too much on the either/or conditions for Tiao and Udall without fully considering the implications of the other constraints, particularly the one stating \"Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\" This oversight led me to an incorrect conclusion.\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Parra and Quinn are a pair:** We know they must be together, so we can treat them as a single unit for placement purposes.\n2. **Stuckey and Udall are another pair:** Similar to Parra and Quinn, they must also be placed together.\n3. **Zone 3 has the most representatives:** This means at least 3 people must be in Zone 3.\n4. **Tiao's placement options:** \n    * **If Tiao is in Zone 1:** Then Udall must be in Zone 2 (due to the either/or condition). This leaves only one spot in Zone 2 and forces both pairs (Parra/Quinn and Stuckey/Udall) into Zone 3. This satisfies all conditions.\n    * **If Tiao is in Zone 2:** Then Parra must be in Zone 1 (due to the either/or condition). This leaves no space for Quinn in Zone 1 as they must be together. This creates a contradiction, so Tiao cannot be in Zone 2.\n## Conclusion:\nSince Tiao cannot be in Zone 2 and must be with either Parra or Udall, the only option is for Tiao to be with Parra. This means Quinn, who is always with Parra, also cannot be with Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
