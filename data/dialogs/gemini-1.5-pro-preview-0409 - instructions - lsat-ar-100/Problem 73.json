The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

This led me to overlook a crucial detail or misinterpret a constraint.\n**Key Learnings:**\n1. **Holistic Approach:** I need to consider all constraints and conditions simultaneously, not just focus on individual pieces of information.\n2. **Pairing Students:** The \"exactly two students review the same play or plays\" condition is crucial and should guide my reasoning.\n3. **Elimination:**  I should actively eliminate options that violate the given conditions.\n**Improved Strategy:**\n1. **Start with the fixed information:** Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez.\n2. **Analyze the \"Undulation\" constraint:** Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, one of them must also review Undulation.\n3. **Pair the remaining students:**  Identify which two students share the same plays based on the remaining constraints.\n4. **Evaluate each option against the established scenario.** \n**Applying the Improved Strategy:**\nLet's analyze the options based on the learnings and the given context: \n"
