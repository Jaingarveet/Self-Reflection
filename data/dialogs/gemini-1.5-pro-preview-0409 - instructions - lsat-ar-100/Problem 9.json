Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual rules and not enough on the combined implications of those rules and the specific condition presented in the question (Young having a higher-numbered space than Souza). This led me to overlook a possible scenario that satisfied all conditions.\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Young > Souza:** This means Young cannot have space #1 or #2, as Souza would then need a lower number which is impossible.\n2. **Robertson > Young:** This means Robertson must have a higher number than Young, and consequently, a higher number than Souza.\n3. **Robertson's options:** Given rule 4, Robertson can only have spaces #3 or #4.\n4. **Analyzing options:**\n    - **A:** If Togowa has space #1, then Young and Souza must have #2 and #3 (or #3 and #4) which violates rule 3 (Robertson > Young). So, A is not possible.\n    - **B:** If Young has space #2, then Souza needs space #1, violating rule 3 (Robertson > Young). So, B is not possible.\n    - **C:** If Robertson has space #3, then Young and Souza can have spaces #1 and #2, satisfying all rules. So, C is possible.\n    - **D:** If Souza has space #3, then Young needs a higher number, but then Robertson cannot have a higher number than Young within the allowed spaces. So, D is not possible.\n    - **E:**  This option doesn't provide enough information to determine validity. We don't know the positions of Young, Souza, and Robertson relative to Vaughn.\nTherefore, the only option that could be true is C.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
