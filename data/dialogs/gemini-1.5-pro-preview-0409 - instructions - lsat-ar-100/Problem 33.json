This led me to overlook a scenario that violated one or more of the constraints.\n**Understanding the Constraints:**\n1. **French Works Limit:** Maximum of 4 French works (novels + plays).\n2. **Novels Range:** Minimum of 3 and maximum of 4 novels (French + Russian).\n3. **French/Russian Novel Ratio:** At least as many French novels as Russian novels.\n4. **French Plays & Russian Play:** If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be.\n**Approach for This Attempt:**\nI will carefully analyze each option, ensuring it satisfies ALL of the above conditions before considering it a possibility. If even one condition is violated, the option will be deemed impossible and thus the answer to the question. \n"
