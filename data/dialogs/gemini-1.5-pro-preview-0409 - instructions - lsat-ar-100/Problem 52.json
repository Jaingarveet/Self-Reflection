This led me to a wrong conclusion.\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Iturbe and Jackson testify on Wednesday:** This leaves three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong) for Monday and Tuesday.\n2. **Exactly two witnesses on Tuesday:** This means only one witness can testify on Monday. \n3. **Hong not on Monday:** Since only one witness testifies on Monday and it can't be Hong, it must be either Franco or Garcia.\n4. **Franco not with Garcia:** This constraint becomes irrelevant as they cannot both be on Monday due to point 2.\nTherefore, the only certainty is that **exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday**. \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
