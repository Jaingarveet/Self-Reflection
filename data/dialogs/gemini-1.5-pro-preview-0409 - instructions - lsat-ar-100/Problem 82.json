Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

I need to carefully consider each condition and ensure the final arrangement satisfies all of them.  Specifically, I should pay close attention to the conditions related to:\n* **Parra and Tiao:** Only one of them can be in Zone 1.\n* **Tiao and Udall:** Only one of them can be in Zone 2.\n* **Parra and Quinn:** They must be in the same zone.\n* **Stuckey and Udall:** They must be in the same zone.\n* **Zone 3 population:** It must have more representatives than Zone 2.\n## Analyzing the Choices:\n**A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao**\n* This option satisfies the conditions for Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall. \n* However, it violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) should be in Zone 1. \n**B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn**\n* This option satisfies all the conditions:\n    * Parra and Quinn are together.\n    * Stuckey and Udall are together.\n    * Only Tiao is in Zone 1 and not Parra.\n    * Only Udall is in Zone 2 and not Tiao.\n    * Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.\n**C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao**\n* This option violates the condition that Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone.\n**D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn**\n* This option violates multiple conditions:\n    * Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 1.\n    * Tiao cannot be in Zone 2 if Udall is there.\n**E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall**\n* This option violates the condition that Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone as each other.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, only option B satisfies all the given conditions. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
