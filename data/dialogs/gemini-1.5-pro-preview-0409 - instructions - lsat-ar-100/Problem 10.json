This can be more efficient, especially with complex constraints.\n**Applying Learnings to the Current Problem:**\n1. **Number of Works:**  The selection must have at least 5 and at most 6 works.\n2. **French Works Limit:**  There can be a maximum of 4 French works.\n3. **Novels Range:**  The selection needs 3 or 4 novels.\n4. **French/Russian Novels Ratio:**  The number of French novels must be equal to or greater than the number of Russian novels.\n5. **Plays Condition:**  If both French plays are chosen, the Russian play cannot be included.\nI will use these conditions to analyze each option and eliminate those that violate any of the requirements. \n"
