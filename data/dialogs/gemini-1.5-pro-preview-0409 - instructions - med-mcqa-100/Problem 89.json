I overlooked the specific details of the question, which asked for the investigation that is NOT useful. \nAnalysis of the Correct Answer:\nThe correct answer is Anteroposterior X-ray. While AP X-rays can provide some information about the alignment of the spine, they are not as helpful as lateral view X-rays in visualizing the slippage of one vertebra over another, which is the hallmark of spondylolisthesis. \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
