The correct answer is B: 60 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid.\nI made the mistake because I confused the recommended daily dosage of iron and folic acid for pregnant women under the MCH program with the dosage for treating iron-deficiency anemia. While 100 mg of iron might be prescribed for anemia treatment, the preventive measure for pregnant women under the MCH program recommends a lower daily dosage of 60 mg iron along with 500 mcg of folic acid.\nI have learned that it's crucial to pay close attention to the specific context of the question, especially when dealing with dosages and recommendations for different medical situations. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
