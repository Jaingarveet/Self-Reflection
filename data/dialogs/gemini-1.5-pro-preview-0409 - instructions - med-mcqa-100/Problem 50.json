The inferior mesenteric vein actually drains into the splenic vein, which then joins the superior mesenteric vein to form the hepatic portal vein. The hepatic portal vein carries blood to the liver for processing before it returns to the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins, which empty into the inferior vena cava. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
