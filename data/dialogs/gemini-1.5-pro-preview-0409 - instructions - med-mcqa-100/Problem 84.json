This demonstrates a gap in my knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms of action for different classes of glaucoma medications.\n**Solution:** I have reviewed the pharmacology of glaucoma medications, focusing on their impact on aqueous humor dynamics. I now understand that:\n* **Beta-blockers (e.g., Timolol):** Reduce aqueous humor production.\n* **Miotics (e.g., Pilocarpine):** Increase outflow through the trabecular meshwork by contracting the ciliary muscle and opening the drainage angle.\n* **Alpha-2 agonists (e.g., Brimonidine):** Reduce aqueous humor production and increase uveoscleral outflow.\n* **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., Brinzolamide):** Reduce aqueous humor production.\n**Correct Answer:** Based on this understanding, the medication that affects the trabecular meshwork and aqueous outflow is a **miotic**.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
