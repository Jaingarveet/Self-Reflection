However, I failed to consider the specific details of the case, such as the patient being a multigravida with previous normal deliveries. This information suggests that factors like placenta previa and uterine anomalies are less likely. \nInstead, I should have focused on factors that can cause unstable lie in a multigravida with a history of normal deliveries. Oligohydramnios, or low amniotic fluid, is a more likely cause in this scenario as it reduces the space for the fetus to move and settle into a stable position.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
