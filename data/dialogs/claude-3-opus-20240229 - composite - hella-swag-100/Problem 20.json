He catches waves but wipes out early on most of them. a bird\nChoices:\n  A: starts to play on the shore.\n  B: walks over onto the screen to watch.\n  C: flies after him and shows him diving off a rock.\n  D: appears to divebomb into the ocean.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose the answer that seemed most mundane and ordinary, rather than considering the dramatic and eye-catching possibilities. While birds walking on the beach are common, the phrasing \"a bird appears to divebomb into the ocean\" suggests a surprising and notable visual that would fit well in an action-oriented surfing video. I was thinking too literally and not imaginatively enough about what would make for compelling video content.\nError Keywords:\n- Lack of imagination \n- Overly literal thinking\n- Ignoring context clues\n- Favoring mundane over dramatic\nSolution:\nThe video cuts to the beach and the man begins to surf. He catches waves but wipes out early on most of them. The video is likely showing his failed attempts for dramatic/comedic effect. In this context, a surprising visual like a bird divebombing into the ocean would be an eye-catching way to punctuate the scene and add to the action-oriented feel, even if it's not literally related to the surfing. The phrasing \"appears to divebomb\" also suggests a quick cut of dramatic imagery, which fits the video editing style, as opposed to a mundane shot of a bird on the shore.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and imagine the scene described vividly in your mind.\n2. Look for any context clues about the style and tone of the content (e.g. an action-oriented surfing video).\n3. Consider each of the answer choices and visualize how they would play out on screen.\n4. Favor dramatic, surprising, or eye-catching visuals over mundane ones, if they fit the context.\n5. Select the answer choice that would make for the most compelling and well-edited video content, while still being plausible given the setup.\nAdvice:\n- Don't just go for the most literally probable answer - consider what would be dramatically satisfying or visually striking for the audience.\n- Use context clues to infer the intended style and tone of the content.\n- Visualize each choice playing out and evaluate which would be the most compelling on screen.\n- When it comes to video, favor dynamic action and striking imagery over mundane realism.\n- [REDACTED] surprising visual tangent can add punch to a scene, even if it's not literally related to the main action.\n"
