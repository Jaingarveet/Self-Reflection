        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week. His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline. Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\frac{25}{4} m=95$\n  B: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\n  C: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\n  D: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misunderstood the question and incorrectly set up the equation. I calculated the number of miles Alan should reduce instead of setting up an equation to find the number of miles. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation of the question\n- Incorrect equation setup\nSolution:\nAlan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. \nSince his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon, the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week is 4/25 * m = 5, where m is the number of miles less he should drive each week.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question and what is being asked.\n2. Identify the given values: cost of gasoline, miles per gallon, and the amount Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by.\n3. Calculate the number of gallons less Alan should use each week by dividing the amount he wants to reduce his expenditure by the cost of gasoline.\n4. Set up the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week. The equation should be (cost of gasoline / miles per gallon) * m = amount Alan wants to reduce his expenditure by.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Identify the given values and what you need to find.\n- Set up the equation correctly based on the given values and what you need to find.\n- Double-check your equation to ensure it is set up correctly.\n"
