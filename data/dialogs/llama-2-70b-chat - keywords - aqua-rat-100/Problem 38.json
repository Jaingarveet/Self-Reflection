        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe question asks about the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. To find this, we need to subtract the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are painted from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes.\nThe total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 6*6*6=216.\nThe number of faces of the smaller cubes that are painted is the surface area of the hollow cube. Since the thickness of the cube is 1cm, the surface area of each face of the hollow cube is 5cm*5cm=25cm^2. Therefore, the total surface area of the hollow cube is 6*25cm^2=150cm^2.\nNow, we need to subtract the surface area of the hollow cube from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes to find the number of unpainted faces: 216-150=66.\nTherefore, the answer is 66.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") 498"
