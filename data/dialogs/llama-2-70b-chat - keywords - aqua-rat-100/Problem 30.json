Here's my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:\n\nThe question asks how long it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets if he takes one tablet every 15 minutes. To calculate this, we need to divide the total number of tablets by the time taken to consume one tablet. In this case, we have 5 tablets, and the time taken to consume one tablet is 15 minutes. Therefore, the total time taken to consume all 5 tablets will be:\n\n5 tablets / 15 minutes per tablet = 90 minutes\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 90 minutes.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and I apologize again for my previous mistake."
