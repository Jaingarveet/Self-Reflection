I made an error in my previous answer by assuming that each book must have a unique code, which led me to choose option D: 10.\n\nHowever, upon reflection, I realized that the question only states that each type of book must be uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters. It does not specify that each book must have a unique code.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 5. Amy can use a single letter to represent 5 different types of books, and a pair of letters to represent the remaining 5 types of books, for a total of 10 different codes.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
