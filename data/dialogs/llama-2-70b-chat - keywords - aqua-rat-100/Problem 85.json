Let's analyze the problem again.\nIf I walk 20 steps and stop, I reach the bottom in 10 minutes, which means the elevator moves 2 steps per minute.\nIf I walk 10 steps and stop, I reach the ground in 20 minutes, which means the elevator moves 0.5 steps per minute.\nThe speed of the elevator is not the average of these two speeds, as the elevator's speed is not constant. Instead, we can find the speed of the elevator by finding the common denominator of the two speeds: 2 steps/minute and 0.5 steps/minute.\nThe least common multiple of 2 and 0.5 is 10, so we can convert both speeds to 10 steps/minute.\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps/minute, which corresponds to choice C: 3 step/minute.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
