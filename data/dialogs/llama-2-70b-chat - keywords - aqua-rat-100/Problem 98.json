Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe formula for calculating simple interest is:\nSimple Interest = Principal x Rate x Time\n\nIn this case, the principal (P) is Rs. 500, the rate (R) is 6% per annum, and the time (T) is 4 years.\n\nNow, let's calculate the simple interest:\nSimple Interest = 500 x 6% x 4 = 1200\n\nNow, we add the simple interest to the principal to get the total amount that Rahul needs to pay to clear the debt:\nTotal Amount = Principal + Simple Interest = 500 + 1200 = 1700\n\nThe correct answer is option A: 750.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
