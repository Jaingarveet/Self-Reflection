We also know that 90% of the rest (which means 90% of the 90% that are not cocoa flavored) are squashed.\n3. Therefore, the number of chocolates that are not squashed and not cocoa flavored can be calculated as follows:\n\n90% of the chocolates are not cocoa flavored (i.e., 90% x 100% = 9000%)\n90% of the remaining 90% are squashed (i.e., 90% x 90% = 81%)\nThe percentage of chocolates that are not squashed and not cocoa flavored is 100% - 81% = 19%\n\nSo, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 19%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
