Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe question states that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour.\nSo, if he sells each bag for $100, the cost price of each bag is $100 / (1 + 0.25) = $80.\nThe profit made by selling one bag is $100 - $80 = $20.\nThe total profit made by selling x bags is x * $20 = $20x.\nThe question states that the total profit made by selling x bags is $3,000.\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n$20x = $3,000\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\nx = $3,000 / $20\nx = 150\n\nSo, the grocer sold 150 bags of flour.\nThe correct answer is B: 16.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
