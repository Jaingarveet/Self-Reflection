        "content": "  My apologies for my previous response. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my mistake was in the reasoning process. I misapplied the concept of angle bisectors.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can draw a line from point B to the center of the circle, which will bisect the minor arc AC.\n\nUsing the properties of angle bisectors, we can say that:\n\n* Angle BAC = Angle BDA\n* Angle BAD = Angle BCD\n\nWe know that Angle BAC = 160° and Angle BCD = 150°. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\n* Angle BAD = 150° - 160° = -10°\n\nSince minor arc AD is the sum of Angle BAD and Angle BDA, we have:\n\n* Minor arc AD = Angle BAD + Angle BDA = -10° + 160° = 150°\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further mistake."
