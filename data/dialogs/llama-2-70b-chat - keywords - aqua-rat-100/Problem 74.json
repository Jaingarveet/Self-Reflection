I misunderstood the question and incorrectly interpreted the concept of \"different\" quadrilaterals.\n\nTo find the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we need to consider the following:\n\n* The number of ways to choose 4 points from 6 points (A, B, C, D, E, and F)\n* The number of ways to form a quadrilateral with 4 points\n\nThere are 6C4 ways to choose 4 points from 6 points:\n\n6C4 = 15\n\nNow, we need to find the number of ways to form a quadrilateral with 4 points. We can form a quadrilateral by joining any 4 points in a cycle. There are 4! ways to arrange 4 points in a cycle:\n\n4! = 24\n\nHowever, we need to divide this number by 4, since we don't want to count the orientation of the quadrilateral.\n\n24/4 = 6\n\nTherefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is:\n\n15 x 6 = 90\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
