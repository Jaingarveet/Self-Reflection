        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:\nJack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for Rs. 100.\nIf he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners, then the cost of a white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of a brown sharpener.\nLet the cost of a brown sharpener be x.\nThen, the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1.\nThe total cost of 18 sharpeners is Rs. 100.\nSo, we can set up the equation:\nx + (x + 1) + 18 = 100\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n2x + 18 = 100\n\nSubtracting 18 from both sides:\n2x = 82\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\nx = 41\n\nNow, we know that the cost of a brown sharpener is Rs. 41, and the cost of a white sharpener is Rs. 41 + 1 = Rs. 42.\n\nSo, Jack bought 9 brown sharpeners (since 9 x 41 = 369, which is less than 100) and 9 white sharpeners (since 9 x 42 = 378, which is greater than 100).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 9,8.\n\nI made a mistake in my previous answer by misunderstanding the problem and using an incorrect equation. I reflected on my mistake and corrected my solution to arrive at the correct answer."
