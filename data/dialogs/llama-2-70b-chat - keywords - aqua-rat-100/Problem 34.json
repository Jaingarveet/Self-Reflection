Let's break down the problem step by step:\nThe cost price of the book = Rs. 27.50\nThe selling price of the book = Rs. 25.75\nThe difference between the selling price and cost price = Rs. 27.50 - Rs. 25.75 = Rs. 1.75\nThe percentage profit or loss = (difference / cost price) x 100\n\nNow, we need to find the percentage profit or loss if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75.\n(1.75 / 27.50) x 100 = 6.36%\nSince the percentage is positive, it's a profit.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous response, I made a calculation error. I mistakenly calculated the percentage profit/loss as (1.75 / 25.75) x 100, which led to an incorrect answer. This time, I ensured that I calculated the percentage correctly by dividing the difference by the cost price, not the selling price."
