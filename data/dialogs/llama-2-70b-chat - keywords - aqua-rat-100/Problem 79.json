Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.\n3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.\n\nWe can start by finding the amount each nephew receives. Let's say each nephew receives x.\n\nEach daughter receives 4x, and each son receives 5x.\n\nThe total amount of money distributed among the daughters and sons is:\n4x + 5x = 9x\n\nSince there are 4 daughters and 5 sons, the total amount distributed among them is:\n9x = 8600\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx = 955\n\nSo, each daughter receives 4x = 4 \\* 955 = 3820.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
