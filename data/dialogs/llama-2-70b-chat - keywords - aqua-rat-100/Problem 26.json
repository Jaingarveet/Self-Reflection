Let's break down the problem step by step:\nA wire in the shape of a rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm.\nTo find the side length of the square it must be bent into, we need to find the diagonal of the rectangle.\nThe formula for the diagonal of a rectangle is:\nDiagonal = sqrt((Length^2) + (Width^2))\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\nDiagonal = sqrt((27^2) + (17^2))\nDiagonal = sqrt(729 + 289)\nDiagonal = sqrt(1018)\nDiagonal = 31 cm\n\nNow, since the wire is bent into a square, all sides of the square must be equal.\nTherefore, each side of the square will be 31 cm.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") 31 cm.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question and calculated the area of the rectangle instead of finding the length of the diagonal. I also made a calculation error. This time, I took my time to read the question carefully and used the correct formula to find the length of the diagonal, which gave me the correct answer."
