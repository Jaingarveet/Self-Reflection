Let's reflect on the question and the correct answer.\nThe question states that the man saves 12 1/2% of his income, which means he spends 87 1/2% of his income.\nThe amount he spends is given as Rs. 3500.\nTo find his monthly income, we can set up the following equation:\nIncome = 3500 / (1 - 0.125)\n= 3500 / 0.875\n= 4000\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: Rs. 4000.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
