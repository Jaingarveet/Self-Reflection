        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe question asks for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges.\nThis is a classic problem of combinations.\nThe formula for combinations is:\nn! / (k! \\* (n-k)!)\n\nIn this case, n = 10 (the total number of oranges)\nk = 2 (the number of oranges we want to choose)\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n10! = 10 \\* 9 \\* 8 \\* 7 \\* 6 \\* 5 \\* 4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1 = 3,628,800\n\n2! = 2 \\* 1 = 2\n\n(10 - 2)! = 8 \\* 7 \\* 6 \\* 5 \\* 4 \\* 3 \\* 2 \\* 1 = 3,628,800\n\nNow, we can apply the multiplication principle:\nThe number of ways to choose 2 oranges = 10! / (2! \\* (10-2)!)\n= 3,628,800 / (2 \\* 3,628,800)\n= 180\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: 180.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
