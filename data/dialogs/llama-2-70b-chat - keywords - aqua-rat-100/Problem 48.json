Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. 24% of all Daifu students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n2. 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce that 24% of the students are members of the swim team (since they are also members of the chess club). Now, 20% of the swim team members are not members of the chess club, so we need to subtract that percentage from the total swim team members.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\n24% - 20% = 4%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 4%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
