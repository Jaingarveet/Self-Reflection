I made a counting error in my previous answer.\nLet's reflect on the problem:\nWe need to arrange 3 children (Susan, Tim, and Zen) on 3 identical chairs in a straight line so that Susan is on the left of Tim.\nWe can arrange the children in 3! = 6 ways:\n1. Susan, Tim, Zen\n2. Susan, Zen, Tim\n3. Tim, Susan, Zen\n4. Tim, Zen, Susan\n5. Zen, Susan, Tim\n6. Zen, Tim, Susan\n\nSince we want Susan to be on the left of Tim, we can eliminate the arrangements where Tim is on the left of Susan (i.e., arrangements 3, 4, and 6).\nTherefore, the correct answer is 6 - 3 = 3.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
