Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days.\n3. Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\n4. Mr. Blue will complete the contract.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of days Mr. Brown and Mr. Black worked together:\n8 days - 6 days = 2 days\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract:\n12 days - 2 days = 10 days\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
