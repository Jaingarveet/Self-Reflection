Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe volume of the rectangular solid is 3 x 4 x 15 = 180.\nThe volume of the sphere is (4/3) \\* π \\* r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.\nSince the solid is inscribed in the sphere, the radius of the sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the solid, which is √(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = √(9 + 16 + 225) = √240.\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the sphere:\n(4/3) \\* π \\* (√240)^3 = 4/3 \\* π \\* 240 = 272.\nSo, the diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, which is 2 \\* √240 = 480.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
