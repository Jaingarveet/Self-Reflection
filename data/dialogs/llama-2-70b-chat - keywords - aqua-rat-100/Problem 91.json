I realize that I misunderstood the problem and incorrectly applied the Pythagorean theorem.\nTo solve this problem, we need to use vector addition.\nA starts at a point and travels 3 km south, so the vector from the starting point to A's new position is (-3, 0).\nThen, A travels 5 km east, so the vector from A's new position to B is (0, 5).\nNext, A travels 3 km north, so the vector from B to C is (0, -3).\nFinally, A travels 2 km west, so the vector from C to D is (-2, 0).\nWe can add these vectors using the tip-to-tail method:\n(-3, 0) + (0, 5) + (0, -3) + (-2, 0) = (-5, -3)\nThe magnitude of this vector is √((-5)^2 + (-3)^2) = √(25 + 9) = √34 km\nTherefore, A is 34 km away from home.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
