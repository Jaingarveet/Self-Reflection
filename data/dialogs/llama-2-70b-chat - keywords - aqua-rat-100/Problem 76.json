        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the question again.\nThe given expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4) can be simplified as follows:\n\nx = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\nx = (n2 + 2n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4)\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)\n\nNow, we can see that the numerator and denominator have a common factor of n + 4, which cancels out:\n\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n + 4)\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 16 - 4n - 4) / (n + 4 - 4)\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 12) / n + 4 - 4\nx = (n2 + 2n2 + 8n + 12) / n\n\nSince n is between 36 and 72, n is always positive. Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is always positive:\n\nn2 + 2n2 + 8n + 12 > 0\n\nSo, x is always positive, and we can conclude that:\n\n20 < x < 54\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
