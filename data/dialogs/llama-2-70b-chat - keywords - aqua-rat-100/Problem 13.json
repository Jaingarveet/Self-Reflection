Let's break down the problem step by step:\nA student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.\nThe question is asking for the value of 7/8 of a number, but the student mistakenly found the value of 7/18. To find the correct answer, we need to find the number that, when multiplied by 7/18, gives a result that is 770 away from the actual value of 7/8 of that number.\nLet's call the number x. Then, we can write:\n7/8 x = (7/18) x + 770\nWe can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 8:\n7x = 13(7/18) x + 770(8)\n7x = 13(7/18) x + 6160\nSubtracting 13(7/18) x from both sides gives us:\n6x = 6160 - 13(7/18) x\nSimplifying further, we get:\n6x = 6160 - 13(7/18) x\n6x = 6160 - 13(1/18) x\n6x = 6160 - 13x/18\n6x = 6160 - 13x/18\n\nNow, we need to find the value of x that makes the expression 6x equal to 6160. We can do this by setting up a proportion:\n6x = 6160\nx = 6160/6\nx = 1026.67\nSince we are looking for a whole number, we can round up to 1027.\nTherefore, the number that the student should have found is 1027.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
