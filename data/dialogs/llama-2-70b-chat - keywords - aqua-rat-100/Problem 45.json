I realize that I misunderstood the question and confused profit and discount.\nTo find the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount, we need to first find 20% of the cost price, which is Rs. 1200 x 20% = Rs. 240.\nThen, we add the profit to the cost price: Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 = Rs. 1440.\nFinally, we find 20% of the selling price and subtract it from the selling price to get the discounted price: Rs. 1440 x 20% = Rs. 288.\nTherefore, the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount is Rs. 1440 - Rs. 288 = Rs. 1152.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
