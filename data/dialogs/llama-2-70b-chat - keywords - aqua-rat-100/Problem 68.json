The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\nThe correct answer is C: 352.\n\nMy previous answer was A: 242, which is incorrect.\nThe error in my previous answer was a calculation error. I mistakenly calculated the least common multiple of 11 and 350 as 242 instead of 7700.\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, we need to find the other integer that has a greatest common factor of 11 with 350 and has a least common multiple of 7700.\nWe can start by factoring 350: 350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7.\nThe greatest common factor of 350 and 11 is 11.\nThe least common multiple of 11 and 350 is 7700.\nTherefore, the other integer is 352 (11 x 32).\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
