        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My focus on the variability of allergic reactions led me to overlook the more direct statement about the cause – the differing proteins in cats. Option B, while related, is more of an implication of the varying proteins rather than a direct statement about them.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Focus on implication over direct cause\n*   Overlooking key information\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify the central theme:** The passage focuses on the variability of allergens (proteins) in cats and the resulting individual allergic responses.\n2.  **Analyze each option:**\n    *   A: This is not supported as the passage doesn't discuss breed-specific allergens.\n    *   B: This is an implication of the varying proteins but not a direct statement about them.\n    *   **C: This directly addresses the core point – cats differ in their protein composition.**\n    *   D: The passage doesn't compare the intensity of allergic reactions.\n    *   E: While predictability is complex, the passage doesn't explicitly make this claim.\n3.  **Choose the best option:** Option C aligns most directly with the passage's main point about the variability of proteins in cats. \n## Future Instructions\n1.  **Identify the main point of the passage.**\n2.  **Focus on direct statements and causes rather than implications or correlations.**\n3.  **Analyze each option in relation to the passage's central theme.**\n4.  **Eliminate options that are not directly supported or are irrelevant.**\n5.  **Choose the option that best reflects the passage's main point.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Read the passage carefully and identify the key points and supporting details.**\n*   **Pay attention to the specific wording of the question and options.**\n*   **Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not directly supported by the passage.**\n*   **Consider all options before making a final decision.**\n*   **Practice actively analyzing passages and answering questions to improve comprehension and critical thinking skills.**\n"
