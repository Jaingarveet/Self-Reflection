Children need to learn the consequences of being bad. Yoko: Children's stories still tend to have clearly immoral characters in them, but now these characters tend not to be the sort that frighten children. Surely that's an improvement.\nQuestion: Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories\nChoices:\n  A: should be less frightening than they are\n  B: tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were\n  C: differ significantly in overall quality from earlier children's stories\n  D: tend to have clearly immoral characters in them\n  E: should help children learn the consequences of being bad\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the nature of Peter and Yoko's disagreement. I focused on the aspect of fear and the shift in portrayal of immoral characters, overlooking the core disagreement about the presence of such characters in modern stories.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation \n* Comprehension error\n* Focus on detail \n* Missing the main point\n## Solving the Problem\n1. **Identify the core argument of each person:** Peter argues for the necessity of immoral characters, while Yoko acknowledges their presence but highlights a change in their portrayal.\n2. **Analyze the disagreement:** The central point of contention is whether modern children's stories \"tend to have clearly immoral characters\" (Option D). \n3. **Eliminate irrelevant options:** Options A, B, and C discuss the level of fear, overall quality, and the purpose of teaching consequences, which are not the main points of disagreement.\n4. **Choose the correct option:** Option D accurately reflects the central disagreement between Peter and Yoko.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1. **Carefully read and understand the context of the conversation.**\n2. **Identify the main argument of each speaker.**\n3. **Pinpoint the specific point of disagreement.**\n4. **Eliminate options that address irrelevant aspects of the conversation.**\n5. **Choose the option that directly reflects the core disagreement.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Focus on the main points of the conversation, not just specific details.**\n* **Pay attention to keywords and phrases that indicate the speakers' positions.**\n* **Consider the context and purpose of the conversation.**\n* **Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not supported by the text.**\n* **Practice active reading and comprehension skills.**\n"
