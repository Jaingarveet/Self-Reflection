This can be seen from the fact that those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit in that they strive to develop commercially viable technology.\nQuestion: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it\nChoices:\n  A: contains a premise that cannot possibly be true\n  B: takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable\n  C: fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain\n  D: takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome\n  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the assumption that commercially viable technology cannot benefit society. While this assumption is flawed, it is not the main weakness of the argument. The core issue lies in the argument's presumption that actions not explicitly motivated by societal benefit cannot lead to such benefits.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on secondary issue\n*   Ignoring core assumption\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** Technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society.\n2.  **Identify the Premise:** Individuals responsible for technological advancements are motivated by personal gain, not societal benefit.\n3.  **Analyze the Gap:** The argument assumes that actions motivated by personal gain cannot result in societal benefits. This is a flawed assumption because actions can have unintended positive consequences.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Identify the conclusion and premises of the argument.**\n2.  **Analyze the logical connection between the premises and the conclusion.**\n3.  **Identify any assumptions made in the argument.**\n4.  **Evaluate the validity of the assumptions and their impact on the argument's strength.**\n5.  **Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples that weaken the argument.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Focus on the structure of the argument and the logical connections between premises and conclusions.**\n*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies, such as assuming the consequent or confusing correlation with causation.**\n*   **Consider the possibility of unintended consequences and indirect effects of actions.**\n*   **Don't get distracted by secondary issues or flawed assumptions that are not central to the argument's main weakness.**\n"
