On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from focusing on the specific example of inconsistency presented (education spending) rather than the general principle of consistency in political policy. I failed to recognize that the editorial's argument hinges on the idea that a consistent policy wouldn't advocate against actions that achieve worthy goals.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of argument\n*   Focus on specific example instead of general principle\n*   Failure to identify underlying assumption\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Identify the conclusion:** The editorial concludes that the political party's policy is inconsistent.\n2.  **Analyze the reasoning:** The reasoning is based on the party supporting both increased and decreased spending on education.\n3.  **Identify the assumption:** The argument assumes that a consistent policy wouldn't advocate against actions (reducing spending) that achieve worthy goals (improving education). \n4.  **Match the assumption to the answer choice:** Choice D accurately reflects this assumption.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the conclusion and reasoning of the argument.**\n2.  **Look for the underlying assumption that bridges the reasoning to the conclusion.**\n3.  **Consider alternative assumptions and why they might be flawed.**\n4.  **Choose the answer choice that best reflects the most likely assumption.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Focus on the general principles and assumptions underlying arguments, not just the specific examples provided.**\n*   **Consider different interpretations of the argument and identify the assumptions that support each interpretation.**\n*   **Think critically about the validity and implications of the assumptions.** \n*   **Practice identifying assumptions in various types of arguments.**\n"
