After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\nChoices:\n  A: 7\n  B: 8\n  C: 10\n  D: 11\n  E: 12\n\nThought:\nLet's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.\nMr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.\nMr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house in a day.\nMr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house in a day.\nAfter 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.\nNow, Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the work.\nTogether, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed (4/3 + 3/4) = 7/3 of the work.\nThus, the remaining work is (1 - 7/3) = 2/3 of the work.\nLet's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.\nSo, in x days, Mr.Blue can complete (1/12)*x of the work.\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n(1/12)*x = 2/3\nx = (2/3)/(1/12)\nx = 8\nTherefore, it will take Mr.Blue 8 days to complete the contract.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
