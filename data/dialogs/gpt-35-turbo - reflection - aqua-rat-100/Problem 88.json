I added the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance, but I forgot to add the time taken during the rain. \nError Keywords:\n - Addition error\n - Calculation error\n - Time calculation error\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the total distance of the journey.\nDistance = Speed x Time\nDistance = 100 x 10 = 1000 miles\nWhen the train covers a quarter of the distance, it has traveled 1000/4 = 250 miles.\nNow, the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles.\nLet's calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75 = 10 hours\nWhen it starts raining, the train has already traveled for 250 miles at a speed of 100 miles/hour. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75 = 10 hours\nThe total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance, the time taken to cover the remaining distance, and the time taken during the rain.\nTotal journey duration = 10 + 10 + 0.5 = 20.5 hours\nInstructions:\n1.
