The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, 41 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 44. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, 44 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 47. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, 47 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 67. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + 67 = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, 67 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nLet's check 91. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, 91 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nAnswer: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
