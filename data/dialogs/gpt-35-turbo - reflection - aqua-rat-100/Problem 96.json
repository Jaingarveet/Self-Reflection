Identify the investments of each person and the duration of their investments.\n2. Use the ratio of their investments to calculate the share of profit for each person.\n3. Add up their shares of the profit to get the total profit.\n4. Set up an equation using the total profit and the sum of their shares of the profit.\n5.

Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct ratio of investments to calculate the share of profit for each person.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the sum of their shares of the profit should be equal to 1."
