If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator?\nChoices:\n  A: 1 step/minute\n  B: 2 step/minute\n  C: 3 step/minute\n  D: 4 step/minute\n  E: None of the above\n\nThought:\nLet's assume that the speed of the elevator is \"x steps/minute\".\nFrom the first statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 20 steps. So, the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (20 steps)/(10 minutes) = 2 steps/minute.\nFrom the second statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 10 steps. So, the time taken to reach the ground is 20 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (10 steps)/(20 minutes) = 0.5 steps/minute.\nSince we have two different values for the speed of the elevator, we can conclude that the elevator is not moving at a constant speed. Therefore, the answer is E: None of the above.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
