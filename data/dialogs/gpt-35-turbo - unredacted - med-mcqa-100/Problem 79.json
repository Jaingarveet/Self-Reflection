Identify the average growth rate of children.\n2. Identify the number of years.\n3. Multiply the average growth rate by the number of years.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula to solve the problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that multiplication is the result of adding a number to itself a certain number of times.\n"
