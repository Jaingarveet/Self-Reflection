The correct answer is A. \nIron deficiency anemia is diagnosed based on laboratory findings. The most sensitive and specific tests for iron deficiency anemia are decreased serum ferritin and increased TIBC. The transferrin ferritin index is calculated by dividing TIBC by serum ferritin. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of laboratory findings\n - Lack of knowledge of laboratory tests\n - Misunderstanding of the relationship between TIBC and serum ferritin\nSolution:\nIron deficiency anemia is diagnosed based on laboratory findings. The most sensitive and specific tests for iron deficiency anemia are decreased serum ferritin and increased TIBC. The transferrin ferritin index is calculated by dividing TIBC by serum ferritin. \nAnswer choice A is the correct answer because it includes both decreased serum ferritin and increased TIBC, which are the most sensitive and specific tests for iron deficiency anemia. \nInstructions:\n1. Identify the laboratory tests used to diagnose iron deficiency anemia.\n2. Understand the relationship between TIBC and serum ferritin.\n3. Identify the laboratory findings that are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.\n4. Read each answer choice carefully and compare it to the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia.\n5. Choose the answer choice that includes the laboratory findings that are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.\n6. Double-check your answer to ensure that it matches the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always review the diagnostic criteria for the condition being tested.\n - Always review the laboratory tests used to diagnose the condition being tested.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it matches the diagnostic criteria for the condition being tested.\n - Remember that laboratory findings are the most sensitive and specific tests for diagnosing many medical conditions.\n"
