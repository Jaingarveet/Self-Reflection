Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the amino acids listed in the answer choices.\n3. Recall which amino acids require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.\n4. Identify the amino acid that does not require aminoacyl t-RNA for protein synthesis.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your identified amino acid.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always recall the basic concepts and definitions related to the question.\n - Always be specific in your knowledge and understanding of the topic.\n - Never assume that you know the answer without checking your knowledge.\n - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n"
