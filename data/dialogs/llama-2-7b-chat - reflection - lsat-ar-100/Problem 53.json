        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown in the evening.\n  B: L is shown in the afternoon.\n  C: L is shown in the evening.\n  D: M is shown in the morning.\n  E: M is shown in the afternoon.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:\n\n1. J must be shown in the evening.\n2. K cannot be shown in the morning.\n3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n\n* K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n* L must be shown after K is shown, so it cannot be shown in the morning. It can be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n* M must be shown after L is shown, so it cannot be shown in the morning. It can be shown in the afternoon or evening.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: K is shown in the evening.\nThis choice is not possible because K cannot be shown in the morning.\n\nB: L is shown in the afternoon.\nThis choice is not possible because L must be shown after K is shown, and K is shown in the evening.\n\nC: L is shown in the evening.\nThis choice is possible because L must be shown in the evening, and K is shown in the evening.\n\nD: M is shown in the morning.\nThis choice is not possible because M must be shown after L is shown, and L is shown in the evening.\n\nE: M is shown in the afternoon.\nThis choice is not possible because M must be shown after L is shown, and L is shown in the evening.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C): L is shown in the evening.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
