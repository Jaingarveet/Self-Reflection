        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the given conditions to determine which statement is false.\n\n1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nAction: Let's evaluate each statement:\n\nA. Image's website target is 1 day. (False, as Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Image's voicemail target is 2 days, which is longer than its website target of 1 day.)\n\nB. Solide's website target is 2 days. (True, as Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, which is shorter than Solide's website target of 2 days.)\n\nC. Solide's voicemail target is 2 days. (False, as Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, which is longer than Solide's website target of 2 days.)\n\nD. Truvest's website target is 2 days. (False, as Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, which is shorter than Truvest's website target of 2 days.)\n\nE. Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days. (True, as Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, which is shorter than Truvest's website target of 2 days.)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Solide's website target is 2 days.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
