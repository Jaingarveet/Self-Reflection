Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Landon\n  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Novetzke\n\n  Thought: To determine the possible combinations of ambassadors assigned to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia, we need to apply the constraints given in the problem.\n\n1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the possible combinations of ambassadors based on the constraints:\n\nA. Jaramillo and Landon: This combination violates constraint 3 as Ong is assigned to Venezuela and Landon is not assigned to Yemen.\n\nB. Jaramillo and Novetzke: This combination violates constraint 1 as Novetzke is assigned to one of the ambassadorships and Kayne is not.\n\nC. Kayne and Landon: This combination violates constraint 3 as Ong is assigned to Venezuela and Kayne is assigned to Yemen.\n\nD. Kayne and Novetzke: This combination violates constraint 1 as Novetzke is assigned to one of the ambassadorships and Kayne is not.\n\nE. Landon and Novetzke: This combination violates constraint 4 as Landon is assigned to Zambia and Novetzke is assigned to one of the other ambassadorships.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (E) Landon and Novetzke.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
