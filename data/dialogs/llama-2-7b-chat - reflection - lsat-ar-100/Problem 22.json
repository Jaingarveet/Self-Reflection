Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either\nChoices:\n  A: F or else K\n  B: F or else M\n  C: K or else M\n  D: M or else Q\n  E: P or else Q\n\n  Thought: To determine the panel composition based on the given conditions, we need to use a systematic approach. Let's use a truth table to keep track of the possible combinations of scientists selected.\n\n| Botanist | Chemist | Zoologist | Panel Composition |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | K | P | F, K, P |\n| F | L | P | F, L, P |\n| F | M | P | F, M, P |\n| G | K | P | G, K, P |\n| G | L | P | G, L, P |\n| G | M | P | G, M, P |\n| H | K | P | H, K, P |\n| H | L | P | H, L, P |\n| H | M | P | H, M, P |\n| K | L | Q | K, L, Q |\n| K | M | Q | K, M, Q |\n| M | L | Q | M, L, Q |\n| M | R | Q | M, R, Q |\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nOption A: If both G and H are selected, the panel must include either F or K.\n\nReason: If G and H are selected, then at most one botanist can be selected (since there are only two botanists). Therefore, the panel must include either F or K, since they are the only two botanists left.\n\nOption B: If both F and K are selected, the panel must include either F or M.\n\nReason: If F and K are selected, then there are only two chemists left (L and M). Therefore, the panel must include either F or M, since they are the only two chemists left.\n\nOption C: If K and M are selected, the panel must include either K or M.\n\nReason: If K and M are selected, then there are only two zoologists left (P and R). Therefore, the panel must include either K or M, since they are the only two zoologists left.\n\nOption D: If M is selected, the panel must include either M or Q.\n\nReason: If M is selected, then there are only two zoologists left (P and R). Therefore, the panel must include either M or Q, since they are the only two zoologists left.\n\nOption E: If P is selected, the panel must include either P or Q.\n\nReason: If P is selected, then there are only two zoologists left (P and R). Therefore, the panel must include either P or Q, since they are the only two zoologists left.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: If both F and K are selected, the panel must include either F or M.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
