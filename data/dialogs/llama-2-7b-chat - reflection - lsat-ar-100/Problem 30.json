        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the conditions given in the question:\n\n1. The third solo is a traditional piece.\n2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\n3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.\n4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.\n5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Wayne performs the first solo and Zara performs the second solo.\n\nIn this scenario, the third solo must be a traditional piece, as the condition states. And since Zara performs the second solo, she cannot perform the fifth solo. Therefore, the answer is (B) Zara performs the third solo.\n\nScenario 2: Zara performs the first solo and Wayne performs the second solo.\n\nIn this scenario, the third solo must be a traditional piece, as the condition states. And since Wayne performs the second solo, he cannot perform the fifth solo. Therefore, the answer is (B) Zara performs the third solo.\n\nScenario 3: Wayne performs the first solo and Zara performs the fifth solo.\n\nIn this scenario, the third solo is not a traditional piece, as the condition states. And since Zara performs the fifth solo, she cannot perform the third solo. Therefore, the answer is (D) The second solo is a traditional piece.\n\nScenario 4: Zara performs the first solo and Wayne performs the fourth solo.\n\nIn this scenario, the third solo is not a traditional piece, as the condition states. And since Wayne performs the fourth solo, he cannot perform the fifth solo. Therefore, the answer is (E) The fourth solo is a modern piece.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (B) Zara performs the third solo.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
