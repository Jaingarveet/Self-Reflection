Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\n\n  Thought: Based on the constraints provided, we need to determine which business can be located in each space.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the options:\n\nA) The optometrist cannot be in space 2 because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and the optometrist is not at the other end.\nB) The pharmacy cannot be in space 7 because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and the pharmacy is already located at one end of the row.\nC) A restaurant cannot be in space 4 because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and space 4 is between the pharmacy and one of the restaurants.\nD) The shoe store cannot be in space 6 because the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and space 6 is between the toy store and the veterinarian.\nE) The toy store cannot be in space 3 because the veterinarian is in space 5, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The toy store is in space 3.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
