Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\n\n  Thought: Based on the given conditions, we need to determine which students review Tamerlane.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the information given in the question:\n\n1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can conclude that:\n\n* Kramer and O'Neill are the only two students who review Tamerlane.\n* Jiang does not review Tamerlane.\n* Lopez does not review Tamerlane.\n* Megregian reviews at least one play that Kramer and Lopez do not review.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of students who review Tamerlane:\n\n1. Kramer and O'Neill: This is the only combination that satisfies all the conditions.\n2. Kramer and Lopez: This combination does not satisfy condition 3, as Lopez reviews more plays than Kramer.\n3. Kramer and Megregian: This combination does not satisfy condition 2, as Megregian does not review any play that Kramer reviews.\n4. O'Neill and Megregian: This combination does not satisfy condition 1, as O'Neill does not review Tamerlane.\n5. Lopez and Megregian: This combination does not satisfy condition 2, as Lopez reviews more plays than Megregian.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
