Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is second\n  B: H is second.\n  C: S is second\n  D: R is third.\n  E: Y is third\n\n  Thought: Based on the conditions provided, we need to determine which article could be second.\n\nG: J must be earlier than G, so G cannot be second.\nH: B cannot be true since H is not earlier than G.\nS: C cannot be true since S must be earlier than Y.\nR: D cannot be true since R must be earlier than G.\nY: E cannot be true since Y is not earlier than S.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
