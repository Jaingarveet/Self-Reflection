The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of houses that CANNOT be shown consecutively in either order?\nChoices:\n  A: J, K\n  B: J, M\n  C: J, O\n  D: J, P\n  E: M, P\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:\n\n1. J must be shown in the evening.\n2. K cannot be shown in the morning.\n3. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of houses that can be shown consecutively:\n\n1. J, K - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening.\n2. J, M - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because M must be shown after L is shown, and L must be shown before M.\n3. J, O - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because O cannot be shown in the afternoon.\n4. J, P - This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order because P must be shown after J is shown, and J must be shown in the evening.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: J, K - Incorrect. This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\nB: J, M - Incorrect. This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\nC: J, O - Incorrect. This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\nD: J, P - Incorrect. This combination cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\nE: M, P - Incorrect.

After analyzing the information given in the question, we can conclude that the only pair of houses that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is J and K.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they cannot be shown consecutively in either order:\n\nB: J and M cannot be shown consecutively in either order because M must be shown after L is shown, and L must be shown before M.\n\nC: J and O cannot be shown consecutively in either order because O cannot be shown in the afternoon.\n\nD: J and P cannot be shown consecutively in either order because P must be shown after J is shown, and J must be shown in the evening.\n\nE: M and P can be shown consecutively in either order, so this is not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order."
