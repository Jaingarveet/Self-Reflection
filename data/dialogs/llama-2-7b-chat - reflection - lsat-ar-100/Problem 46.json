Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.\n  B: Seamus tests F on the first day.\n  C: Theresa tests F on the second day.\n  D: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests F on the second day.\n\n  Thought: Based on the conditions given in the problem, we need to determine which statement cannot be true.\n\nLet's analyze each choice:\n\nA: Reynaldo tests G on the second day - This is possible since Reynaldo cannot test F, and G is not F.\n\nB: Seamus tests F on the first day - This is not possible since Yuki cannot test J, and Seamus cannot test F.\n\nC: Theresa tests F on the second day - This is possible since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and H is not F.\n\nD: Reynaldo tests H on the first day - This is not possible since Reynaldo cannot test F.\n\nE: Yuki tests F on the second day - This is possible since Yuki tests F on the first day, and the statement given in the problem states that the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Yuki tests F on the second day.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
