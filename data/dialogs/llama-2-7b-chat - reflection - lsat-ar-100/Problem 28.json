Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\n\n  Thought: To determine the fifth scientist that must be selected, we need to apply the conditions given in the problem.\n\n1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Since four of the selected scientists are botanists, we need to select one zoologist.\n2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since four botanists have already been selected, we can select only one zoologist.\n3. K and M cannot both be selected. Since M has already been selected, K cannot be selected.\n4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since M has already been selected, P and R must be selected.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

Based on the conditions given in the problem, we need to select the fifth scientist such that the panel meets the requirements.\n\n1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Since four of the selected scientists are botanists, we need to select one zoologist. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a zoologist.\n2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since four botanists have already been selected, we can select only one zoologist.\n3. K and M cannot both be selected. Since M has already been selected, K cannot be selected.\n4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since M has already been selected, P and R must be selected.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the fifth scientist that must be selected is E, the only remaining zoologist. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) - Zoologist."
