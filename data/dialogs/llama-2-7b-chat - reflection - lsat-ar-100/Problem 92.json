Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim\n  B: Mahr\n  C: Stuckey\n  D: Tiao\n  E: Udall\n\n  Thought: Based on the conditions provided, we can determine the possible combinations of sales representatives working in each sales zone.\n\nZone 1: Either Parra or Tiao works here, but not both. So, there are two possible combinations:\n\n1. Parra and Tiao in Zone 1\n2. Parra in Zone 1 and Tiao in another zone\n\nZone 2: Either Tiao or Udall works here, but not both. So, there are two possible combinations:\n\n1. Tiao in Zone 2 and Udall in another zone\n2. Udall in Zone 2 and Tiao in another zone\n\nZone 3: There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there must be more than one sales representative in Zone 3.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations of sales representatives in each zone based on the conditions provided:\n\nZone 1: Parra or Tiao can work here. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in another zone. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in another zone. So, the possible combinations for Zone 1 are:\n\n1. Parra and Tiao in Zone 1\n2. Parra in Zone 1 and Tiao in another zone\n\nZone 2: Tiao or Udall can work here. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in another zone. If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in another zone. So, the possible combinations for Zone 2 are:\n\n1. Tiao in Zone 2 and Udall in another zone\n2. Udall in Zone 2 and Tiao in another zone\n\nZone 3: There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there must be more than one sales representative in Zone 3.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations of sales representatives in each zone based on the conditions provided:\n\nZone 3: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall can all work in Zone 3. So, the possible combinations for Zone 3 are:\n\n1. Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall in Zone 3\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Udall.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
