Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the constraints given in the problem:\n\n1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the choices:\n\nA: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nThis cannot be true because, according to constraint 2, if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships. But, according to constraint 1, only one of Kayne or Novetzke can be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, so Jaramillo cannot be assigned to Zambia.\n\nB: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nThis cannot be true because, according to constraint 1, either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Also, constraint 2 states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships, so Kayne cannot be assigned to Zambia.\n\nC: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nThis cannot be true because, according to constraint 1, either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Also, constraint 2 states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Novetzke is also assigned to one of the ambassadorships, so Novetzke cannot be assigned to Zambia.\n\nD: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nThis cannot be true because constraint 4 states that if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nE: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nThis cannot be true because constraint 3 states that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. So, Ong must be assigned to at least one of the ambassadorships.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
