Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the schedule of the students' reports?\nChoices:\n  A: Mon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Robert Tues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Kyle\n  B: Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  C: Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving\n  D: Mon. morning: Nina; Mon. afternoon: Helen Tues. morning: Robert; Tues. afternoon: Irving Wed. morning: Olivia; Wed. afternoon: Lenore\n  E: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina Tues. morning: Irving; Tues. afternoon: Helen Wed. morning: Kyle; Wed. afternoon: George\n\n  Topic: Law\n\nThe given conditions can be represented in a truth table as follows:\n\n| Day | Student | Morning Report | Afternoon Report |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monday | George | ✘ | ✘ |\n| Monday | Helen | ✓ | ✘ |\n| Monday | Irving | ✘ | ✓ |\n| Tuesday | Olivia | ✘ | ✓ |\n| Tuesday | Kyle | ✘ | ✓ |\n| Wednesday | Lenore | ✘ | ✓ |\n| Wednesday | Robert | ✘ | ✓ |\n\nBased on the conditions provided, we can deduce the following possible schedules for the students' reports:\n\nE: Mon. morning: Olivia; Mon. afternoon: Nina\n\nExplanation:\n\n* On Monday, Helen gives a report in the morning, and Irving gives a report in the afternoon.\n* On Tuesday, Olivia cannot give a report in the afternoon, so Kyle must give a report in the afternoon.\n* On Wednesday, Lenore gives a report in the morning, and Robert gives a report in the afternoon.\n\nTherefore, the schedule of the students' reports is:\n\nMon. morning: Helen; Mon. afternoon: Irving\nTues. morning: Olivia; Tues. afternoon: Kyle\nWed. morning: Lenore; Wed. afternoon: Robert\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
