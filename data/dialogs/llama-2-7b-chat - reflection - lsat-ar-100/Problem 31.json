Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?\nChoices:\n  A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  B: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\n  C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\n  D: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  E: oatmeal: Monday, Thursday, Friday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n\n  Topic: Law\n\nContext: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.\n\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?\n\nChoices:\n\nA: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe bakery makes exactly three batches of each kind of cookie each week, from Monday to Friday. The conditions given in the question are:\n\n* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nUsing these conditions, we can deduce the following possible days on which each kind of cookie is made:\n\n* Oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday (at least one batch on each of these days)\n* Peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch)\n* Sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday (the second batch is made on Thursday)\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made is:\n\nA: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n\nAnswer: A\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
