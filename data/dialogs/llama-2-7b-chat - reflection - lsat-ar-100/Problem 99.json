Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either\nChoices:\n  A: first or second\n  B: second or third\n  C: fourth or sixth\n  D: fourth or seventh\n  E: sixth or seventh\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the conditions given in the problem:\n\n1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.\n2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.\n3. O is performed either first or fifth.\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n5. P is performed at some time before S.\n6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA) First or second: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either first or second. However, this violates condition 2, as there is no composition performed after F and before R. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nB) Second or third: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either second or third. This satisfies conditions 1 and 2, but violates condition 6, as there is no composition performed after O and before S. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nC) Fourth or sixth: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either fourth or sixth. This satisfies conditions 1 and 2, but violates condition 5, as there is no composition performed at some time before S. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nD) Fourth or seventh: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either fourth or seventh. This satisfies conditions 1 and 2, but violates condition 6, as there is no composition performed after O and before S. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nE) Sixth or seventh: If O is performed immediately after T, then F must be performed either sixth or seventh. This satisfies conditions 1 and 2, and also satisfies condition 6, as there is a composition performed after O and before S. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
