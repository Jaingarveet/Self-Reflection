        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\n\n  Thought: To determine the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem.\n\nAction: Let's use a diagram to represent the solos and the pianists.\n\nSolos: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\nPianists: Wayne, Zara\n\nSince the third solo is a traditional piece, we know that Wayne will not perform a traditional piece in the first two solos. Therefore, the first solo will be either a modern piece performed by Wayne or a traditional piece performed by Zara.\n\nIn the second solo, Zara will perform a traditional piece, so the third solo must be a modern piece performed by Wayne.\n\nIn the fourth solo, either Wayne or Zara can perform a traditional piece, but since Wayne has already performed a modern piece in the third solo, Zara must perform a traditional piece in the fourth solo.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is 2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
