        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the conditions given in the question:\n\n1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday.\n5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following possibilities:\n\n1. Franco cannot testify on Monday.\n2. Franco cannot testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n3. Garcia and Hong cannot both testify on Tuesday.\n4. Garcia cannot be the only witness to testify on Monday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the choices:\n\nA: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Franco cannot testify on Monday.\n\nB: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\nThis choice is also incorrect because Franco and Iturbe cannot testify on the same day.\n\nC: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Garcia and Hong cannot both testify on Tuesday.\n\nD: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Garcia cannot be the only witness to testify on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday.\n\nE: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\nThis choice is incorrect because, as we have deduced, Jackson cannot testify on Tuesday, and two witnesses cannot testify on Monday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D).\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
