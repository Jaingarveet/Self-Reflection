Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the information given in the question:\n\n* Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).\n* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: First batch of sugar cookies made on Monday.\n\n* This means that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, which is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and Monday is not Thursday.\n\nScenario 2: First batch of oatmeal cookies made on Tuesday.\n\n* This is possible, but it means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, which is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n\nScenario 3: First batch of peanut butter cookies made on Wednesday.\n\n* This is possible, but it means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, which is not possible since the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of sugar cookies.\n\nScenario 4: Second batch of peanut butter cookies made on Tuesday.\n\n* This is possible, but it means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, which is not possible since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of peanut butter cookies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
