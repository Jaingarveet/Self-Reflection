Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the conditions given in the problem:\n\n1. George can give a report on Tuesday, so there are 7 students who can give reports on Tuesday.\n2. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so there are 5 students who can give afternoon reports.\n3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of students giving reports:\n\n1. Monday: Helen, Kyle, and Lenore can give reports.\n2. Tuesday: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina can give reports.\n3. Wednesday: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina can give reports.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Helen gives a report on Monday: This is not possible since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore are the only ones who can give reports on Monday.\nB. Irving gives a report on Monday: This is also not possible since Irving, Kyle, and Lenore are the only ones who can give reports on Monday.\nC. Irving gives a report on Wednesday: This is possible since Irving can give a report on Wednesday, but it is not the only possibility.\nD. Kyle gives a report on Tuesday: This is not possible since Kyle can only give a report on Wednesday.\nE. Kyle gives a report on Wednesday: This is possible since Kyle can give a report on Wednesday, but it is not the only possibility.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
