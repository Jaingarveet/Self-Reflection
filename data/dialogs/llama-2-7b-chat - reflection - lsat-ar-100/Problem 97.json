Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookieâ€”oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\n  B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n  C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\n  D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\n  E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the situation:\n\nIf the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then we can deduce the following:\n\n* The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on a different day than the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\nA: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\nThis cannot be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, which means that only one kind of cookie (peanut butter) has its first batch made on Monday.\n\nB: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\nThis is the correct answer. Since the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then two different kinds of cookies (peanut butter and oatmeal) have their first batch made on Tuesday.\n\nC: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.\nThis cannot be true because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is Thursday.\n\nD: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.\nThis is also not true because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nE: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.\nThis is not possible because there are only three batches of cookies made each week, and the third batch is always the third batch of the same kind of cookie.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on a different day.\n2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means it is made on Thursday.\n3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\nA: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.\nThis cannot be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, which means that only one kind of cookie (peanut butter) has its first batch made on Monday.\n\nB: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\nThis is the correct answer.
