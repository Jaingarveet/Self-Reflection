Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n\n  Thought: Based on the given rules, we need to assign parking spaces to the six new employees in a way that no two employees are assigned the same parking space and that Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the possible assignments of parking spaces to the six employees:\n\n1. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so let's assign him parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n2. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so let's assign him parking space #5 or #6.\n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, so let's assign him parking space #1 or #2.\n4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so let's assign him parking space #3 or #4.\n5. Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, so let's assign him parking space #2 or #3.\n6. Vaughn is not mentioned in the problem statement, so let's assume he is assigned parking space #5 or #6.\n\nNow, let's check which one of the given options could be true:\n\nOption A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nThis is not possible since Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, and parking space #1 is the lowest-numbered parking space.\n\nOption B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nThis is possible since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and parking space #2 is a higher-numbered parking space.\n\nOption C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nThis is not possible since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and parking space #3 is a lower-numbered parking space.\n\nOption D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nThis is possible since Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, and parking space #3 is a lower-numbered parking space.\n\nOption E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nThis is not possible since Vaughn is not mentioned in the problem statement, and parking space #4 is not assigned to any of the six employees.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
