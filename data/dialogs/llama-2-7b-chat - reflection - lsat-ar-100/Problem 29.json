Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the given information to determine the correct answer.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we know that:\n\n1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n\nIf L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we can deduce the following:\n\n1. H must be placed on the bottom shelf.\n2. L must be placed on the middle shelf.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the given choices:\n\nA: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince F is placed on the same shelf as M, and M is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that F and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.\n\nB: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince H is placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that G and H are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice B is incorrect.\n\nC: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince M is placed on the same shelf as F, and F is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that H and M are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.\n\nD: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince I is placed on the middle shelf, and G is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that I and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.\n\nE: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nSince O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and L is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that K and O are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice E is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) I and G are not placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
