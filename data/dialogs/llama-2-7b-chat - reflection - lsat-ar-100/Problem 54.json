Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the given conditions to determine the possible combinations of plays reviewed by each student.\n\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n\nFrom these conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n* Jiang does not review Tamerlane, as otherwise, Kramer and O'Neill would not both review Tamerlane.\n* Lopez reviews either Sunset or Undulation, as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n* Megregian reviews either Sunset or Tamerlane, as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n* O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Jiang does not review Tamerlane, so Jiang cannot review Sunset.\nB: Lopez reviews Undulation, but this is not consistent with the given conditions.\nC: Megregian does not review Sunset, as Lopez reviews Undulation.\nD: Megregian does not review Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\nE: O'Neill does not review Undulation, as Lopez reviews Undulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
