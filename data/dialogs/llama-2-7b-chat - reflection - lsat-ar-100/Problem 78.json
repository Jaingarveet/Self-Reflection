Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n\n  Thought: Based on the conditions provided, we need to determine which days each of the students can give their reports.\n\nGeorge can give a report on Tuesday, as it is the only day he is allowed to give a report.\nNina can give a report on either Monday or Tuesday, as the conditions do not specify which day she must give her report.\nRobert cannot give a report on Wednesday, as the conditions state that he cannot give an afternoon report on that day.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
