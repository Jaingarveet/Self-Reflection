Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\n\n  Thought: Let's analyze the constraints given in the problem:\n\n1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\n\nNow, let's use the elimination method to find the answer.\n\nEliminate option E: Julio's session cannot meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, as Olivia's session is on Friday, and Julio's session cannot meet on Friday.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining options:\n\nOption A: Rebecca can lead a Thursday session, as she is not assigned to lead a session on Wednesday.\nOption B: Olivia can lead a Thursday session, as she is assigned to lead an afternoon session on Friday.\nOption C: Nessa can lead a Thursday session, as she is assigned to lead an afternoon session.\nOption D: Kevin cannot lead a Thursday session, as he is assigned to lead a session on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Option B: Olivia.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
