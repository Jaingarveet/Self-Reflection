The bay holding fuel is numbered 3, and the bay holding machinery is numbered 5. Therefore, Choice A must be false.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the information provided in the problem. In this case, the information provided in the problem does not allow for the bay holding fuel to be next to the bay holding machinery. It is also important to pay attention to the numbering of the bays and the types of cargo they are holding, as this information is crucial to solving the problem.\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is Choice E, The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. The bay holding textiles is numbered 2, and the bay holding produce is numbered 4. Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be next to the bay holding produce."
