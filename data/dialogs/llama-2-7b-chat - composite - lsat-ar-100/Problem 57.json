Here is my reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\nI mistakenly chose option A, George and Lenore, as the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other. However, Lenore cannot give a report on Tuesday, as the condition states that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, Helen and Nina.\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is option B, Helen and Nina. If Helen and Nina give reports on the same day as each other, they must give reports on Wednesday, as neither of them can give a report on Tuesday due to the condition stated earlier.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the conditions given in the question. In this case, the condition that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, and the condition that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, were crucial in determining the correct answer. Additionally, it can be helpful to create a diagram or flowchart to visualize the possible combinations of students and their report schedules."
