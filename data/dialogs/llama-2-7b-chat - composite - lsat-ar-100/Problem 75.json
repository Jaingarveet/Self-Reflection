The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nThe question asks for an accurate and complete list of students who review only Sunset, based on the given conditions. We need to analyze the information provided to determine which students review only Sunset.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. Kramer and [REDACTED] each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n\t* This means that Kramer and [REDACTED] do not review Sunset.\n2. Neither [REDACTED] nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n\t* This means that Jiang does not review Sunset.\n3. Kramer and [REDACTED] both review Tamerlane.\n\t* This means that Kramer and [REDACTED] do not review Sunset.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining options:\n\nA) [REDACTED] - Does not review Sunset as per condition 1.\nB) [REDACTED] - Does not review Sunset as per condition 3.\nC) Jiang, [REDACTED] - Both do not review Sunset as per condition 2.\nD) Kramer, [REDACTED] - Both review Tamerlane, so they do not review Sunset.\nE) [REDACTED], Megregian - Neither [REDACTED] nor Megregian reviews Sunset, so this option is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review only Sunset is:\n\nAnswer(\"[REDACTED]\") Kramer, [REDACTED].\n\nCorrect Answer: A\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
