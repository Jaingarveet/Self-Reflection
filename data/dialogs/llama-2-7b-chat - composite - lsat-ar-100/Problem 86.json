For example, the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (C) four.\n\nReasoning:\nIf bay 4 is holding produce, then the type of cargo in bays 1-3 and 5-6 is completely determined. Bay 1 is holding fuel, bay 2 is holding grain, bay 3 is holding livestock, bay 5 is holding textiles, and bay 6 is holding produce.\n\nTherefore, the type of cargo in exactly four of the six bays is completely determined: bays 1, 2, 3, and 5."
