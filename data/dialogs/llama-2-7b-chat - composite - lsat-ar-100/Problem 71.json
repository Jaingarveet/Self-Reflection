I will use this information to help me answer the question correctly.\n\nBased on the given conditions, we can determine the sales representatives working in Zone 3 as follows:\n\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, so Parra or Tiao cannot work in Zone 3.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, so Tiao or Udall cannot work in Zone 3.\n3. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so at least one of the sales representatives in Zone 2 must work in Zone 3.\n\nUsing these conditions, we can conclude that the sales representatives working in Zone 3 are:\n\n* Parra\n* Quinn\n* Stuckey\n* Udall\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is (E) Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to practice and improve my problem-solving skills.
