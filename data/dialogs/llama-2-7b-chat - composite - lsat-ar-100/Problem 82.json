Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

        "content": "  Topic: Law\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* I mistakenly matched Parra and Tiao in the same zone.\n* I failed to consider the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nSolution:\nThe correct matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work is:\n\nZone 1: Kim, Tiao\nZone 2: Stuckey, Udall\nZone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Parra\n\nExplanation:\nThe condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 means that at least one of Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Tiao cannot both work in the same zone, Parra must work in Zone 3 and Tiao must work in Zone 1.\n\nThe remaining sales representatives can be matched to their respective zones based on the given conditions:\n\n* Kim works in Zone 1 with Tiao.\n* Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in Zone 2.\n* Mahr, Quinn, and Parra work in Zone 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work is:\n\nZone 1: Kim, Tiao\nZone 2: Stuckey, Udall\nZone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Parra.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen solving this type of problem, it is essential to carefully read and understand the given conditions and to use logical reasoning to match the sales representatives to their respective zones. It is also important to double-check your answer to ensure that it is correct."
