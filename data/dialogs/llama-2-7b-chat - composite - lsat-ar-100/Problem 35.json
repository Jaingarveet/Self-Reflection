Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n\nLet's analyze the information given in the question:\n\n* Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).\n* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each of the options:\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nTrue. Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, and there are five days in a week, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nFalse. According to the information given, no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nTrue. Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nFalse. According to the information given, no batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nTrue. Since no batches of cookies are made on Friday, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
