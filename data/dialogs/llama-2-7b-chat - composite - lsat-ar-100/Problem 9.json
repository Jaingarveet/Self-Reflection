Therefore, the only possible parking space that Young could be assigned is #2.\n\nAdvice:\n\nWhen solving this problem, it is important to carefully read and understand the given rules and constraints. In this case, it was crucial to remember that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. By following these rules, we can determine the correct assignment of parking spaces for each employee."
