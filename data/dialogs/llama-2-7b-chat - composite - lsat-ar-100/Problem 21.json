The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

Here is my reflection on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer:\n\nProblem: The government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia, while satisfying the constraints given.\nSolution: I mistakenly chose option (C) Kayne and Landon as the answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option violates the constraints given. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.\n\nCorrect Answer: The correct answer is option (E) Landon and Novetzke. This option satisfies all the constraints given, as Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela if Ong is assigned to that position, and Landon cannot be assigned to Yemen if Kayne is assigned to that position.\n\nAdvice: When solving this type of problem, it is essential to carefully read and understand the constraints given. In this case, the constraints are crucial in determining the correct answer. It is also important to reflect on your previous answers and identify any mistakes, as this can help you improve your problem-solving skills."
