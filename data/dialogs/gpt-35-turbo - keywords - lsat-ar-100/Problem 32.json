Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - False conclusion\n - Logical error\n"

Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 2 days and Truvest's website target must be 3 days. Solide's voicemail target must be shorter than Truvest's voicemail target, so Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days. Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day. It could be 2 days if Image's voicemail target is also 2 days.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
