The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  B: Image's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Assumption error\n - Logical error\n"
