Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Assumption error\n - Scenario error\n - Logic error\n"

This violates the condition that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, A is not true.\nIf the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
