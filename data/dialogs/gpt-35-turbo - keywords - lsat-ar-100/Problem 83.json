Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Lan's session meets Wednesday morning.\n  B: Lan's session meets Thursday afternoon.\n  C: Nessa's session meets Friday afternoon.\n  D: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n  E: Olivia's session meets Friday morning.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Ignored constraints\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Overlooked details\n"
