The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then each of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.\n  B: Bay 4 is holding produce.\n  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.\n  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.\n  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misreading the question\n - Misinterpreting the problem\n - Logical error\n"
