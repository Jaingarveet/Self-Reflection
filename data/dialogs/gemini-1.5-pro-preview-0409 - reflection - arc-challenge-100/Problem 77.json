Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\n\nThought:\nThe introduction of a predator will likely favor traits that aid in escaping or hiding. Since the sheep with light wool have increased despite being smaller and weaker, it suggests their lighter color provides a survival advantage, possibly camouflage. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the existing trend of increasing light-wool sheep without considering the impact of the new predator. I assumed the existing trend would continue without considering the change in the environment.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Incorrect extrapolation\n*   Ignoring environmental change\n*   Misinterpretation of trend\n**Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze the situation:** The introduction of a predator changes the selection pressure on the sheep population.\n2.  **Consider the predator's impact:** Predators are more likely to catch and kill weaker, slower prey.\n3.  **Apply this to the sheep:** Dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, making them better equipped to escape or defend against predators.\n4.  **Predict the outcome:** The population of light wool sheep, being weaker and more vulnerable, will likely decrease first.\n**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**\n1.  **Identify the initial conditions and any changes to the environment.**\n2.  **Analyze how the environmental change affects the selection pressures on the population.**\n3.  **Consider the traits of different individuals and how they relate to the new selection pressures.**\n4.  **Predict the population changes based on which traits provide an advantage in the new environment.**\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Always consider the full context of the situation, including any changes to the environment.**\n*   **Avoid assuming that existing trends will continue without considering external factors.**\n*   **Focus on the specific selection pressures introduced by the change and how they affect different individuals.**\n*   **Think critically about the advantages and disadvantages of different traits in the new context.** \n"
