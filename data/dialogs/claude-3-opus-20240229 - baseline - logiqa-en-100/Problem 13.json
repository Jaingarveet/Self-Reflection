Despite this surplus, some people die due to a shortage of materials\n3. The author finds this situation morally disgusting and intellectually absurd\n4. The author feels shocked and ashamed by this stupidity\nThe author is not attributing the deaths to individual laziness, stupidity, or personality defects. Rather, they are expressing outrage at a systemic failure to properly distribute resources, leading to unnecessary deaths in a world of plenty.\nTherefore, the obvious meaning aligns best with choice C: From the two levels of morality and intelligence, we should have designed a distribution system so that each member of society can live a decent and dignified life.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
