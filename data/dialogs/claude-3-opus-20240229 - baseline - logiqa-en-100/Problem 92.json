However, this is not possible because their statements directly contradict each other.\n- If Professor Qian is correct, then Professor Zhao is one-to-one wrong (correct about Tsinghua University not being the champion, but wrong about Zhejiang University), and Professor Sun is completely wrong.\n- If Professor Sun is correct, then Professor Zhao is one-to-one wrong (correct about Zhejiang University not being the champion, but wrong about Tsinghua University), and Professor Qian is completely wrong.\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is when Professor Qian is correct.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
