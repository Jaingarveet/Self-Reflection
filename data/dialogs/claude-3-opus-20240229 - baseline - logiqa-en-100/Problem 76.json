Therefore, R is Q\", which is a valid argument form.\nD) This also does not match. It just states that criminal behaviors, being illegal, should be condemned by society.\nTherefore, choice A is the only one that clearly shows the original argument is invalid by using the same structure to reach a false conclusion.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
