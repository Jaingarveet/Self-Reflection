However, great painters often spend most of their time alone and don't have intimate relationships.\n3. The argument concludes that the psychological theory is untenable based on the example of great painters.\nThe key assumption here is that the great painters, despite not having intimate relationships, are not unhappy. If they were unhappy, it would support the psychological theory rather than refute it.\nTherefore, the argument assumes that artists who have achieved great things cannot be unhappy, even though they lack intimate relationships.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
