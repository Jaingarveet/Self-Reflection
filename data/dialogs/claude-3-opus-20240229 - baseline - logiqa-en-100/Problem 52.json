        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The context states that employee wages are included in the cost, while the boss's profit is not included in the cost.\n2. It also states that there is an inverse relationship between cost and profit - if cost is high, profit is low, and vice versa.\n3. This implies that there is a conflict of interest between the boss and the employees. The boss wants to maximize profit, which means minimizing cost (and thus wages). Employees, on the other hand, want to maximize their wages.\n4. Now, let's look at the choices:\n   A suggests that if employees hold shares, there is a conflict of interest with the boss. This doesn't follow from the given information.\n   B suggests that if employees hold shares, there is no conflict of interest. This also doesn't follow. Even if employees hold shares, they still primarily earn through wages, which is in conflict with the boss's profit motive.\n   C suggests that if employees don't hold shares, there will be a conflict of interest. This directly follows from the context. The context implies a conflict of interest due to the inverse relationship between wages (cost) and profit, regardless of share ownership.\n   D is not supported by the context. The context doesn't provide information about the relative earnings of the boss and employees.\n5. Therefore, C is the most strongly supported conclusion.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
