E and M: If E participates, then F cannot participate. And if F doesn't participate, then M cannot participate either. So this cannot be the correct answer.\nC. F and K: If F participates, then E cannot participate. If K participates, then J cannot participate. However, we don't know for certain if G will participate in this case.\nD. G and K: If K participates, then J cannot participate. And if J doesn't participate, we don't know for certain if G will participate. \nNone of the choices can be definitively determined based on the given conditions and the fact that H is not participating. More information would be needed to answer this question conclusively.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
