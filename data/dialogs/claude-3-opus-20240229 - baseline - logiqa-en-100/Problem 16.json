When polluting industries are transferred from developed to developing countries:\n   - Developed countries benefit from improved natural environment\n   - Developing countries are compensated with increased employment and taxes, despite the environmental pollution\n2. As a result, both sides benefit, leading to an increase in total global welfare.\nNow, let's examine each choice to determine which one is a necessary assumption (hypothesis) for the economist's argument:\nA. The relative importance of a good natural environment for people in developed vs. developing countries is not discussed in the argument. The argument does not rely on this assumption.\nB. The existence of polluting enterprises in both developed and developing countries is not a necessary assumption. The argument focuses on the transfer of these industries from one to the other.\nC. The relative degree of environmental pollution between developed and developing countries is not mentioned or assumed in the argument.\nD. The economist's argument relies on the assumption that polluting industries can generate more profits (through increased employment and taxes) in developing countries than in developed countries. This assumption is necessary for the claim that the transfer leads to an overall improvement in global welfare.\nTherefore, the hypothesis discussed by the economist is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
