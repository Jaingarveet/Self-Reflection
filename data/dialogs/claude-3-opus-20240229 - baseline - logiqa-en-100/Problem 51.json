If X and F are assigned to the same department, then X must also be in the production department.\n3. If X is in the production department, then W must be in the production department too (condition 3).\n4. This means that all three spots in the production department are filled by F, X, and W.\n5. H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1), and it can't be production as it's full. So they must be either in sales or public relations.\n6. F and G can't be in the same department (condition 2), and F is in production, so G must be in either sales or public relations.\n7. If H and Y are in public relations, then G and I must be in sales. But if H and Y are in sales, then one of G or I must be in public relations.\n8. Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is \"W is assigned to the public relations department\", because W must be in production if X is in production with F.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
