Most people believe scientists rely on strict logical reasoning, not image thinking methods like analogy, intuition, and epiphany.\n2. However, research shows Nobel Prize winners use image thinking methods more than general scientists.\n3. Therefore, the conclusion is that image thinking methods help achieve major scientific breakthroughs.\nThe key to the conclusion is the link between Nobel Prize winners, their use of image thinking methods, and their scientific breakthroughs.\nLooking at the choices:\nA. This is not assumed in the argument. The reasoning methods of general scientists are not discussed.\nB. This is somewhat relevant but not directly assumed. The argument states they use image thinking more, but doesn't necessarily assume they have a special ability for it.\nC. This is the most relevant assumption. The argument relies on Nobel Prize winners having made major breakthroughs, which is then attributed to their greater use of image thinking methods.\nD. The argument does not make assumptions about intelligence or effort of the scientists.\nTherefore, the conclusion most directly relies on the assumption that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
