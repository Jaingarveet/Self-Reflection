He Zhilian is not selected, so the 2 girls must be Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.\n3. Now for the boys, we have the following conditions:\n   - Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together\n   - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together\n4. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua can be selected (condition 1 allows this).\n5. So we can select these 3 boys: Ren Xiangyang, Tang Xiaohua, and either Peng Youwen or Song Wenkai.\n6. This means that Qiu Zhijie cannot be selected, because if he was, then Tang Xiaohua couldn't be (by condition 3), and we would only have 2 boys.\nTherefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, Qiu Zhijie must also not be selected.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
