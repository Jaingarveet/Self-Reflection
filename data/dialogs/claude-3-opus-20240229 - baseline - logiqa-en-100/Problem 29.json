This ignores the possibility of objective standards of truth and logic that exist independently of any individual's opinion.\n2. The argument confuses the concept of having an opinion with the ability to judge the truth of an argument. Just because someone shares an opinion with one of the debaters doesn't necessarily mean they can't judge the argument objectively.\n3. The reasons given in the argument for why each potential judge can't make a judgment are not logically sound. For example, just because someone has a different opinion doesn't mean they are incapable of judging an argument fairly.\n4. The argument doesn't actually address the original question of whether the debaters themselves can distinguish between true and false through their debate. Instead, it focuses on the inability to find an appropriate judge, which is a separate issue.\nGiven these points, the best answer seems to be A. The argument ignores the existence of objective standards of truth and logic that could be used to evaluate the debate, regardless of the opinions of the debaters or potential judges.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
