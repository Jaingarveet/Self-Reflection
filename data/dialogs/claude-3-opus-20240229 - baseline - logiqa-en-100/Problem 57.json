The argument states that a large compensation gap between senior managers stimulates competition between departments, while a small gap stimulates cooperation.\n2. It then states that 3M companies work in cooperation with each other.\n3. Based on the logic presented, if 3M companies work cooperatively, it implies that they likely have a smaller compensation gap between senior managers.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   A. This contradicts the logic presented. If 3M works cooperatively, the gap should be small, not large.\n   B. While this may be true, it doesn't directly follow from the argument about compensation gaps.\n   C. This follows logically from the premises. If 3M works cooperatively, and cooperative work is associated with smaller compensation gaps, then 3M likely has smaller compensation gaps.\n   D. This is tangential to the main argument, which is about 3M specifically, not the general effects of competition.\nTherefore, the most appropriate conclusion is C: 3M company's senior managers have smaller gaps in compensation.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
