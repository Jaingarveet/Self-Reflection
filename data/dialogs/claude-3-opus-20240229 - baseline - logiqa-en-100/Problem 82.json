This weakens the argument that the house is not protected by law.\nB: This choice strengthens the argument. If the newly built house is a small property house, it supports the conclusion that it is not protected by law.\nC: The fact that the house is built on rural collective land does not directly affect whether it is protected by law or not. The argument's strength is not impacted by this statement.\nD: If some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses, it implies that they may be legally registered and protected. This weakens the generalization that all newly built houses in the village, including the one in question, are not protected by law.\nTherefore, choice D would most weaken the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
