This doesn't explain the outflow.\nB: If bank interest rates are expected to increase, residents would likely keep their money in the bank to earn higher interest, not withdraw it. This also doesn't explain the outflow.\nC: If private lending interest rates are much higher than bank deposit rates, it makes sense that residents would withdraw their savings to lend privately and earn higher returns. This could explain the large outflow of savings.\nD: Residents considering investing in stocks or funds could explain some outflow, but it's unlikely to account for such a large amount (100 billion yuan) in a short period.\nAmong the given choices, C provides the most plausible explanation for the significant outflow of savings deposits.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
