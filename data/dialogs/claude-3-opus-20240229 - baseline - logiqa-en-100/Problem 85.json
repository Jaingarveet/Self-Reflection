Condition (2) states that paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J. But it doesn't say that both G and H must be used together. So choice B is not necessarily true.\n3. Condition (1) says that if paper E is used, then paper K must be used. But we know from (4) that paper E cannot be used. So we can't conclude anything about paper K from this. Also, there's no information about paper J. So choice C is not necessarily true.\n4. Condition (3) says that if paper G is not used, then paper K is not used. But it doesn't say anything about paper J. So choice D is not necessarily true.\nTherefore, none of the given choices must be true based on the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
