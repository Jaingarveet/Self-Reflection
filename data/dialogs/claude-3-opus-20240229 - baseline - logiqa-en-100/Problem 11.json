This means that if someone is from Harbin, they must be a northerner. \n2. The second part says \"some people in Harbin are not workers\". This means that there exist people from Harbin who are not workers.\n3. Combining these two parts, we can conclude that there are some people who are northerners (because they are from Harbin), but are not workers.\n4. This directly corresponds to choice B: \"Some northerners are not workers\".\nThe other choices:\n- A and C: We can't conclude anything about workers being northerners or vice versa, as the statement doesn't provide any information about workers.\n- D: This is the opposite of what we concluded. We know some northerners (those from Harbin) are not workers, but we can't say anything about workers not being northerners.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
