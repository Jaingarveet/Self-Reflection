Let's consider both cases:\n   Case 1: E participates\n   - If E participates, then F does not participate.\n   - If F does not participate, then M does not participate.\n   Case 2: F participates\n   - If F participates, then E does not participate.\n   - If F participates, M may or may not participate.\n2. We also know that either J or K will participate, but not both. Let's consider both cases:\n   Case 1: J participates\n   - If J participates, then G must also participate.\n   - If J participates, then K does not participate.\n   Case 2: K participates\n   - If K participates, then J does not participate.\n   - If K participates, G may or may not participate.\n3. Now, let's look at the answer choices:\n   A: F and H - This could be a valid choice, as F can participate, and H is not restricted by any conditions.\n   B: G and J - This could also be a valid choice, as if J participates, G must also participate.\n   C: G and M - This is not a valid choice, as there is no condition that requires both G and M to participate together.\n   D: H and M - This is not a valid choice, as if M participates, F must also participate, but H and F together would exceed the limit of 4 players.\n4. Therefore, the only choices that could make the four-person team the only choice are A (F and H) and B (G and J).\nAction: Answer(\"A\") and Answer(\"B\")"
