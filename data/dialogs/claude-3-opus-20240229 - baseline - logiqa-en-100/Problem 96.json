Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?\nChoices:\n  A: The cost and selling price of \"Inferno\" are lower than that of \"Harbour\".\n  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.\n  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.\n  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to \"Inferno\" magazine.\n"

This choice does not strengthen the argument.\nB: If the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts maintained their benefits after switching to other publications, it suggests they did not suffer economically due to their decision. This supports the idea that they prioritized ethical responsibilities over potential economic gains from advertising in \"Inferno\". This choice strengthens the argument.\nC: While this choice suggests that the content change may not align with the interests of the original readers, it does not directly address the advertisers' motivations or considerations. It does not significantly strengthen the argument.\nD: Clients switching to \"Inferno\" magazine might indicate that some advertisers prioritize reaching the new target audience over ethical concerns. However, this does not directly support the claim that the advertisers who left were motivated by ethical responsibilities. It does not strengthen the argument as effectively as choice B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
