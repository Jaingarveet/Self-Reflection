This choice questions the opinion.\nB: The fact that grasslands in Mongolia are still thriving while those in Inner Mongolia have degraded suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible. This choice questions the opinion.\nC: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.\nD: This choice directly states that human factors, such as overgrazing and poor grassland management, are the main causes of increased dust storms. It supports the idea that the given opinion can be questioned.\nTherefore, all the choices suggest that the opinion can be questioned, as they point to human activities being the primary cause of grassland degradation and dust storms, rather than just climate drought.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
