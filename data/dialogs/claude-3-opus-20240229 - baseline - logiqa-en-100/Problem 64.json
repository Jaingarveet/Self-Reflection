People's daily thinking and actions involve conscious, active behaviors and creativity.\n2. All computer behaviors are controlled by pre-programmed programs.\n3. Therefore, computers cannot possess human initiative and creativity.\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\nA. If computers can learn like humans, it would weaken the argument that computers lack initiative and creativity.\nB. If computer programs cannot simulate human initiative and creativity, it directly supports the conclusion that computers cannot possess these traits.\nC. The future relationship between humans and computers is irrelevant to the current argument about computers lacking initiative and creativity.\nD. If people can create programs that simulate human initiative and creativity, it would contradict the argument that computers cannot possess these traits.\nChoice B most strongly supports the reasoning by reinforcing the idea that computer programs are fundamentally unable to replicate human initiative and creativity.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
