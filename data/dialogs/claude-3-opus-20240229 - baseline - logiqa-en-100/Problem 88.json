To be elected, every politician must cater to voters.\n3. Cheng Bian will do his best to cater to voters, as he wants to be elected.\n4. In many cases, it is impossible to cater to voters without writing many empty checks.\n5. Cheng Bian was in fact elected.\nGiven these facts, we can infer that since Cheng Bian did everything he could to cater to voters, and catering to voters often requires writing empty checks, it's likely that Cheng Bian wrote many empty checks in the process of getting elected.\nHowever, the word \"certainly\" in choices A and B is too strong. The passage states that catering to voters is \"in many cases\" impossible without empty checks, not always. So we can't be absolutely certain.\nBetween C and D, C aligns better with the information given. Cheng Bian probably wrote many empty checks, but we can't be sure he didn't.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
