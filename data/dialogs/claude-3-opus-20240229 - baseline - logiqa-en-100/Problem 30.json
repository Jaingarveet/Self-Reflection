At least one person of Bingding must be selected. This means either B or D (or both) must be in the selection.\n3. If E is selected, then A and B are also selected. However, the maximum number of people that can be selected is 2. So if E is selected, the group would be E, A, and B, which violates the maximum of 2 people. Therefore, E cannot be selected.\n4. Since a maximum of 2 people are selected, and one of them must be B or D, the other one can be either A or C.\nSo the possible combinations are:\n- B and A\n- B and C\n- D and A\n- D and C\nIn all these combinations, C is present in two of them, while Ding (D) is present in only two. Therefore, C has a higher chance of being in the fourth compared to Ding.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
