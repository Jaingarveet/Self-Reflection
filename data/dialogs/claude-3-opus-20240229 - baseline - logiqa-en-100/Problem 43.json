During the cultural axis period, every cultural area has its backbone thoughts.\n3. Each backbone thought has its contribution to world culture.\n4. China's backbone ideology includes Confucianism, Taoism, and Mohism.\n5. The ideas represented by Confucianism, Taoism, and Mohism have contributed to world culture.\nThe argument is trying to counter the European-centric bias by highlighting China's contributions to world culture during the cultural axis period. For this argument to be valid, it must assume that China was one of the cultural districts during that period.\nThe other choices (India, Greece, and Egypt) may or may not have been cultural districts during the cultural axis period, but the argument does not rely on those assumptions. It specifically focuses on China's role and contributions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
