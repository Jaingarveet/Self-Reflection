From condition (2), since F is in production, G cannot be in production. So G must be in either sales or public relations.\n3. From condition (1), H and Y must be in the same department. There are three possibilities:\n   - If H and Y are in production, then I, W, and X must be in sales (since F is already in production and G is not in production).\n   - If H and Y are in sales, then I, W, and X cannot all be in sales (since there are only 3 spots in sales). So at least one of I, W, or X must be in production or public relations.\n   - If H and Y are in public relations, then I, W, and X must be split between production and sales.\n4. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. This eliminates the possibility of H and Y being in production (because then X would be in sales and W would also have to be in sales, which is not possible).\n5. Looking at the answer choices:\n   - G and I could potentially be in sales together (if H and Y are in public relations).\n   - G and X could potentially be in sales together (if H and Y are in public relations).\n   - G and Y cannot be in sales together, because H and Y must be in the same department, and if H and Y are in sales, then G must be in public relations.\n   - H and W could potentially be in sales together (if X is in production or public relations).\nTherefore, the pair that is unlikely to be in sales together is G and Y.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
