Looking at the choices, only A and C have Q in the middle of Team 1, so B and D can be eliminated.\n3. Now, let's check conditions (3), (4), and (5) for choices A and C:\n   Choice A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N\n   - Condition (3) is satisfied as L is in team 1.\n   - Condition (4) is violated as N is in the same team as Q (Q is in place of P here).\n   - Condition (5) is satisfied as P is not involved.\n   Choice C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G\n   - Condition (3) is satisfied as L is in team 1.\n   - Condition (4) is satisfied as neither P nor K are involved.\n   - Condition (5) is satisfied as P is not involved.\n4. Therefore, Choice C satisfies all the relevant conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
