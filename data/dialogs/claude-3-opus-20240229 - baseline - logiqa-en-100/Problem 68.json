If a person only has one day to live, the argument suggests it's best for them to steal because they won't suffer the fear of being caught.\n3. However, if a person has 20 years to live, stealing is not the best choice because they will suffer the fear of being caught.\nThe key assumption here is that the person knows their life expectancy before deciding whether to steal. Without this knowledge, they cannot make a decision based on the fear of being caught.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: This directly states the assumption the argument relies on.\nB, C, and D: These choices are not assumptions made by the argument.\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
