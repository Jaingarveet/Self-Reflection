        "content": "To determine which choice most calls into doubt the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit behind soaring housing prices, let's consider each option:\nA: If housing prices in Shanghai increased by 19.1% while land prices only rose by 6.53%, this suggests factors other than land prices are significantly contributing to the housing price increase. This choice casts some doubt on the assertion.\nB: In Beijing, housing prices increased by 7.2% but land prices only rose by 0.37%. The large disparity between the housing and land price increases suggests land prices are not the primary driver of rising housing prices. This choice strongly questions the assertion.\nC: The real estate chairman's belief that increasing land development costs will definitely increase house prices supports the assertion rather than calling it into doubt.\nD: The development company chairman's statement that housing prices are skyrocketing due to supply not keeping up with demand points to factors other than land prices as the main reason. This challenges the assertion.\nConsidering all the choices, B most strongly calls into doubt the assertion by showing a case where housing prices rose much more dramatically than land prices, suggesting other factors besides land prices are the main drivers of housing price increases.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
