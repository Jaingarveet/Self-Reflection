Confucius is saying not to do things to others that you wouldn't want done to yourself. It doesn't imply that if you want something done to you, you should do it to others.\nB: \"If you want, then give it to others.\" This is also not a logical inference. Confucius is talking about not doing unwanted things to others, not about giving others what you want for yourself.\nC: \"Don't treat others unless you want to.\" This logically follows from Confucius' statement. If you don't want to do something, don't do it to others.\nD: \"Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.\" This is a logical inference. Confucius is saying you should only do to others what they would want done to them.\nTherefore, the option that is not a logical inference is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
