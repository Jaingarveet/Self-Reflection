According to rule (1), if valve No.1 is opened, then:\n   - Valve No.2 must be opened, and\n   - Valve No.5 must be closed.\n3. Now, according to rule (2), if valve No.2 is opened, then:\n   - Valve No.4 must be closed.\n4. Rule (3) states that valve No.3 and valve No.4 cannot be closed at the same time. \n   - We know valve No.4 must be closed (from step 3).\n   - Therefore, valve No.3 must be open to satisfy rule (3).\n5. In summary, when valve No.1 is opened:\n   - Valve No.2 must be opened (rule 1)\n   - Valve No.3 must be opened (to satisfy rule 3, since valve No.4 is closed)\n   - Valve No.4 must be closed (because valve No.2 is open, according to rule 2)\n   - Valve No.5 must be closed (rule 1)\nTherefore, the two valves that must be opened at the same time as valve No.1 are valve No.2 and valve No.3.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
