However, studying longer and having more books does not necessarily mean:\n   - Xiao Qiang has richer knowledge than Xiao Gang (Choice A)\n   - Xiao Qiang is smarter than Xiao Gang (Choice B)\n   - Xiao Qiang treats life more effectively than Xiao Gang (Choice C)\n4. The given information is insufficient to make comparisons about their knowledge, intelligence, or approach to life. We would need more specific information to draw those conclusions.\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice D: The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
