(given)\n   So Zhao was not hired by Tianshu.\n3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. (given)\n   Since Zhao was not hired by Tianshu, Liu was also not hired by Tianshu.\n4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan. (given)\nNow let's look at each choice:\nA. Li and Liu were hired by the same unit. \n   This is false because Li was hired by Tianshu but Liu was not.\nB. Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.\n   This could be true. We know Zhao and Liu were hired by the same unit, which could be Tianji.\nC. Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.\n   This is false. If only Liu was hired by Tianxuan, then Zhang and Wang would have to be hired by Tianji (because they can't be in Tianshu). But then the condition \"If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan\" would be violated.\nD. Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\n   This could be true. Zhang could be in Tianji, satisfying the condition.\nTherefore, B and D could be correct.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
