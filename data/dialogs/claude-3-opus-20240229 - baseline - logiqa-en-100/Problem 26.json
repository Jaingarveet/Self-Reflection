        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The two given statements are:\n   - \"Money is like dung\"\n   - \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\"\n2. If we assume both statements are true, we can substitute \"a thousand dollars\" with \"dung\" based on the first statement. This leads to the conclusion \"Friends are like dung\".\n3. However, we know that the conclusion \"Friends are like dung\" is absurd and not true. This means that at least one of the initial statements must be false.\n4. If \"Money is like dung\" is false, then even if friends are worth a thousand dollars, it doesn't lead to the absurd conclusion. \n5. Similarly, if \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" is false, then even if money is like dung, the absurd conclusion doesn't follow.\n6. Therefore, we can't be certain which specific statement is false, but we know that they can't both be true at the same time, as that leads to the absurd conclusion.\nThe choice that best captures this reasoning is D: The words \"Money is like dung\" and \"Friends are worth a thousand dollars\" are either true or false.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
