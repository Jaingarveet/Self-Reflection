You have ignored a statement about whether a country or society has the right to deprive anyone.If there is no such right, it does not matter whether the death penalty can prevent crime.\nQuestion: Assuming that the death penalty cannot prevent crime, then in which of the following ways will Zhang Shan and Li Si ’s views be affected?\nChoices:\n  A: Neither Zhang Shan nor Li Si ’s views will be strengthened or weakened.\n  B: Li Si ’s view was weakened, and Zhang Shan ’s view was strengthened.\n  C: Zhang Shan's view was weakened, Li Si's view was not affected.\n  D: Both Zhang Shan and Li Si's views were weakened.\n"

If it's assumed that the death penalty cannot prevent crime, then this key premise of Zhang Shan's argument is undermined. Thus, Zhang Shan's view would be weakened.\n2. Li Si's argument is that regardless of whether the death penalty can prevent crime, the fundamental question is whether a society has the right to deprive anyone of life. This argument does not depend on the effectiveness of the death penalty in preventing crime. So even if we assume the death penalty cannot prevent crime, Li Si's view would not be affected.\nTherefore, if we assume the death penalty cannot prevent crime, Zhang Shan's view would be weakened, while Li Si's view would not be affected.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
