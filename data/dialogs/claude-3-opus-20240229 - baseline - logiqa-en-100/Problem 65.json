The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict drunk driving investigations and those without.\n2. However, experts believe that strict drunk driving investigations can reduce traffic accidents.\n3. This seems inconsistent. We need to find an explanation that resolves this inconsistency.\n4. Choice A doesn't help because it just states that strict investigations have occurred in cities with traffic accidents. It doesn't explain the inconsistency.\n5. Choice B provides a potential explanation. If cities with strict investigations haven't actually eliminated drunk driving, then the incidence of accidents might still be similar to cities without strict investigations.\n6. Choice C suggests improving driver awareness is more important, but this doesn't directly address the inconsistency between the survey and expert opinion.\n7. Choice D suggests stopping other traffic violations in addition to drunk driving. While this might help reduce accidents overall, it doesn't specifically explain the inconsistency about drunk driving investigations.\nTherefore, Choice B seems most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency. It suggests that even with strict investigations, drunk driving hasn't been eliminated, which could explain why accident rates are still similar.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
