K cannot replace G in the binding group because if K is in a group, J must also be in that group according to condition (3). But J is already in the binding group.\n5. K can replace H in either the printing group or the binding group. This would not violate any conditions:\n   - Each group would still have at least 3 employees (condition 1).\n   - F and K would be in different groups (condition 2).\n   - If K replaces H in the binding group, J is also in that group (condition 3).\n   - M would still be in at least one group (condition 4).\n   - There would still be at least one common employee (M) in both groups (condition 5).\n6. K cannot replace L in the printing group because then there would be no common employee in both groups, violating condition (5).\nTherefore, the only member that K can replace without violating any conditions is H.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
