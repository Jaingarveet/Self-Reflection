        "content": "To determine which choice supports the argument in the question stem, let's break down the main points:\n1. Right and wrong are distinct from whether they violate rules or regulations.\n2. Some regulations may prohibit things that are not inherently wrong.\n3. Some regulations may require things that are inherently wrong.\n4. We can evaluate the prescribed right and wrong, similar to evaluating behavior.\nNow, let's examine each choice:\nA. This choice questions how we can judge right and wrong without pre-existing regulations or standards. This weakens the argument by implying that right and wrong are dependent on regulations.\nB. This choice suggests that failure to follow ethical regulations will lead to divine punishment. This is not directly related to the argument and does not support it.\nC. This choice states that judgments of right and wrong are always based on rules or standards. This weakens the argument by suggesting that right and wrong are inseparable from regulations.\nD. This choice asserts that the basis for judging right and wrong lies in one's moral conscience, which is common and universal, while acknowledging that moral regulations vary across individuals and places. This supports the argument by distinguishing between the universal basis for judging right and wrong (moral conscience) and the varying regulations that prescribe how to act.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
