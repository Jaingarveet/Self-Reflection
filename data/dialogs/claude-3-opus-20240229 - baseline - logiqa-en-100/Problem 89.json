(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\n"

Since J is a child, if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat an adult male patient (E or F).\n2. Dr. Li can only treat 1 patient. This leaves 6 patients for the other 3 doctors.\n3. If a doctor treats a child patient (J or K), they must also treat an adult patient of the same sex. J is male and K is female.\n4. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A. There is no patient F mentioned in the context, so this cannot be determined.\n   B. There is no patient C mentioned in the context, so this cannot be determined.\n   C. It's possible that Dr. Zhang treats J and either E or F, but it's not a certainty based on the given conditions.\n   D. H is an adult female patient. If Dr. Wang treats the female child patient K, then he must also treat an adult female patient, which could be H. However, it's not a certainty based on the given conditions.\nNone of the answer choices can be definitively determined as true based on the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
