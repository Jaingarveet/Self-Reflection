This could contribute to the gap between statistics and people's perceptions.\nB: The CPI is an overall average, which may not fully capture individual experiences or regional differences. This could explain why people's feelings differ from the national average.\nC: If prices are rising more for essential goods that people frequently purchase, this could make price increases feel more significant to individuals, even if the overall CPI increase is moderate.\nD: High-income groups being less sensitive to small price increases does not directly explain why there is a gap between the CPI statistics and the feelings of the general population. The CPI is an average across all income levels, so the perceptions of high-income groups alone do not account for the discrepancy.\nTherefore, choice D is the only option that does not help explain the gap between the CPI statistics and people's feelings.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
