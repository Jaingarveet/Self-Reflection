However, it doesn't directly address the increase in posts or the conclusion about the deteriorating social atmosphere. It doesn't significantly weaken the argument.\nB: If the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, it could explain the increase in both types of posts without necessarily indicating a deteriorating social atmosphere. A larger user base could lead to more posts overall, making the percentage increases less meaningful. This choice weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in posts.\nC: The existence of people using online rumors for profit doesn't directly address the types of posts mentioned or the conclusion about the social atmosphere. It introduces a tangentially related point but doesn't significantly weaken the main argument.\nD: The legal status of the online forum is not directly relevant to the increase in posts or the conclusion drawn. It doesn't provide any information that weakens the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
