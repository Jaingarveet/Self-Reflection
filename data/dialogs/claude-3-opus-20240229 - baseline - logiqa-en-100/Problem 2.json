After the first round, the remaining six players are of equal strength.\n2. In the played rounds:\n   - Chess player A defeated Chess player B\n   - Chess player B defeated Chess player C\nGiven that all players are of equal strength, the previous results don't necessarily predict the outcome of the match between A and C. While A defeated B, and B defeated C, this doesn't mean A will definitely win against C, as other factors like strategy, mental state, and even luck on the day can influence the result.\nHowever, based on the transitive property, if A > B and B > C, then it's reasonable to assume A > C. So while not guaranteed, Chess player A has a higher likelihood of winning against C.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
