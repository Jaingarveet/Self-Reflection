This implies that being careful does not necessarily mean lacking taste. Choice A contradicts this, so it cannot be derived.\nB: The passage suggests that people who respect others are not overbearing and are moral. This implies that being overbearing is associated with being immoral. Choice B aligns with this, so it can be derived.\nC: The passage states that people who respect nature do not plunder, allowing for a sustainable life. This implies that plundering nature leads to unsustainable life. Choice C aligns with this, so it can be derived.\nD: The passage does not directly link immorality with being overbearing and careful. While it suggests that being overbearing is associated with immorality, it does not mention a connection between immorality and being careful. Choice D introduces a new relationship not clearly supported by the passage, so it cannot be derived.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
