Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nThought: \nThe passage states that the specific proteins responsible for cat allergies vary from person to person.\nThis implies that different cats will trigger allergies in different people.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the variability of individual allergies rather than the variability of cat proteins. While it's true that different people react to different proteins, the passage emphasizes that **not all cats have the same protein composition in their skin and saliva**. This directly implies that **cats themselves differ in their allergy-triggering potential**.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the focus of the passage, emphasizing individual allergies instead of cat protein variability.\n* **Overgeneralization:** I overgeneralized the statement about individual allergies to conclude that all cats are equally allergenic.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the key point:** The passage highlights the **variation in protein composition among cats**.\n2. **Analyze the answer choices:** Only option C directly reflects this variation.\n3. **Eliminate other options:**\n    * A: This might be true, but the passage doesn't provide evidence.\n    * B: While true, it's a weaker statement than C, which directly addresses the protein variation.\n    * D: The passage doesn't discuss the intensity of reactions.\n    * E: This is true due to individual differences, but not the main point.\n## Instructions for Future:\n1. **Focus on the main point of the passage, not just specific details.**\n2. **Carefully analyze each answer choice and eliminate those that don't directly address the key point.**\n3. **Consider the scope of the information provided and avoid making assumptions beyond the text.**\n## General Advice:\n* **Read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.**\n* **Identify the key issue or question being addressed.**\n* **Analyze each answer choice critically and eliminate those that are irrelevant or contradict the information.**\n* **Don't rush to answer; take your time to understand the context and implications.**\n* **Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.** \n"
