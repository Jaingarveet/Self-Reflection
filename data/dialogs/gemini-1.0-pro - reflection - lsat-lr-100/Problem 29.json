It is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. Therefore, consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are thereby behaving rationally.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information.\n  B: Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.\n  C: The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  D: Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  E: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\nThought: \nThe argument states that consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase are behaving rationally.\nThe conclusion is based on the assumption that it is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\nOption A states that rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information. This aligns with the argument's premise.\nOption B states that whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.
