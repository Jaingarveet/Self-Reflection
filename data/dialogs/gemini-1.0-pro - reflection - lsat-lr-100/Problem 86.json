Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\n\nThought:\nThe information provided states that the rate at which cabin air is replenished in commercial airliners has decreased since 1985. This suggests that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air has increased since 1985.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

However, the information provided does not state that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is replenished.\nError Keywords:\n - Assumption error\n - Causal reasoning error\n - Proportional reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe information provided states that the rate at which cabin air is replenished in commercial airliners has decreased since 1985. This suggests that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air has increased since 1985.\nThe information provided also states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. This suggests that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\nHowever, the information provided does not state that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is replenished. Therefore, I cannot conclude that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower in 1980 than it is today on a similar flight.\nInstructions:\n1.
