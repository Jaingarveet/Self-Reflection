Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\n\nThought: \nThe argument states that smokers are more likely to quit if their doctor exaggerates the dangers of smoking. This implies that people are more likely to change their behavior if they believe the risks are greater than they actually are.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the aspect of exaggerating the dangers and overlooked the crucial role of self-deception in the argument. \n## Error Keywords:\n* **Overlooking key element:** Failing to consider all aspects of the argument.\n* **Misinterpreting implication:** Mistakenly assuming that a stated consequence implies a specific cause.\n* **Ignoring context:** Not fully considering the context and purpose of the argument.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the main claim:** Smokers are more likely to quit if their doctor exaggerates the dangers of smoking.\n2. **Analyze the supporting statement:** This implies that exaggerating the risks can motivate people to change their behavior.\n3. **Consider the role of self-deception:** The argument hinges on the idea that individuals need to believe the exaggerated claims to be true in order for them to be effective.\n4. **Evaluate the answer choices:** Only option D directly addresses the necessity of self-deception in the argument.\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully read the argument and identify the main claim and supporting statements.\n2. Analyze the implications of the argument and consider all potential factors involved.\n3. Pay close attention to the role of assumptions and how they contribute to the argument's logic.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the identified assumptions and the overall argument structure.\n5. Choose the answer that most accurately reflects the underlying assumption(s) of the argument.\n## General Advice:\n* **Read actively and critically:** Don't just skim the surface; engage with the text and analyze its meaning.\n* **Break down complex arguments:** Divide the argument into smaller, more manageable components.\n* **Identify assumptions:** Recognize the underlying assumptions that support the argument.\n* **Consider alternative perspectives:** Think about different interpretations and potential counter-arguments.\n* **Be mindful of your own biases:** Be aware of your own preconceptions and how they might influence your understanding. \n"
