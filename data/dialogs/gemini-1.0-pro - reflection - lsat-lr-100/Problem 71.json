Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\nQuestion: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.\n  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.\n  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\n\nThought: \nThe curator says that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.\nThe curator also says that prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.\nThe curator also says that the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\nFrom this, we can infer that:\n* Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. (This is because the curator says that prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.)\n* Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. (This is because the curator says that the museum displays only twentieth-century works.)\n* There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.

(This is because the curator says that the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.)\n* Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the curator's statement about prints being available in the museum store meant that prints of all works displayed in the museum were available. However, the curator only stated that prints of works in the museum's permanent collection were available.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Incomplete information error\n- Overgeneralization error\nSolution:\n1. Identify the key facts from the curator's statements:\n    - The museum displays only twentieth-century works.\n    - These works are either on loan or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n    - Prints of works in the permanent collection are available in the store.\n    - The store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Nighthawks.\n2. Analyze the answer choices based on these facts:\n    - A is incorrect because the store may sell prints of works not in the permanent collection.\n    - B is incorrect because the store might sell prints of works not displayed in the museum.\n    - C is correct because the curator guarantees prints for all non-loaned displayed works.\n    - D is incorrect; the curator doesn't confirm Nighthawks is on loan.\n    - E is incorrect; Nighthawks could be a non-20th-century work displayed on loan.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and identify key facts from the provided context.\n2. Analyze each answer choice individually, considering all provided information.\n3. Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions beyond the explicitly stated facts.\n4. If unsure, eliminate obviously wrong choices first and carefully analyze remaining options.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to details and qualifiers in the provided information.\n- Distinguish between facts, assumptions, and inferences.\n- Consider all answer choices systematically, eliminating those contradicted by the facts.\n- When unsure, focus on identifying the most likely or definitively true option."
