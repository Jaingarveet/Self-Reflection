Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes once the company moves to Ocean View. This implies that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the change in commute times and overlooked the crucial information about housing affordability. The argument hinges on the assumption that most employees **cannot afford** housing near Ocean View, implying that they will be forced to endure longer commutes. \n## Error Keywords:\n* **Overlooking crucial information:** I failed to consider the full context of the housing affordability issue.\n* **Misinterpreting the implication:** I mistakenly inferred that shorter commutes were currently the norm, instead of focusing on the future impact of relocation.\n* **Logical fallacy:** My reasoning committed the \"false cause\" fallacy by assuming that the move itself would cause longer commutes, without considering the underlying factor of housing affordability.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the conclusion:** The argument concludes that most Acme employees will have longer commutes after the relocation.\n2. **Analyze the evidence:** The evidence provided is that most employees cannot afford housing near Ocean View.\n3. **Identify the missing assumption:** The argument assumes that employees will choose to live within a 30-minute commute of their workplace, even if they cannot afford housing there.\n4. **Evaluate the answer choices:** Only option E aligns with this assumption. It states that the move will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise, implying that employees' financial constraints will remain unchanged.\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully read the argument and identify the conclusion.\n2. Analyze the evidence provided and identify any gaps in information.\n3. Consider what additional assumptions are needed to bridge the gap between evidence and conclusion.\n4. Evaluate the answer choices based on the identified assumptions and choose the one that best aligns with them.\n5. Be mindful of potential logical fallacies and ensure your reasoning is sound.\n## General Advice:\n* **Pay close attention to keywords and qualifiers:** Words like \"most,\" \"cannot afford,\" and \"significant\" carry important meaning and should not be overlooked.\n* **Consider the context and background information:** Understand the broader situation and how it relates to the specific argument being presented.\n* **Don't jump to conclusions:** Base your reasoning on solid evidence and logical inferences, avoiding assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n* **Evaluate answer choices carefully:** Analyze each option in relation to the identified assumptions and choose the one that best fits the overall argument.\n* **Practice critical thinking skills:** Regularly engage in exercises that challenge your reasoning and ability to identify logical fallacies. \n"
