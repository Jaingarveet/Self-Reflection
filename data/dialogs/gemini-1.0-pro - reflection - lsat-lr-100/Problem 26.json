        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\n\nThought: \nThe passage states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nTherefore, any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

Identify the key features of horror stories as described in the passage.\n2. Identify the specific feature that is being discussed in the question.\n3. Consider whether the feature being discussed is exclusive to horror stories.\n4. Identify other types of stories that may also exhibit the feature being discussed.\n5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the relationship between the feature and the types of stories that exhibit it.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully and identify the key features of the types of stories being discussed.\n2. Read the question carefully and identify the specific feature that is being asked about.\n3.
