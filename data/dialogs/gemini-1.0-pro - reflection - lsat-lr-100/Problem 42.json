Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: When a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose \"unyielding,\" because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above?\nChoices:\n  A: rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact\n  B: rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  C: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives\n  D: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question\n  E: conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion\n\nThought: \nThe argumentative technique employed above is to reject a factic on the grounds that it makes it virtually impossible for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly identified the argumentative technique employed in the passage. \nMy error stemmed from a misunderstanding of the concept of \"factic\" and the overall argument's structure.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding of \"factic\"\n - Misinterpretation of argument structure\n - Incorrect identification of argumentative technique\nSolution:\nThe passage argues that accusing group members of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding is unhelpful because it is difficult to prove and rarely helps the group reach a resolution. \nHowever, the passage suggests that if one wants to make such an accusation stick, they should use the term \"unyielding\" because it is undeniable that someone who has not yielded is, in fact, unyielding. \nThis conditional advocacy of a specific term is based on the idea that it provides a more logically sound and less offensive argument.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the passage and identify the main argument.\n2. Identify the specific argumentative technique being used.\n3. Consider the context and purpose of the argument.\n4. Analyze the reasoning and logic used in the argument.\n5. Evaluate the validity and soundness of the argument.\n6. Identify any potential biases or fallacies.\n7. Choose the answer that most accurately reflects the argumentative technique employed.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the meaning and usage of key terms.\n- Carefully analyze the structure and logic of the argument.\n- Consider the context and purpose of the argument.\n- Be aware of potential biases and fallacies.\n- Choose the answer that best reflects the argumentative technique used.\n- In this specific case, remember that a \"factic\" is a statement of fact, and the argument is not rejecting a fact but rather suggesting a specific way to frame an accusation. \n- Additionally, the argument is not primarily concerned with helping the group reach a consensus but rather with making a logically sound and less offensive accusation."
