Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

But you're already unhappy, so you might as well just quit.\nQuestion: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it\nChoices:\n  A: fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance\n  B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true\n  C: mischaracterize what Brooks says\n  D: conllates two different types of risk\n  E: reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case\n\nThought: \nMorgenstern's argument is flawed because it assumes that the only risk in quitting is not finding another job. This is a false dilemma because there are other risks involved in quitting, such as the risk of not being able to find a job that pays as well as your current job, the risk of not being able to find a job that you enjoy as much as your current job, and the risk of not being able to find a job that is located in a place that you want to live.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Identify the main argument being made.\n2. Analyze the underlying assumptions of the argument.\n3. Determine whether the assumptions are valid or flawed.\n4. Consider alternative possibilities and potential consequences.\n5. Evaluate the argument's overall strength and validity based on its assumptions and potential outcomes.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the structure of arguments and identify any underlying assumptions.\n - Evaluate the validity of assumptions and consider alternative possibilities.\n - Recognize that arguments can be flawed even if they contain some element of truth.\n - Be cautious of arguments that oversimplify complex issues or present false dilemmas.\n - Consider the potential consequences of different courses of action before making a decision."
