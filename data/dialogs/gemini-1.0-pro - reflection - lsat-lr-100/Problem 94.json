Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\nQuestion: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.\n  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.\n  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.\n  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.\n\nThought: \nThe argument in the context is a syllogism with the following structure:\n* Premise 1: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience.\n* Premise 2: Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.\n* Conclusion: Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\nThe conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\nLet's analyze the answer choices:\nA: This argument also commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints does not follow logically from the premises.\nB: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that few birds remain in this region during the winter follows logically from the premises.\nC: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars does not follow logically from the premises.\nD: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring does not follow logically from the premises.\nE: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer follows logically from the premises.\nTherefore, the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in the argument in choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
