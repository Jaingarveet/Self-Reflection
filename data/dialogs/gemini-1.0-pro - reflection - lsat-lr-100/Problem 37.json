Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Smith's statements can most directly be used as part of an argument for which one of the following views?\nChoices:\n  A: A democratic government does not infringe on the rights of any of its citizens.\n  B: Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.\n  C: News programs for children would give them enough information to enable them to vote in an informed way.\n  D: If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted.\n  E: If parents do not adequately represent their children's interests in the political sphere, those interests will be adequately represented by someone else.\n\nError: The model response did not completed successfully.\nFinish reason: 3.\nFinish message: .\nSafety ratings: [category: HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH\nprobability: LOW\nprobability_score: 0.580233157\nseverity: HARM_SEVERITY_LOW\nseverity_score: 0.286268979\n, category: HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT\nprobability: NEGLIGIBLE\nprobability_score: 0.0725052506\nseverity: HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE\nseverity_score: 0.093678\n, category: HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT\nprobability: MEDIUM\nprobability_score: 0.747431695\nseverity: HARM_SEVERITY_MEDIUM\nseverity_score: 0.41075629\nblocked: true\n, category: HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT\nprobability: NEGLIGIBLE\nprobability_score: 0.068164371\nseverity: HARM_SEVERITY_NEGLIGIBLE\nseverity_score: 0.102664009\n].\nTo protect the integrity of the chat session, the request and response were not added to chat history.\nTo skip the response validation, specify `model.start_chat(response_validation=False)`.\nNote that letting blocked or otherwise incomplete responses into chat history might lead to future interactions being blocked by the service.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
