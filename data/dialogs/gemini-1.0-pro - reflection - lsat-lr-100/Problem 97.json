        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?\nChoices:\n  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.\n  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.\n  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.\n  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.\n  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.\n\nThought: \nThe statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is not the main conclusion of the argument.\nThe statement is not a claim that the argument tries to rebut.\nThe statement is a premise that directly supports the main conclusion of the argument.\nThe statement is not a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.\nThe statement does not provide background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Identify the main conclusion of the argument.\n2. Identify the premises that support the main conclusion.\n3. Identify the conclusions that are supported by the premises and that themselves support the main conclusion.\n4. Identify the claims that are not premises, conclusions, or supporting information.\n5. Determine the role that each claim plays in the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Carefully read the argument and identify the main conclusion.\n - Look for premises that support the main conclusion.\n - Look for conclusions that are supported by the premises and that themselves support the main conclusion.\n - Identify claims that are not premises, conclusions, or supporting information.\n - Determine the role that each claim plays in the argument.\n - Be aware of the different types of arguments and how they are structured."
