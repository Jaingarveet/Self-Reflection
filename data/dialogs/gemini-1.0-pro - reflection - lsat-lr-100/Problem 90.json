Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\n\n## Analysis:\nThe passage describes how the presence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere can be used to distinguish between stars and brown dwarfs. \n* **Stars with mass equal to or greater than the Sun:** \n    * Have incomplete mixing in their nuclear furnaces, leaving lithium in their atmospheres.\n* **Stars with less mass than the Sun:** \n    * Have complete mixing in their nuclear furnaces, consuming all lithium.\n* **Brown dwarfs:** \n    * Do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces, so their lithium remains unconsumed.\n## Evaluating the choices:\n* **A:** Incorrect. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun also lack lithium.\n* **B:** Correct. The presence of lithium indicates incomplete mixing, which is characteristic of stars with mass equal to or greater than the Sun.\n* **C:** Incorrect. Brown dwarfs, which have lithium, are less massive than stars.\n* **D:** Incorrect. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun also have lithium.\n* **E:** Incorrect. Brown dwarfs, which are less massive than stars, have lithium.\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Explanation:\nMy initial analysis of the passage and answer choices was correct. However, I made a critical error in evaluating answer choice C. I mistakenly focused on the statement \"No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf,\" without considering the broader context of the passage. \n## Error Keywords:\n* Contextual error\n* Misinterpretation\n* Overlooking information\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the key points from the passage:**\n    * Lithium presence indicates incomplete mixing in a star's nuclear furnace.\n    * Stars with mass equal to or greater than the Sun have incomplete mixing and lithium.\n    * Stars with less mass than the Sun have complete mixing and no lithium.\n    * Brown dwarfs have no fully functional nuclear furnace and retain lithium.\n2. **Analyze each answer choice:**\n    * **A:** Incorrect. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun also lack lithium.\n    * **B:** Correct. The presence of lithium indicates incomplete mixing, which is characteristic of stars with mass equal to or greater than the Sun.\n    * **C:** Correct. The passage explicitly states that brown dwarfs, which have lithium, are less massive than stars. This makes C the most strongly supported statement.\n    * **D:** Incorrect. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun also have lithium.\n    * **E:** Incorrect. Brown dwarfs, which are less massive than stars, have lithium.\n## Instructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the passage, paying close attention to the context and relationships between different elements.\n2. Identify the key points and arguments presented in the passage.\n3. Analyze each answer choice thoroughly, considering all relevant information from the passage.\n4. Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that are not explicitly supported by the passage.\n5. Double-check your analysis and reasoning before selecting your final answer.\n## General Advice:\n* **Active reading:** Engage with the text, annotate, and summarize key points.\n* **Contextual awareness:** Consider the broader context and relationships between different elements in the passage.\n* **Thorough analysis:** Evaluate each answer choice carefully, considering all relevant information.\n* **Avoid assumptions:** Do not make assumptions or draw conclusions that are not explicitly supported by the text.\n* **Double-check:** Review your analysis and reasoning before making your final selection. \n"
