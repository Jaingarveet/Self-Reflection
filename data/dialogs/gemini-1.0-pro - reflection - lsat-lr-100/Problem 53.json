This argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes a condition that is sufficient for the conclusion to be true (displaying the items is the only way of making them available to the public) as one that is necessary for the conclusion to be true (the museum did not waste its money).\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
