Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either\nChoices:\n  A: F or else K\n  B: F or else M\n  C: K or else M\n  D: M or else Q\n  E: P or else Q\n\nThought: \nIf both G and H are selected, then F is excluded due to the condition that at least one scientist of each type must be included. This means that K and M are also excluded (as F, K, and M cannot be on the panel together).\nAs K and M are not selected, there are no restrictions on P and R, so the panel may include either P or Q.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the condition \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected\" as implying that M, P, and R formed a package deal that could be added or removed from the panel as a group. I overlooked that this condition is triggered only when M is selected. Since M was not selected in the given scenario, this condition is irrelevant. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Condition misinterpretation\n- Logical error\n\nSolution: Given that G and H are selected, we can deduce the following:\n- F cannot be selected due to the condition that at least one scientist of each type must be included. \n- K cannot be selected due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.\n- Therefore, the panel must include either F or K to satisfy the conditions. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions in the question.\n2. Understand the implications of the given conditions on the panel composition.\n3. Analyze the impact of selecting G and H on the possible selections for F, K, and M.\n4. Determine which scientists must be included or excluded based on the given conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that aligns with your deductions.\n\nAdvice:\n- Carefully read and understand all the given conditions.\n- Identify the key scientists mentioned in each condition and their relationships.\n- Consider the impact of each condition individually and in combination.\n- Systematically apply the conditions to deduce the implications for panel composition.\n- Avoid making assumptions or inferences that are not directly supported by the given conditions."
