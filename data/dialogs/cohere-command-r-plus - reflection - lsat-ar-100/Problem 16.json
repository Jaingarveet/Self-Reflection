Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?\nChoices:\n  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia\n  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca\n  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa\n  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan\n  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin\n\nThought: \nThe choices provided do not fully adhere to the given constraints.\nHowever, choice D comes the closest to satisfying the conditions.\n\nChoice D satisfies the constraints that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, and that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\nIt also ensures that Julio's session is held earlier in the week than Olivia's.\nThe only constraint not met is that Lan and Olivia should not lead sessions on the same day.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.\n2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.\n3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n4. Julio's session must be held earlier in the week than Olivia's.\n\nEvaluating the choices:\nChoice A: Violates the Lan-Olivia constraint.\nChoice B: Violates the Kevin-Rebecca and Julio-Olivia constraints.\nChoice C: Violates the Kevin-Rebecca and Julio-Olivia constraints.\nChoice D: Violates the Lan-Olivia constraint.\nChoice E: Satisfies all constraints.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify and list all the constraints provided in the question.\n2. Carefully read and understand each of the choices.\n3. Evaluate each choice against all the constraints.\n4. Eliminate choices that violate any of the constraints.\n5. Select the choice that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to all the given constraints and conditions.\n- Create a systematic approach to evaluating each choice against every constraint.\n- Be meticulous in your analysis to avoid overlooking any relevant information.\n- Double-check your interpretation of the constraints to ensure you fully understand the conditions.\n- Take your time and avoid rushing through the evaluation process."
