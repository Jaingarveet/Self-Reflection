Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\n\nThought: \nThe question states that at least two books are placed on each shelf and that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n\nIf G is placed on the top shelf, then the middle shelf must have more than two books to satisfy the conditions given.\n\nTherefore, the only possible answer is:\n  C: H, I, L\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation: \nI overlooked the condition that \"K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\" \nThis condition eliminates the option where I, K, and L are on the middle shelf because it would mean K is on the same shelf as F, contradicting the given condition. \nError Keywords:\n - Oversight\n - Condition oversight\n - Contradiction oversight\nSolution: \nGiven conditions: \n- At least two books on each shelf\n- More books on the bottom shelf than the top\n- I is on the middle shelf\n- K is on a higher shelf than F\n- O is on a higher shelf than L\n- F and M are on the same shelf\n\nIf G is placed on the top shelf, we know that the middle shelf must have at least two books, and K and F cannot be on the same shelf. \n\nThe only option that satisfies all conditions is: \n- I, K, and L are on the middle shelf (D)\n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the given conditions and rules. \n2. Understand the question: If G is on the top shelf, which books could be on the middle shelf? \n3. For each choice, assess if it satisfies all conditions. \n4. Eliminate choices that contradict any condition. \n5. Choose the answer that remains viable after this process. \n\nAdvice: \n - Always read and re-read the conditions and rules to ensure you don't miss any. \n - Break down complex conditions into simpler ones. \n - Understand the implications of each condition and how they relate to each other. \n - For shelf-organization questions, visualize the placement and consider all relationships between books and shelves. \n - Double-check each choice against every condition to avoid oversights."
