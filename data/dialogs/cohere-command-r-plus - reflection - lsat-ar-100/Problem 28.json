Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\n\nThought: \nGiven F and K cannot be selected together, and F is selected, K cannot be the fifth scientist.\n\nThe panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botany, chemistry, zoology). We already have a botanist (F) and a zoologist (Q). Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a chemist.\n\nOf the three chemists, we are left with only one option, which is L. This is because, if M was selected, P would have to be selected too, but P is not part of the given selection.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the condition \"if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\" I thought this meant that all three of them (M, P, and R) must be present, but it actually meant that M's presence dictates P and R's presence, regardless of other selections. This led me to incorrectly eliminate M as a possibility and choose B instead of the correct answer, E. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Condition misinterpretation\n- Logical error\n\nSolution: \nGiven the conditions: \n- F and K cannot both be selected.\n- K and M cannot both be selected.\n- If M is selected, P and R must also be selected.\n- The panel must include at least one of each type of scientist.\n- If more than one botanist is selected, then no more than one zoologist is selected. \n\nWe are provided with four selected scientists: F, L, Q, and R. \n\nF is a botanist, so we already have one botanist on the panel. Q is a zoologist, so we have one zoologist as well. This leaves the chemist position to be filled by either K or L, as M cannot be selected without also selecting P and R, which would result in two zoologists (Q and R) and violate the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the fifth scientist selected must be P, as they complete the required trio of P, M, and R, and L does not have any selection restrictions. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the given selected scientists.\n2. Identify the types of scientists on the panel based on the provided conditions and selections. \n3. Determine the restrictions and relationships between the scientists' types. \n4. Analyze the impact of the provided selections on the conditions. \n5. Identify which conditions are already satisfied by the provided selections. \n6. Determine which scientist must be selected to satisfy the remaining conditions. \n7. Ensure that your selected scientist does not violate any conditions. \n\nAdvice: \n- Read and understand all the conditions and their implications before making a decision. \n- Identify the types of scientists involved and their relationships based on the conditions. \n- Carefully interpret the conditions, especially those with multiple clauses, to understand their individual and combined impacts. \n- Consider all provided selections and their implications on the conditions. \n- Ensure that your selected scientist satisfies all necessary conditions without violating any restrictions."
