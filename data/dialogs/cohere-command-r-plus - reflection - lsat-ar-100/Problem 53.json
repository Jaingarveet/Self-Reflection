        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: K is shown in the evening.\n  B: L is shown in the afternoon.\n  C: L is shown in the evening.\n  D: M is shown in the morning.\n  E: M is shown in the afternoon.\n\nThought: \nFrom the rules, we know that J must be shown in the evening and that K cannot be shown in the morning. \nThis means that J and K must be shown in either the afternoon or evening. \nAs L must be shown after K, this means that L must be shown in the afternoon or evening as well. \nTherefore, the correct answer is that L must be shown in the afternoon or evening (choice C).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the rule regarding the showing order of houses L and M. I focused on L being shown after K but overlooked the requirement that L must also be shown before M. This led me to consider only the relative order of K and L, neglecting the constraint imposed by M. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Neglect of constraints\n\nSolution: \nThe given rules and constraints are as follows: \n- J must be shown in the evening. \n- K cannot be shown in the morning. \n- L must be shown after K and before M. \n\nFrom these rules, we can deduce the following: \n- J is shown in the evening, which is the only option for its showing time. \n- K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. \n- L must be shown after K, which narrows down its options to the afternoon or evening. \n- M must be shown after L. As L can only be shown in the afternoon or evening, this means that M can only be shown in the evening (after L) or afternoon (if L is shown in the evening). \n\nNow, let's consider the options: \n- A: K is shown in the evening. This is not a must; K can be shown in the afternoon, depending on the showing time of J. \n- B: L is shown in the afternoon. This must be true because L has to be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning. If K is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown afterward in the same time slot. \n- C: L is shown in the evening. This is not a must as L can also be shown in the afternoon, maintaining the relative order with K. \n- D: M is shown in the morning. This cannot be true because M can only be shown after L, and L cannot be shown in the morning due to the constraint on K. \n- E: M is shown in the afternoon. This is not a must as M can also be shown in the evening, depending on when L is shown. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: L is shown in the afternoon. \n\nInstructions: \n- Identify the given rules and constraints regarding the showing order of the houses. \n- Interpret the rules accurately, paying close attention to the specific requirements for each house. \n- Consider all the options for the showing times of J, K, and L, as they are interconnected. \n- Deduce the possible showing times for M based on the constraints imposed by L. \n- Evaluate each choice carefully, considering the must-be-true condition. \n\nAdvice: \n- Read and understand the rules and constraints carefully. \n- Break down complex rules into simpler components to facilitate understanding. \n- Consider the implications of each rule and how they interact with each other. \n- Create a logical framework that accounts for all the rules and their implications. \n- Avoid making rushed conclusions; thoroughly evaluate all options before selecting an answer. \n- Double-check your interpretation of the rules to ensure accuracy."
