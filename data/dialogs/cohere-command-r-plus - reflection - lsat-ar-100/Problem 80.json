        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\n\nThought: \nChoice B is the only option that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nYoung must be assigned a higher number than Togowa, so Young cannot be #1 or #2.\nXu must be assigned a higher number than Souza, so Xu cannot be #1, #2, or #3.\nRobertson must be assigned a higher number than Young, and between #1 and #4, so Robertson must be #4, with Young in #5 or #6.\n\nOnly option B satisfies all these conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the condition that \"Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\" I assumed that Robertson had to be assigned a number higher than Young's number, but the condition states that Robertson's space number must simply be higher than Young's, allowing for other employees in between. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Misunderstanding\n- Logical error\n\nSolution: \nStep 1: Assign Togowa and Souza to parking spaces #2 and #5, respectively, to satisfy the conditions that Xu and Young are assigned higher numbers. \nStep 2: Assign Xu a higher number than #5, which is #6. \nStep 3: Assign Young a higher number than Togowa's #2, which can be #3, #4, #5, or #6. In this case, #3 is suitable as it is higher than Togowa's #2 and satisfies the condition that Robertson is assigned a higher number. \nStep 4: Assign Robertson #4, a higher number than Young's #3, and meeting the condition that Robertson is assigned #1-#4. \nStep 5: Finally, assign Vaughn the remaining #1, as none of the conditions are violated. \n\nInstructions: \n- Identify the conditions and rules governing the parking space assignments. \n- Interpret the conditions accurately, paying attention to the specific wording. \n- Start by assigning employees with specific number requirements, such as those who must be assigned higher or lower numbers relative to each other. \n- Work through the options methodically, eliminating those that violate the conditions. \n- Double-check that all conditions are met for the chosen option. \n\nAdvice: \n- Read and understand the conditions carefully, ensuring a clear interpretation. \n- Do not make assumptions or jump to conclusions; work through each step logically. \n- Consider all conditions together, rather than in isolation, to avoid missing interactions between them. \n- Remember that the conditions must all be met simultaneously, so each option should be scrutinized thoroughly. \n- Double-check your interpretation and solution to prevent errors arising from misunderstandings."
