        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n\nThought: \nWe know that Robertson must be assigned one of the first four parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means that only two of those four spaces will be available for the other five employees.\n\nYoung must have a higher number than Togowa, so if Togowa is assigned #1, then Young could only be assigned #2, #3, or #4 (three options). If Togowa is assigned #2, then Young could only have #3 or #4 (two options). So, Young has a maximum of three options but can have as few as two, depending on the other assignments.\n\nXu must have a higher number than Souza, so they also have a maximum of three options but can have as few as two, similar to Young and Togowa.\n\nTherefore, there are three employees (Robertson, Xu, and Souza) who at most can only be assigned to two possible spaces.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the rules governing the parking space assignments, particularly the conditions related to Young, Xu, and Robertson. My mistake led me to believe that certain assignments were more restricted than they actually were. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overly restrictive interpretation\n- Rule misunderstanding\n\nSolution: \nLet's re-examine the rules and the options for each employee: \n- Robertson must be assigned one of the first four spaces (#1 to #4). This means that two of these four spaces will be taken, leaving the remaining four employees with more flexibility. \n- Young must have a higher number than Togowa. If Togowa is assigned #1, it doesn't restrict Young's options; Young could still be assigned any of the remaining five spaces (#2 to #6). \n- Xu must have a higher number than Souza, but this rule doesn't limit their options significantly. \n\nNow, let's consider Young, Xu, and Souza: \n- Young has five options if Togowa takes #1 (#2 to #6). \n- Xu has five options if Souza takes #1 or #2. \n- Souza has four options if Xu takes any space from #1 to #4. \n\nTherefore, at most, four employees (Robertson, Young, Xu, and Souza) are limited to only two possible spaces each. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the fixed starting point: Robertson must be assigned #1 to #4. \n2. Understand the conditions for Young, Xu, and Souza in relation to other employees' assignments. \n3. Consider the best-case scenario for Young, Xu, and Souza, where their options are most flexible. \n4. Count the number of employees with limited options. \n\nAdvice: \n- Understand the rules and conditions thoroughly. Ensure you interpret \"must be higher/lower\" as providing flexibility rather than strict limitations. \n- Consider the most flexible scenarios first, as these will provide the lower bound for the number of possible options. \n- Systematically work through each employee's options, considering the impact of each possible assignment on the remaining employees."
