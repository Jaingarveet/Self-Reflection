        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\n\nThought: \nIf the veterinarian is in space 5, then according to the constraints:\n- The pharmacy must be in space 4 (as it must be next to the veterinarian and at one end of the row)\n- This means that space 1, 6, or 7 must remain empty to separate the restaurants by at least two spaces\n- The optometrist can be placed in space 2 or 3\n- The toy store cannot be in space 3 (as it would be next to the veterinarian in space 4)\n- The shoe store can be placed in space 6 or 7\n- A restaurant must go in space 1, 6, or 7\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is that a restaurant is in space 7.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the constraint regarding the separation of the restaurants and incorrectly assumed that spaces 1, 6, or 7 must remain empty. However, the constraint only states that there should be at least two other businesses between the restaurants, which means that a restaurant can indeed be in space 4 as long as the other restaurant is in space 1 or 7. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Misunderstanding\n- Logical error\n- Incomplete analysis\n\nSolution: \n\nIf the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 to fulfill the constraint of being next to each other. This means that one of the restaurants must be at the opposite end, in space 1 or 7, to satisfy the pharmacy's position and the requirement for separation between the restaurants. Therefore, it is true that a restaurant is in space 4, as it is the only option that fulfills all the constraints. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the constraints and their implications: \n    - Pharmacy and veterinarian must be next to each other. \n    - Restaurants must be at opposite ends with at least two businesses between them. \n2. Identify the fixed positions: \n    - If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4. \n3. Determine the implications for restaurant placement: \n    - With the pharmacy in space 4, one restaurant must be at the opposite end (space 1 or 7) to ensure separation. \n4. Analyze the remaining options: \n    - Space 5: Veterinarian\n    - Space 4: Pharmacy\n    - Space 3, 2, or 1: Open for other businesses\n    - Space 1 or 7: Restaurant\n5. Conclude that a restaurant in space 4 fulfills all the constraints. \n\nAdvice: \n - Read and understand all the constraints carefully. \n - Identify the fixed positions and their implications for the remaining spaces. \n - Consider all possibilities and test them against the constraints. \n - Ensure your interpretation of the constraints is consistent and logical. \n - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions; always validate your reasoning. \n - Practice similar spatial reasoning and logic problems to improve your analytical skills."
