The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices:\n  A: 5(√3 + 1)\n  B: 6(√3 + √2)\n  C: 7(√3 – 1)\n  D: 8(√3 – 2)\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from a mistake in calculating the time taken to cover the remaining distance. I incorrectly substituted the value of 'h' in the equation for time, leading to the wrong answer.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Calculation error\n*   Algebraic manipulation error\n*   Substitution error\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Set up equations:** As before, we have `tan 60° = h/y`, `tan 45° = h/x`, leading to `y = h/√3` and `x = h`.\n2.  **Distance covered:** The distance covered in 10 minutes is `x - y = h(1 - 1/√3)`.\n3.  **Time equation:** We know `distance = speed × time`. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance y is `time = distance/speed = y/v = (h/√3)/v`.\n4.  **Relate time and distance:** We need to express the time in terms of the known 10 minutes. We know `10 minutes = h(1 - 1/√3)/v`. Solving for v, we get `v = h(1 - 1/√3) / 10`.\n5.  **Substitute and solve:** Substitute the value of v in the time equation: `time = (h/√3) / (h(1 - 1/√3) / 10)`. Simplifying, we get `time = 10 / (√3 - 1)`.\n6.  **Rationalize the denominator:** Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: `time = 10(√3 + 1) / ((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))`. This simplifies to `time = 5(√3 + 1) minutes`.\n## Instructions for Future\n1.  **Carefully set up equations based on the given information and trigonometric relationships.**\n2.  **Clearly define variables and maintain consistent notation throughout the solution.**\n3.  **Double-check all algebraic manipulations and substitutions to avoid errors.**\n4.  **Pay close attention to units and ensure consistency in calculations.**\n5.  **Rationalize denominators when necessary to simplify expressions.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Draw diagrams:** Visualizing the problem can aid in understanding and setting up equations.\n*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.\n*   **Review trigonometry fundamentals:** Ensure a solid understanding of trigonometric ratios and identities.\n*   **Practice similar problems:** Regular practice improves problem-solving skills and accuracy.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze errors to avoid repeating them in the future.\n"
