        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.\nChoices:\n  A: 238\n  B: 289\n  C: 200\n  D: 287\n  E: 187\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the total distance covered by both the ship and the plane was the sum of the ship's initial distance and the further distance it traveled. Instead, the total distance should only represent the distance from the starting point to the meeting point, which is the same for both the ship and the plane.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation\n*   Problem-solving strategy\n*   Distance calculation\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Define variables:** Let x be the distance traveled by both the ship and plane when they meet.\n2.  **Set up equation based on time:** Since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship, the time it takes for them to meet is the same. Therefore, we can equate the time taken by each: \n    *   Time taken by ship = x / (speed of ship)\n    *   Time taken by plane = (x - 180) / (10 * speed of ship)\n3.  **Equate the time equations and solve for x:**\n    *   x / (speed of ship) = (x - 180) / (10 * speed of ship)\n    *   Solving for x, we get x = 200 miles.\n**Instructions for Future Similar Problems:**\n1.  **Carefully read and understand the problem:** Pay close attention to what the problem is asking for and avoid making assumptions.\n2.  **Identify the key information and variables:** Clearly define what each variable represents in the context of the problem.\n3.  **Set up equations based on the relationships between variables:** Use the given information and relevant formulas to establish mathematical relationships.\n4.  **Solve the equations step-by-step:** Show your work clearly and double-check each step to avoid errors.\n5.  **Interpret the solution in the context of the problem:** Ensure that your answer makes sense and addresses the original question.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Practice active reading:** When solving word problems, actively engage with the text and visualize the scenario.\n*   **Draw diagrams:** Visual representations can help clarify the problem and identify relationships between variables.\n*   **Check for reasonableness:** Once you have an answer, consider whether it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze your errors to understand where you went wrong and avoid repeating them in the future.\n"
