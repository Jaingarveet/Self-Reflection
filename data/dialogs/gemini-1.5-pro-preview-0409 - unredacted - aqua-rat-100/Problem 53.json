But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nWhile the algebraic approach and equations were set up correctly, there might have been an error during the solving process, leading to the incorrect values for A and S.  Double-checking the calculations is crucial in such problems.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Algebraic manipulation error\n*   Equation solving error\n*   Calculation error\n## Solving the Problem\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Set up equations:**\n    *   Equation 1: \\(2(A-30) = S+30\\)\n    *   Equation 2: \\(3(S-10) = A+10\\)\n2.  **Solve Equation 1 for S:** \n    *   \\(S = 2A - 90\\)\n3.  **Substitute S in Equation 2:**\n    *   \\(3(2A-90-10) = A+10\\)\n    *   \\(6A - 300 = A + 10\\)\n4.  **Solve for A:**\n    *   \\(5A = 310\\)\n    *   \\(A = 62\\)\n5.  **Substitute A in the equation for S:**\n    *   \\(S = 2(62) - 90\\)\n    *   \\(S = 34\\)\nTherefore, Arjun has **$62** and Sajal has **$34**.\n## Instructions for Future\n1.  **Define variables:** Assign variables to the unknowns in the problem.\n2.  **Set up equations:** Translate the given information into algebraic equations.\n3.  **Solve the system of equations:** Use substitution or elimination methods to find the values of the variables.\n4.  **Check the solution:** Ensure the solution satisfies both original equations and the problem's context.\n5.  **Review calculations:** Double-check all calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.\n## General Advice\n*   **Practice algebra skills:** Regularly practice solving equations and systems of equations.\n*   **Break down problems:** Divide complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n*   **Focus on accuracy:** Pay close attention to detail and avoid careless mistakes.\n*   **Use different methods:** Explore various algebraic techniques to find the most efficient approach.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze errors to understand the cause and prevent them in the future.\n"
