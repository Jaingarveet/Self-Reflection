Since the processing of cotton fiber does not release environmentally harmful gases, there would be less environmental damage done if cotton fiber rather than nylon were used to make products such as thread and rope.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would weaken the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Even if the quantity of nitrous oxide released into the environment decreased, many environmental problems would remain unsolved.\n  B: Even if only some of the thread and rope that is currently being made from nylon were instead made from cotton fiber, some environmental damage would be avoided.\n  C: If cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products.\n  D: If the quantity of nylon manufactured annually decreased substantially, the volume of several pollutants that are released into the environment during its manufacture would be reduced.\n  E: If thread and rope continue to be made from nylon, the production of cotton fiber will not increase as rapidly as it would if all thread and rope were to be made from cotton fiber.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Consider all the potential impacts of a solution before advocating for it.\n* Be aware of potential offsetting effects that may weaken the argument.\n* Evaluate the argument and counterargument carefully before making a decision.\n"
