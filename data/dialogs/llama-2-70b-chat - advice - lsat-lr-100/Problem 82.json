Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always pay attention to detail and ensure that answers are provided in the correct format.\n* Take the time to carefully evaluate answer choices and determine which one best addresses the objection.\n* Double-check answers to ensure accuracy and avoid simple mistakes.\n"

Tamara's objection argues that wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas. Choice B states that ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound, which would make the squeaky floors ineffective in detecting them. Therefore, B is the strongest counter to Tamara's objection.\n\nIn the future, I will pay attention to detail and ensure that my answers are in the correct format. I will also double-check my answers to avoid simple mistakes."
