Let's try again.\nTopic: Law\nContext: Peter: Unlike in the past, most children's stories nowadays don't have clearly immoral characters in them. They should, though. Children need to learn the consequences of being bad. Yoko: Children's stories still tend to have clearly immoral characters in them, but now these characters tend not to be the sort that frighten children.

The main issue is whether the stories should have clearly immoral characters or not.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nChoice D aligns with the main issue of the question, which is whether today's children's stories should have clearly immoral characters. Peter thinks they should, while Yoko thinks they still do but are not as frightening. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nDouble-checking, we can see that the question asks about Peter and Yoko's disagreement, and choice D accurately reflects their disagreement over the presence of clearly immoral characters in children's stories.\n\nPlugging the answer back into the original question, we get: \"Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories tend to have clearly immoral characters in them.\" This accurately reflects the given information and the main issue of the question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed D."
