Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

I thought the question was asking about the most effective strategy for breaking a habit, when in fact it was asking about an assumption that the argument depends on.\n\nThe correct answer is C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n\nThe argument assumes that exaggerating the dangers of smoking will increase the likelihood that a smoker will quit. This assumption is not necessarily true, as people may react negatively to exaggerated warnings or feel that the risks are not credible. However, the argument depends on this assumption, as it suggests that doctors can help their patients break the habit of smoking by greatly exaggerating the dangers of smoking.\n\nTherefore, option C is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
