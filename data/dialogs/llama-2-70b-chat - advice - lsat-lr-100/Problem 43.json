Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always pay attention to the format of the question and the answer.\n - Make sure to understand the argument presented in the question.\n - Identify the assumptions made in the argument and use them to determine the correct answer.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure it is in the correct format.\n"

However, this assumption can be challenged by suggesting that \"love\" can refer to something else, such as a commitment or an action, that is within one's control.\nTherefore, option C is the best answer, as it provides an alternative interpretation of \"love\" that is consistent with the ethicist's conclusion.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
