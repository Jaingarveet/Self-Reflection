Let's try again.\nTopic: Law\nContext: In his book, published in 1892, Grey used the same metaphor that Jordan used in her book, which was published in 1885.

However, there are a few factors that could weaken this argument.\n\nIf a text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor, then it's possible that both authors were influenced by this earlier work, rather than Grey copying from Jordan. This would weaken the argument, so choice A is a possible answer.\n\nAnother possibility is that the passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book. If the metaphor is used in a completely different context, then it's possible that Grey came up with it independently, or that both authors were influenced by a common source. This would also weaken the argument, so choice B is another possible answer.\n\nChoice C, that both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience, doesn't seem to have much relevance to the argument.\n\nChoice D, that Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895, doesn't weaken the argument much, as it's still possible that Grey was influenced by Jordan's earlier work.\n\nFinally, choice E, that Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors, doesn't necessarily weaken the argument, as it's possible that Grey still borrowed the metaphor from Jordan, even if he was capable of coming up with original ideas.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the best answer is A, followed by B.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
