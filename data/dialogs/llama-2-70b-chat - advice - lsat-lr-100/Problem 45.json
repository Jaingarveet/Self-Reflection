Let's try again.\nTopic: Law\nContext: Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After all, cars are utilitarian things, not works of art.

The critic also states that objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. Principle B states that reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This principle supports the critic's argument that Paulsen's reviews are not criticism because cars do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. Therefore, Choice B is the correct answer.\n\nI hope this revised answer is correct. Please let me know if I need to make any further changes."
