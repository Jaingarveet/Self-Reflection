Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.\n  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument before answering.\n* Pay attention to the format of the answer and make sure to state it correctly.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it accurately reflects the main conclusion of the argument.\n"

The correct answer is indeed (\"D): Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n\nThe argument posits that people often assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but this assumption is not necessarily true. The counselor argues that personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. They tend to ascribe bad qualities to others more easily than good ones, even when there is more evidence of the latter. This means that personal conflicts can be avoided if people were to be more rational in their thinking and not jump to conclusions based on a single instance.\n\nTherefore, the main conclusion drawn from the argument is that personal conflicts are not inevitable, and it is our responsibility to be more mindful and rational in our interactions with others to avoid them.\n\nAdvice:\nAlways read the question carefully and understand the argument before answering. In this case, I misunderstood the question and selected an answer that was not the best choice.\n\nPay attention to the format of the answer and make sure to state it correctly. In this case, I did not pay attention to the format of the answer and selected a letter that was not the best choice.\n\nDouble-check your answer to ensure it accurately reflects the main conclusion of the argument. I did not double-check my answer, which resulted in my selecting an incorrect response."
