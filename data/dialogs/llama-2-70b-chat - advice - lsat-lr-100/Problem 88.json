However, upon re-reading the question, I realized that Susan is actually citing facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation. Therefore, the correct answer is choice \"B\".\n\nIn this question, Susan is responding to Yuriko's recommendation to implement a vaccination campaign in Susan's city by pointing out that the increase in vaccinations in Yuriko's city occurred mainly in the first 6 months after the legislation was enacted, and before the vaccination campaign really got going. Susan is citing facts to weaken the evidence that Yuriko uses to support her recommendation, which makes choice \"B\" the correct answer."
