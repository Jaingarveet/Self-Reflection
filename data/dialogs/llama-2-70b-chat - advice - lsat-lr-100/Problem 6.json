The conclusion is that some books published by Garden Path are flawed. However, the argument does not imply that all gardening books that recommend adding compost are flawed. Therefore, the assumption that some gardening books that recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before starting a new garden are not flawed is required for the argument to be valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: some gardening books that recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before starting a new garden are not flawed."
