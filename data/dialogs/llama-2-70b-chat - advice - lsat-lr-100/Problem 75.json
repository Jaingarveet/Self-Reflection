To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?\nChoices:\n  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.\n  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.\n  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.\n  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\n  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

I mistakenly chose option A, which is not relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nThe correct answer is option D: Environmental regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\n\nThis option aligns with the principle that environmental regulation should focus on preventing further damage to the environment, rather than allowing for different degrees of harm based on how much damage has already been done. The Figorian Development Commission argues that since other nations have already developed their wetlands, Figoria should also be allowed to do so. However, option D suggests that this line of thinking is flawed, as environmental regulation should aim to prevent further damage, regardless of how much damage has already been done.\n\nTherefore, option D strongly supports the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position, which advocates for regulating wetland development to protect wildlife, rather than allowing development to proceed unchecked.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
