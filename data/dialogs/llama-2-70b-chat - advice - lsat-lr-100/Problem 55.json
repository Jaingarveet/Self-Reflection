Here's my revised answer:\n\nTopic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.\n  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.\n  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.\n  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.\n  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.\nReflection:\nIn my previous answer, I incorrectly chose option A. However, upon reflection, I realized that option A does not necessarily lead to the conclusion of the ethicist's argument. The ethicist's argument relies on the idea that knowing more about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that the action was not freely performed. Option A only states that people should not be praised or blamed for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but it does not address the idea of free will.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. This option aligns with the ethicist's argument that we must know a lot about the events leading up to an action in order to justifiably praise or blame the person who performed it.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
