So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.\n  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.\n  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.\n  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.\n  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully read and understand the argument being made.\n* Consider the context and perspectives of the parties involved.\n* Evaluate the argument based on its logical coherence and consistency with established principles or rules.\n* Consider alternative perspectives or counterarguments that may be relevant to the issue at hand.\n* Choose the answer that most accurately describes the argument being made.\n"

Instead, Rossi's argument appeals to a general principle of democracy, which is that people should have the right to vote if their interests are not represented. This principle is the foundation of Rossi's argument, making option A the best choice.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully read and understand the argument being made.\n* Consider the context and perspectives of the parties involved.\n* Evaluate the argument based on its logical coherence and consistency with established principles or rules.\n* Consider alternative perspectives or counterarguments that may be relevant to the issue at hand.\n* Choose the answer that most accurately describes the argument being made.\n\nIn this case, Rossi's argument is based on the principle of democracy and representation, which is a fundamental concept in political philosophy and law. Therefore, option A is the best answer."
