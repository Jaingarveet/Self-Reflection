This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.\n  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.\n  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.\n  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.\n  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.\n* Identify the key information provided in the question and use it to determine the correct answer.\n* Apply the principles of logic to determine the correct answer choice.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correctly formatted.\n* Practice active reading and critical thinking to improve your ability to answer questions accurately.\n"
