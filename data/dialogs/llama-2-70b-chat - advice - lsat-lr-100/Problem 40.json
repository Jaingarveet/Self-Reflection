Let's try again.\nThe argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago because the average subscription rate has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.\nThe correct answer is choice  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.\nThis choice weakens the argument by suggesting that publishers cannot sustain consistent losses, which means that the increased subscription rates may not necessarily translate to increased profitability. It provides an alternative explanation for the increased subscription rates, which is that publishers need to cover their costs and avoid losses.\nThe other choices do not weaken the argument as much:\n\nA: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.\nThis choice does not directly address the profitability of publishing scholarly journals. It only shows that libraries are passing on the increased costs to users, which does not necessarily affect the publishers' profitability.\n\nB: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.\nThis choice does not affect the argument's conclusion either. Even if the acquisition budget is a small fraction of the total operating budget, the increased subscription rates still suggest increased profitability for publishers.\n\nD: Most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, not libraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.\nThis choice provides some contrast to the argument, but it does not directly weaken it. The argument focuses on the average subscription rate for scholarly journals, which has increased dramatically. The fact that individual subscription rates have remained unchanged does not affect the argument's conclusion.\n\nE: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.\nThis choice does not affect the argument at all. The frequency of publication does not influence the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.\n\nIn summary, choice C weakens the argument by suggesting that publishers cannot sustain consistent losses and must increase subscription rates to cover their costs. The other choices do not directly affect the argument's conclusion."
