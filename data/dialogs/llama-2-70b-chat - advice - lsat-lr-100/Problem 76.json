Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.\n  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.\n  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.\n  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.\n  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the argument carefully and understand the central idea.\n- Always read each choice carefully and understand the central idea.\n- Always compare the central idea of each choice to the argument.\n- Always choose the answer that most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument.\n- Remember that the correct answer may not always be the one that is closest to the argument, but rather the one that most closely resembles the reasoning.\n"

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I incorrectly answered this question because I failed to properly compare the central idea of each choice to the argument. I was distracted by irrelevant details and did not focus on the main point of the argument.\n\nThe argument states that adopting a healthier diet based on fish would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Therefore, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.\n\nChoice C most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument. It states that if everyone were to adopt a spending pattern of limiting purchases to what they truly need and saving or investing the rest, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.\n\nBoth the argument and Choice C present a situation where adopting a certain practice or behavior universally would lead to negative consequences, making it impossible or unfeasible. They also suggest that it is not advisable to recommend such a practice or behavior to everyone.\n\nTherefore, Action: Answer(\"C\") is the correct answer."
