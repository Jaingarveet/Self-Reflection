Let's evaluate the argument again, taking into account the new information provided.\n\nThe argument concludes that the university president's speech was not inappropriate solely based on Professor Riley's testimony that it was inflammatory. The argument relies on the premise that Riley has a long-standing feud with the president and therefore may have a biased opinion. However, this premise does not necessarily mean that Riley's claim is false.\n\nThe correct answer is E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded.\n\nThe argument assumes that Riley's animosity toward the president is not well founded, without providing sufficient evidence to support this assumption. It is possible that Riley's criticism of the president's speech is valid and not motivated by personal animosity. The argument should have considered this possibility and addressed potential counterarguments to ensure its conclusion is well supported.\n\nTherefore, the argument is flawed because it fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded, and it relies on an unproven assumption that Riley's criticism is motivated by personal bias."
