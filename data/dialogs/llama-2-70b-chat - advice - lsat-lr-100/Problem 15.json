After reevaluating the question and the given answer choices, I have realized that the correct answer is choice B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true.\n\nMorgenstern's argument assumes that the only risk in quitting a job is not finding another one, and that unhappiness in a job is the only factor to consider when deciding whether to quit. However, this assumption oversimplifies the situation and ignores other potential risks and factors that Brooks may need to consider. For example, Brooks may have financial responsibilities, family obligations, or other personal circumstances that make quitting their job without a backup plan risky.\n\nFurthermore, Morgenstern's argument implies that unhappiness is a binary state, where either Brooks is unhappy in their current job or they will be happy if they quit. In reality, unhappiness can vary in intensity and significance, and Brooks may have different levels of unhappiness in different jobs or career paths.\n\nTherefore, I have revised my answer to choice B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true. Morgenstern's argument relies on an oversimplified assumption that does not adequately address the complexities of Brooks' situation, and it ignores other potential risks and factors that Brooks may need to consider when deciding whether to quit their job."
