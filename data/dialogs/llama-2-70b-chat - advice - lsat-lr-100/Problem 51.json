I'll carefully evaluate the argument and choose the best answer.\n\nThe political scientist's argument states that decreasing voter turnout is due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems. The argument assumes that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action, which is choice A.\n\nThe argument does not provide justification for this assumption, and it ignores alternative explanations for decreasing voter turnout, such as voter apathy, disillusionment with politics, or lack of interest in the candidates or issues. The argument also infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change, which is choice C, but it does not provide evidence or justification for this claim.\n\nFurthermore, the argument undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians, which is choice D. This implies that people still believe that politicians can solve important problems, but they are not satisfied with the current politicians' ability to do so.\n\nTherefore, the reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
