This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.\n  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.\n  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.\n  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\n  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"
