Let's try again.\n\nTopic: Law\nContext: Anyone who knows Ellsworth knows that he is bursting with self-righteousness, touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation.

I assumed that Ellsworth's self-righteousness was a facade, and that he was actually unethical. However, the passage does not suggest this. In fact, it states that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices, which implies that he is genuinely self-righteous and takes offense to accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. The passage suggests that Ellsworth is self-righteous and takes offense to accusations of wrongdoing, which aligns with the expectation that self-righteous people are easily offended.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
