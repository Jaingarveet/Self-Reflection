        "content": "Explanation: \nI misinterpreted the relationship between self-righteousness and offense. I incorrectly assumed that self-righteous people are expected to be offended by suggestions of unethical behavior. However, the correct answer choice (\"E\") reflects the idea that self-righteous individuals are easily offended in general, regardless of the nature of the suggestion.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logical error\n- Assumption error\n\nSolution: \nThe correct answer is \"E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.\" \n\nThe argument concludes that Ellsworth's indignation at media accusations of unethical business practices is likely due to his self-righteous nature, which makes him sensitive to any criticism or suggestion of wrongdoing. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the conclusion drawn in the argument: Ellsworth's indignation at media accusations. \n2. Recognize the premise: Ellsworth's self-righteous nature. \n3. Understand the relationship between self-righteousness and sensitivity to criticism. \n4. Evaluate each answer choice: \n   - \"A\" is incorrect because it suggests a suspicion of underlying unethical behavior, which is not relevant to Ellsworth's reaction. \n   - \"B\" is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. \n   - \"C\" is incorrect because it focuses on hiding rather than offense. \n   - \"D\" is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion, which is based on expectations of self-righteous people's behavior. \n   - \"E\" correctly reflects the assumption that self-righteous people are expected to be easily offended, aligning with Ellsworth's reaction. \n\nAdvice: \n - Carefully read and understand the argument's conclusion and premise. \n - Identify the relationship between the given information and the conclusion. \n - Evaluate each answer choice critically, considering logical connections and assumptions. \n - Avoid making assumptions or interpretations that go beyond the given information. \n - Stay focused on the specific logical connections presented in the argument."
