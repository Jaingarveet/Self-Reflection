Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\n\nThought: \nThe argument assumes that people are more likely to be receptive to warnings about their health if they come from a doctor or third-party source, as they are more likely to believe the information and be motivated to change their habits.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Identify the argument's conclusion: Exaggerated warnings from doctors can help smokers quit.\n2. Determine the supporting evidence: Similar strategies involving deception can break habits.\n3. Recognize the gap: Individuals cannot easily employ such strategies themselves.\n4. Analyze the role of the third party: They provide external deception, filling the gap.\n5. Understand the key assumption: People generally cannot deceive themselves to break habits.\n6. Evaluate each choice: Only Choice D aligns with the identified assumption.\nAdvice:\n- Carefully identify the argument's conclusion and underlying assumptions.\n- Recognize the role of third parties in providing external deception.\n- Focus on the challenge of self-deception and the need for external influence.\n- Evaluate each choice critically, ensuring it aligns with the identified assumption.\n- Avoid surface-level interpretations and look for deeper, underlying assumptions."
