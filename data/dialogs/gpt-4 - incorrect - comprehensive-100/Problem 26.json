Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

This means the pharmacy can be in space 1 or 7, and the restaurants can be in space 1 or 7, but not next to each other. The shoe store is in space 2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the pharmacy is in space 1, it can't be next to the shoe store in space 2. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. This means a restaurant must be in space 1. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the other restaurant can't be in space 3. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 6, the toy store can't be in space 7 (where the pharmacy is). Therefore, the toy store can't be in space 6. The optometrist can't be in space 5 because the pharmacy is in space 7 and must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The veterinarian can be in space 4 because it's not next to the toy store and it's not next to the pharmacy.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
