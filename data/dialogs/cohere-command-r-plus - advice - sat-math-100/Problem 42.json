I should be more careful with my algebraic manipulations and double-check my work.\n\nThought: \nExpanding the left side, we get $abx^2 + (a*7 + b*2)x + 14$. Comparing coefficients, we get:\n- $ab = 15$\n- $a*7 + b*2 = c$\n- Solving for $a$ and $b$ in the first equation, we get $a = \\frac{15}{b}$\n- Substituting $a$ into the second equation, we get $c = 7(\\frac{15}{b}) + 2b$\n- Setting $c = 3$, we get $7(\\frac{15}{b}) + 2b = 3 \\rightarrow 105 + 2b^2 = 3b \\rightarrow b^2 - 15b + 42 = 0$\n- Solving for $b$, we get $b = 6$ or $b = 7$\n- Plugging $b$ back into the equation $a + b = 8$, we get $a = 2$ or $a = 1$\n- Finally, plugging the values of $a$ and $b$ into $c = 7(\\frac{15}{b}) + 2b$, we get $c = 3$ or $c = 5$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
