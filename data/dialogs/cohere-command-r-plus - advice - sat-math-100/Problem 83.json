A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?\nChoices:\n  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store\n  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected\n  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees\n  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Understand the goal of statistical sampling: to make inferences about a population from a representative subset. \n - Always consider the potential for bias in your sampling method. \n - Recognize that in this case, representation is key: each store should contribute to the sample to ensure an unbiased estimate. \n - Avoid methods that introduce bias, such as self-selection or non-random sampling. \n - Remember that the goal is to estimate the proportion across all stores, not to understand satisfaction within a single store or among specific employee groups.\n"
