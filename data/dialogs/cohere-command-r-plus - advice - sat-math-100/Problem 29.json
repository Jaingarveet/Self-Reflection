I should have double-checked my calculations and ensured that I was correctly applying the formula. In my reflection, I realized that I needed to treat Earth as one of the options and calculate the mass of the object using its gravity before proceeding to calculate the weights on the other planets. This systematic approach ensures accuracy and allows for a proper comparison.\n\nThought: Using the formula $W=mg$, where $W$ is weight and $m$ is mass, I can calculate the mass of the object on Earth:\n\\[150=m\\cdot9.8\\].\n\nSolving for $m$, I find that $m=15.3 \\text{ kg}$. Now, I can calculate the weight of this object on each planet:\n- Venus: $W=15.3 \\times 8.9 \\approx 136.17 \\text{ N}$\n- Saturn: $W=15.3 \\times 11.1 \\approx 168.33 \\text{ N}$\n- Uranus: $W=15.3 \\times 10.7 \\approx 163.71 \\text{ N}$\n- Neptune: $W=15.3 \\times 14.1 \\approx 214.77 \\text{ N}$\n\nOnly Neptune results in a weight of approximately 170 newtons.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
