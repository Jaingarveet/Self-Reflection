I canceled out $a$ in the numerator and denominator of the given expression without considering that it might be needed later. This led to an incorrect simplification and, ultimately, the wrong answer. To find the right solution, I should remember that $a \\neq 0$ because it is a denominator in the given expression.\n\nThought: \nGiven $\\frac{a}{b}=2$, we can solve for $a$ to find $a=2b$.\nNow, we can plug this value into the expression $\\frac{4b}{a}$ to get $\\frac{4b}{2b}$.\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{4}{2}$, which equals $2$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
