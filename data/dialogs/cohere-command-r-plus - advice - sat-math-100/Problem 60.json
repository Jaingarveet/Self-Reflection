I incorrectly assumed that the additional 21 milliliters of solution would result in a total of 26 milliliters for each student, which led me to calculate an incorrect number of students. \n\nSolving simultaneously yields the correct answer:\nLet $x$ be the number of students. \n\nThe first scenario: $3x + 5 = n \\implies 3x = n - 5$.\n\nThe second scenario: $4x = n \\implies 4x + 21 = n + 21$.\n\nNow, we can substitute: $4x + 21 = (3x + 5) + 21 = 3x + 26$.\n\nThis gives: $x = \\frac{26}{3} = 8\\frac{2}{3}$, so there are $\\boxed{26}$ milliliters required for each student in the class.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
