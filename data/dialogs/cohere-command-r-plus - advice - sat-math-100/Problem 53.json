I correctly identified the formula as $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. However, when testing the choices, I incorrectly calculated $7 - 0 = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot (1 - 0)$. The correct calculation is, in fact, $7 = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 7$, which is true, so choice A is the correct answer. I need to be more careful with my calculations and ensure I'm using the formula correctly.\n\nThought: \nThe line passes through the origin, so we can use $(0,0)$ as the point $(x_1, y_1)$ in the point-slope formula:\n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\nThis gives:\n$y - 0 = \\frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$.\nSimplifying, we get:\n$y = \\frac{1}{7}x$.\nNow, we can test each choice:\n- Choice A: $(0,7)$: $7 = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 7$, this is true, so $(0,7)$ lies on the line.\n- Choice B: $(1,7)$: $6 \\neq \\frac{1}{7}$, so $(1,7)$ does not lie on the line.\n- Choice C: $(7,7)$: $0 \\neq \\frac{1}{7}$, so $(7,7)$ does not lie on the line.\n- Choice D: $(14,2)$: $2 \\neq \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 14$, so $(14,2)$ does not lie on the line.\n\nTherefore, choice A is the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
