To find the equation, we can use the pattern $x+y=constant$.\n\nPlugging in any of the given values, we can verify:\nFor $x=a, y=0$: $a + 0 = a$\nFor $x=3a, y=-a$: $3a + (-a) = 2a$\nFor $x=5a, y=-2a$: $5a + (-2a) = 3a$.\n\nSo, the equation that represents the relationship is $x + y = a$.\n\nThis equation is equivalent to choice A: $x + 2y = a$, where the coefficient of $y$ is incorrect and should be 1, not 2.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
