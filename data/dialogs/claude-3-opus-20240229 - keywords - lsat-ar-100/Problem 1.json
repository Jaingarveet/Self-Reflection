At least one witness testifies on Monday\nLooking at each choice:\nA. This could be true. If Franco testifies Monday, then Garcia would have to testify Tuesday or Wednesday, satisfying condition 1. The other conditions could still be met.\nB. This cannot be true. Iturbe testifies Wednesday (condition 2), so if Franco also testifies Wednesday it would violate condition 1 since Garcia would have to testify Wednesday too. \nC. This could be true and satisfies condition 3. Franco could testify Monday, and Jackson Wednesday.\nD. This could be true. It satisfies conditions 1, 3 and 4. Jackson and Iturbe would testify Wednesday to meet condition 2.\nE. This could be true. Two witnesses (e.g. Franco and Garcia) testify Monday, satisfying conditions 1, 4 and 5. Jackson on Tuesday satisfies condition 3. \nTherefore, the only choice that CANNOT be true is B, because it would require Franco, Garcia and Iturbe to all testify on Wednesday, violating the condition that Franco and Garcia testify on different days.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
