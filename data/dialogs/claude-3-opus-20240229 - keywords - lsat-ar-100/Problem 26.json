        "content": "Okay, let me think through this step-by-step:\n1. The third solo must be a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.\n2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively. Given the third solo is traditional, the second or fourth solo must also be traditional to satisfy this condition. \n3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means if the fourth solo is traditional, it must be performed by Wayne.\n4. No traditional piece can be performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. So Wayne must perform a modern piece in either the first or second solo.\n5. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth. This eliminates some possibilities but doesn't directly impact the minimum number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.\n6. Considering the above, the minimum number of traditional pieces Wayne must perform is one:\n   - 1st solo: Wayne modern \n   - 2nd solo: Zara modern\n   - 3rd solo: Zara traditional \n   - 4th solo: Wayne traditional\n   - 5th solo: Wayne modern\nIn this scenario, Wayne performs the minimum one traditional piece in the 4th solo to satisfy the consecutive traditional pieces condition and the 4th solo condition.\nWhile there are other valid orderings, there is no scenario where Wayne performs zero traditional pieces while satisfying all the given conditions.\nTherefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is one.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
