Let's consider each answer choice:\nA) Megregian does not review Undulation. \nThis could be true. Megregian reviews the most plays, but that doesn't necessarily include Undulation.\nB) O'Neill does not review Undulation.\nWe know O'Neill reviews Tamerlane. But he could also review Undulation, so this isn't necessarily true.\nC) Jiang reviews Undulation.\nThis can't be true. If Jiang reviewed Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian could review it. But we need 3 students to review Undulation.\nD) Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\nLopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, but one of those could be Tamerlane. This could be true.\nE) O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nWe know O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, but he could also review Sunset. This could be true.\nAfter careful consideration, the only choice that cannot be true is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
