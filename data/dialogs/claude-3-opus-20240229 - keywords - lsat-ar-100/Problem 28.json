We're told that F (a botanist), L (a chemist), Q and R (both zoologists) are already selected. So the botanist and chemist requirements are met.\n3. If more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected. But we already have two zoologists (Q and R), so we can't select another botanist. This eliminates G and H.\n4. K and M can't both be selected. We already have L as a chemist, so if we select another it must be either K or M, but not both. \n5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. We already have R, but not P. So if we select M, we must also select P.\n6. Our only options left are K, M and P. But if we select M, we must also select P, giving us 6 panelists total which is not allowed. \nTherefore, the only possible 5th scientist is K.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
