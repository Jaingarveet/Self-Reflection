Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.\n3. There are more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n4. The question states that more sales reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. \n5. Let's consider the choices:\n   A) Kim works in Zone 2 - This could be true, as we don't have any information about where Kim works.\n   \n   B) Mahr works in Zone 2 - Similar to A, this could be true.\n   \n   C) Parra works in Zone 3 - This can't be true. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn also works in Zone 3. But we're told that more reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3.\n   \n   D) Tiao works in Zone 1 - This could be true. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 (with Quinn), and Udall works in Zone 2 (with Stuckey). This satisfies all the conditions.\n   \n   E) Udall works in Zone 3 - This can't be true. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey also works in Zone 3. But we're told that more reps work in Zone 1 than Zone 3.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
