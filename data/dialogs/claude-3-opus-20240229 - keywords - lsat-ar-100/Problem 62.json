The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.\n  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Constraint application error\n - Deductive reasoning error\n - Incomplete analysis\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We're told that if Kayne is assigned an ambassadorship, then Jaramillo must also be assigned one. \n2. The question states that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Jaramillo must also be assigned an ambassadorship.\n3. This eliminates choice D, which states Jaramillo is not assigned an ambassadorship.\n4. We're also told that if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned to Yemen. But the question states Kayne is assigned to Yemen. Therefore, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.\n5. The only remaining countries are Venezuela and Zambia. Since Jaramillo must be assigned, and cannot be assigned to the same country as Kayne (Yemen), Jaramillo must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia.\n6. If Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, then Ong must be assigned to Zambia. But we're told that if Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia. This would create a conflict.\n7. Therefore, the only possibility is that Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, and Landon is assigned to Zambia.\nSo the correct answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
