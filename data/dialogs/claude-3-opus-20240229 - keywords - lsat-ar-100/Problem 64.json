Let me think through this more carefully.\nGiven:\n- There are 7 sales reps: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n- They work in 3 zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3\n- Either Parra or Tiao (not both) works in Zone 1\n- Either Tiao or Udall (not both) works in Zone 2  \n- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone\n- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone\n- More reps work in Zone 3 than Zone 2\nIf Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone, let's consider the possibilities:\n1. Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1\n   - This means Udall is also in Zone 1 (with Stuckey)\n   - Parra can't be in Zone 1, so must be in Zone 3 with Quinn\n   - Tiao must be in Zone 2\n   - Kim could be in either Zone 2 or 3\n2. Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 2\n   - Udall is also in Zone 2 (with Stuckey)\n   - Tiao can't be in Zone 2, so must be in Zone 1\n   - Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3\n   - This violates the constraint of more reps in Zone 3 than 2\n3. Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3\n   - Udall is also in Zone 3 (with Stuckey) \n   - Parra and Quinn could be in Zone 1 or 3\n   - Tiao could be in Zone 1 or 2\n   - Kim could be in Zone 2 or 3\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. Kim works in Zone 2 - Possible if Mahr/Stuckey are in Zone 1 or 3\nB. Mahr works in Zone 1 - Possible \nC. Parra works in Zone 3 - Possible if Mahr/Stuckey are in Zone 1 or 3\nD. Stuckey works in Zone 2 - Not possible as it violates a constraint\nE. Tiao works in Zone 1 - Possible if Mahr/Stuckey are in Zone 2 or 3\nTherefore, the correct answer is that any of A, B, C or E could be true.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
