Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect constraint interpretation\n - Invalid assumption\n - Faulty logical reasoning\n"

Nessa must lead an afternoon session.\n4. Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's.\n5. The question states that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session.\nGiven constraint 2, if Lan does not lead on Wednesday, then Olivia must lead on Wednesday. \nThen by constraint 4, Julio must lead a session on Wednesday morning, since his session has to be earlier than Olivia's.\nBy constraint 1, Kevin and Rebecca lead on the same day, which cannot be Wednesday. It also cannot be Friday, because then there would be no valid day left for Lan.\nTherefore, Kevin and Rebecca must both lead sessions on Thursday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
