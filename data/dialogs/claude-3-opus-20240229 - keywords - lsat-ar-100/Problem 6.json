        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, making sure to consider all the relevant information:\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian reviews the most plays.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means Jiang's plays are different from Lopez's and Megregian's. \n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So they have at least one play in common.\n4. Exactly two students review exactly the same play(s). Given #3, this must be Kramer and O'Neill. No other pair can match.\n5. Since Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian (#1), and Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays (#4), O'Neill must also review fewer plays than Megregian.\nTherefore, the answer that must be true is C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
