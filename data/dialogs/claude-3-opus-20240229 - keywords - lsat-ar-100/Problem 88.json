At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

Let me think through this again more carefully.\nGiven:\n- 8 books total: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O\n- 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom \n- At least 2 books per shelf\n- More books on bottom than top\n- I is on the middle shelf\n- K is on a higher shelf than F\n- O is on a higher shelf than L\n- F and M are on the same shelf\nIf we add the new information from each answer choice:\nA) If I and M are on the middle shelf together, then F must also be on the middle shelf. But this doesn't fully determine the shelves, as the other books could still be arranged in multiple ways.\nB) If K and G are on the same shelf, this could be either the top or middle shelf. It doesn't fully determine the shelves.\nC) If L and F are on the same shelf, they must be on the bottom, since F is below K and L is below O. M would also have to be on the bottom. I is on the middle. This leaves H, G, K, O for the other spots. K and O must be on the top since they are above F and L respectively. This fully determines it! \nBottom: F, L, M\nMiddle: I  \nTop: G, H, K, O\nD) If M and H are together, they could be on the middle or bottom shelf. This doesn't fully determine the shelves.\nE) If H and O are together, they could be on the middle or top shelf. This doesn't fully determine the shelves.\nTherefore, C is the only choice that, if true, would fully determine the arrangement on the shelves.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
