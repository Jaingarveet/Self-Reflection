        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is Tuesday. \n2. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n3. No two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. So on Thursday, only the second batch of sugar cookies can be made.\n4. At least one batch is made on Monday. It can't be peanut butter (first batch Tuesday) or sugar (second batch Thursday). So the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.\n5. Putting this together:\n   Monday: 1st oatmeal \n   Tuesday: 2nd oatmeal, 1st peanut butter\n   Thursday: 2nd sugar\n   \n6. The 3rd oatmeal, 2nd peanut butter, 1st sugar, and 3rd sugar batches still need to be scheduled on the remaining days (Wednesday, Friday). \n7. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A: Could be true. 1st oatmeal is made Monday, 1st sugar or peanut butter could be too.\n   B: Cannot be true. We know 1st peanut butter is Tuesday, and 1st oatmeal is Monday.\n   C: Could be true. 2nd peanut butter and another 2nd batch could be made Wednesday. \n   D: Cannot be true. Only 2nd sugar is made Thursday.\n   E: Could be true. Any two 3rd batches could be made Friday.\nTherefore, the statement that CANNOT be true is B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
