At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.\n3. O is performed either first or fifth.\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.\n5. P is performed at some time before S.\n6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nWe're also told that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth. Let's use this information:\n7. Since T is performed fifth and F sixth, we know from condition 1 that R must be performed fourth. \n8. Condition 2 is satisfied, as there are two compositions (T and F) after R.\n9. From condition 3, we know O must be performed first, as T is already occupying the fifth position.\n10. Condition 4 is not yet determined.\n11. From condition 5, we know P must be performed before S. And from condition 6, we know S must be performed after O (first position).\n12. The remaining positions to fill are second, third, seventh and eighth. And the remaining compositions are H, L, P and S.\n13. P must come before S. So P could be second or third, and S could be third, seventh or eighth.\n14. But the eighth composition must be either L or H (condition 4). So S cannot be eighth. \nTherefore, S must be performed either third or seventh.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
