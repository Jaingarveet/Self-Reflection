The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. \n3. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.\n4. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nFrom constraints 1 and 2, we know the order is: textiles < livestock < grain\nFrom constraint 3, we know: fuel < produce\nFrom constraint 4, textiles and produce must be in adjacent bays.\nThe only way to satisfy constraint 4 is:\n- textiles in bay 3 and produce in bay 4, OR\n- produce in bay 3 and textiles in bay 4\nIf produce is in bay 4, then fuel must be in bays 1, 2 or 3 (constraint 3).\nLivestock must be in bays 1, 2, 3 or 5 (constraint 2). \nGrain must be in bays 2, 3, 5 or 6 (constraint 1).\nSo if produce is in bay 4, the other options for bay 4 are fuel, livestock or grain.
