Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Failure to consider all possibilities\n - Incorrect constraint application\n - Hasty conclusion\n"

The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end. \n3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian.\n4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. \n5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nIf the pharmacy is in space 1, then:\n- The optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2. But space 2 is the shoe store, so this is not possible.\nTherefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. A restaurant must be in space 1.\nNow let's check each answer choice:\nA. The optometrist is in space 5. \n   This is possible. The veterinarian could be in space 6, satisfying the pharmacy constraint.\nB. The pharmacy is in space 1. \n   We already determined this is not possible.\nC. A restaurant is in space 3.\n   This violates the constraint that restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.\nD. The toy store is in space 6.\n   This is possible and does not violate the constraint about the toy store and veterinarian.\nE. The veterinarian is in space 4.\n   This would put the optometrist in space 6 (to be next to the pharmacy). But then the toy store would have to be next to the veterinarian, which is not allowed.\nAfter analyzing all possibilities, both A and D could be true.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
