Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.\n  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Misinterpretation of conditions\n"

The key conditions are:\n   - Reynaldo cannot test F\n   - Yuki cannot test J \n   - Theresa must test H on one of the days\n   - The bicycle Yuki tests on day 1 must be tested by Seamus on day 2\n2. We're told Theresa tests G on day 2. From the conditions, we know she must test H on day 1.\n3. Since Yuki's day 1 bicycle is tested by Seamus on day 2, and we know Theresa has G on day 2, Yuki must have tested G on day 1. \n4. Reynaldo can't test F, and Yuki can't test J. So on day 1, Reynaldo must have tested J.\n5. To summarize:\n   Day 1: Reynaldo-J, Seamus-F, Theresa-H, Yuki-G\n   Day 2: Theresa-G\n   \nTherefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
