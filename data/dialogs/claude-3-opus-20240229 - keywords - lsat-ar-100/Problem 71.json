Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete reasoning\n - Failure to consider all possibilities\n - Over-constraining the problem\n - Flawed process of elimination\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1. So if Parra is in Zone 1, Tiao must be in Zone 2 (since Tiao can't be in both Zone 1 and Zone 2). And if Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra must be in Zone 3 (since Parra and Quinn are in the same zone).\n2. Similarly, Tiao and Udall can't both be in Zone 2. So if Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall must be in Zone 3 (since Udall and Stuckey are in the same zone). And if Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao must be in Zone 1.\n3. There are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. So Zone 3 must have at least 3 people.\n4. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A) Kim and Mahr in Zone 3 - possible but doesn't account for everyone\n   B) Kim and Tiao in Zone 3 - not possible since if Tiao is in Zone 3, Parra and Quinn must also be\n   C) Parra and Quinn in Zone 3 - possible but doesn't account for Stuckey and Udall who must be together\n   D) Stuckey, Tiao, Udall in Zone 3 - not possible since Tiao and Udall can't be in the same zone\n   E) Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall in Zone 3 - this works and accounts for the most people in Zone 3\nTherefore, the only possible complete list of Zone 3 reps is E) Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
