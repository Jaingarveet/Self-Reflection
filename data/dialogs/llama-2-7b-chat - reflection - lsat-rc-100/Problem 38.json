        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the passage's position concerning the apparently healthful effects of moderate wine consumption?\nChoices:\n  A: Subjects who consumed large amount of grape juice exhibited decreased thickness of the innermost walls of their blood vessels.\n  B: Subjects who were habitual drinkers of wine and subjects who were habitual drinkers of beer exhibited similar lipid levels in their bloodstreams.\n  C: Subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice.\n  D: Subjects who drank excessive amounts of wine suffered from premature heart disease at roughly the same rate as moderate wine drinkers.\n  E: Subjects who possess a natural clot-breaking compound were discovered to have a certain gene that is absent from subjects who do not possess the compound.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe passage suggests that the apparently healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic beverages. The passage cites a study that demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice, which may be the first step in confirming this speculation. Therefore, if a study were to show that subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice, this would most strengthen the passage's position concerning the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine consumption.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "  Great, let's break down the answer:\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice.\n\nThe passage suggests that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the natural compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic beverages. The study mentioned in the passage found that individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice had decreased platelet adhesiveness, which may be the first step in confirming the speculation that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes.\n\nTherefore, if a study were to show that subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice, this would provide further evidence to support the passage's position that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the natural compounds found in grapes.\n\nThe other options do not provide strong evidence to support the passage's position:\n\nOption (A) is not relevant to the passage's argument, as it does not provide any information about the relationship between grape juice consumption and platelet adhesiveness.\n\nOption (B) is also not relevant, as the passage does not compare the lipid levels in the bloodstreams of wine drinkers and beer drinkers.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect, as the passage does not suggest that excessive wine consumption leads to premature heart disease at the same rate as moderate wine consumption.\n\nOption (E) is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about a gene that is associated with the clot-breaking compound."
