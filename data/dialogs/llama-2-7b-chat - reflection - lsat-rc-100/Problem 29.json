        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went \"against all previous experiences of nuclear physics,\" but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term \"nuclear fission,\" she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.\nQuestion: According to the passage, which one of the following was true of the physics community during the 1930s?\nChoices:\n  A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.\n  B: It reevaluated caleulations indicating that atoms could be split\n  C: It never identified the by-products ofneutron bombardment ofuraniwn.\n  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.\n  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nAccording to the passage, during the 1930s, the physics community reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split. This is stated in the passage as follows: \"But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.\" This suggests that while some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving this result, and the physics community as a whole was not receptive to the possibility. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

According to the passage, the physics community during the 1930s reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split, but did not recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.\n\nHere's a summary of the passage's main points:\n\n* In the 1930s, a group of Italian physicists bombarded uranium with neutrons, leading to the discovery of nuclear fission.\n* Exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, but her findings were not immediately recognized by the physics community.\n* The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen.\n* Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split, but these calculations were not taken seriously.\n* Meitner and her research partner Otto Hahn identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, including barium, which was conclusively identified as an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism involved in the experiments.\n* Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and coined the term \"nuclear fission.\"\n\nI hope this helps!
