        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted \"as it is\" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible \"reality\" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: \"The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.\" The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art \"a shameful destiny.\" A literary work must stand or fall on its \"artistic merit,\" he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is \"artistic\" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: \"To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well.\" The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be \"useful\" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.\n  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.\n  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.\n  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.\n  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe passage presents three positions on the role of art in society, with the third position being differentiated from the first two in detail. The passage explains Dostoyevsky's position as a realist who believes that reality is the crucial source of literature, but also recognizes that reality is shaped by the person experiencing it. The passage then contrasts Dostoyevsky's position with that of radical critics who demand that art serve a particular political view. The passage does not present a hierarchy of the three positions, but rather presents each position in detail. Therefore, option B is the best answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "  Great, let's break down the passage and analyze the answer to the question:\n\nThe passage presents three positions on the role of art in society:\n\n1. The first position is that art stands high above the present and the everyday.\n2. The second position is that art has a right to exist only if it finds its sources in concrete reality and contributes to the creation of a new society.\n3. The third position is Dostoyevsky's realist position, which recognizes that reality is shaped by the person experiencing it, and that art must explore the boundaries of the so-called real world.\n\nThe passage differentiates the third position from the first two by providing more detail on Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and his rejection of the radical critics' demand that art serve a particular political view.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option B: \"Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.\"\n\nThe passage does not present a hierarchy of the three positions, but rather presents each position in detail, highlighting their differences and similarities. Option A is not accurate, as the passage does not present three positions in detail, but rather presents one position (Dostoyevsky's) in detail, while briefly mentioning the other two positions. Option C is also not accurate, as the passage does not present the third position as inferior to the second. Option D is not accurate, as the passage does not present the third position as superior to the first two. Option E is not accurate, as the passage does not present a comparison between the three positions."
