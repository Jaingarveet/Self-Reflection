        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term \"proverb\" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, \"Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are.\" Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly implied by the passage?\nChoices:\n  A: If a proverb is used to inculcate table manners, then its primary purpose is to maintain ties to an ethnic tradition.\n  B: The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.\n  C: The ways in which Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs are typical of the ways in which Spanish speakers throughout the world use those proverbs.\n  D: There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.\n  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe passage suggests that the frequent use of proverbs within Mexican American communities serves to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, particularly among children. The passage states that proverbs often serve to transmit the Spanish language and Mexican culture, and that they provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition. Therefore, option (B) is the most strongly implied by the passage.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

I'll be happy to help you with this.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) The frequent use of proverbs within any community functions, at least in part, to convey a sense of their ethnicity to children within that community.\n\nThe passage suggests that proverbs are used in Mexican American communities to teach children about their heritage and to foster a consciousness of their ethnicity. The passage states that proverbs are a means of transmitting the Spanish language and Mexican culture, and that they provide a way for children to learn about their heritage and strengthen their ties to Mexican tradition. This implies that the use of proverbs in any community serves, at least in part, to convey a sense of ethnicity to children within that community.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the passage:\n\nOption (A) is not implied by the passage, as it does not mention anything about table manners.\n\nOption (C) is not accurate, as the passage does mention that Mexican Americans use Spanish-language proverbs, but it does not suggest that their use of proverbs is typical of Spanish speakers throughout the world.\n\nOption (D) is partially correct, as the passage does mention that the meaning of a proverb depends on the social context in which it is used. However, the passage does not suggest that the meaning of a proverb is dependent on the verbal context alone.\n\nOption (E) is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about the emphasis on teaching children about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities being distinct from other communities in the United States."
