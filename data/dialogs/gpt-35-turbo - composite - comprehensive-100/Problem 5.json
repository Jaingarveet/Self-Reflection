If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly set up the equation to solve for the number of members in the club, but I made an error in simplifying the equation. \nThe gap in my knowledge was in simplifying quadratic equations. \nI made a mistake in expanding the brackets and simplifying the quadratic equation. \nError Keywords:\n - Quadratic equation error\n - Algebraic simplification error\n - Arithmetic error\nSolution:\nThe sum of the ages of n members in an [REDACTED].P. with first term a and common difference d is given by the formula: S = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]\nHere, a = 7 years and d = 1/4 years.\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is [REDACTED]0, so we have:\n[REDACTED]0 = n/2[2(7) + (n-1)(1/4)]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n500 = n[14 + (n-1)/4]\nMultiplying both sides by 4, we get:\n[REDACTED]00 = 4n[14 + (n-1)/4]\nExpanding the brackets, we get:\n[REDACTED]00 = 56n + n^2 - n/4\nSimplifying this quadratic equation, we get:\nn^2 + 55n - 8000 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula, we get:\nn = (-55 ± sqrt(55^2 + 4(8000)))/2\nn = (-55 ± 2[REDACTED])/2\nn = 85/2 or n = -140\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 85/2, which is not one of the given choices.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given information and what needs to be solved.\n3. Use the appropriate formula to set up an equation to solve for the unknown.\n4. Simplify the equation step-by-step, being careful with algebraic manipulations.\n5. Solve the equation using the appropriate method, such as factoring or the quadratic formula.\n6. Check your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the given information and what needs to be solved.\n - Always use the appropriate formula to set up an equation to solve for the unknown.\n - Always simplify the equation step-by-step, being careful with algebraic manipulations.\n - Always solve the equation using the appropriate method, such as factoring or the quadratic formula.\n - Always check your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\n - Remember that the answer may not always be one of the given choices.\n"
