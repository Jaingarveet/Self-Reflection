How long after they begin will they meet?\nChoices:\n  A:  1\n  B:  1.25\n  C:  1.50\n  D:  1.75\n  E:  2\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI used the correct formula but made a calculation error. \nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the formula but in basic arithmetic. \nI correctly identified that the combined speed of the two cars is[REDACTED]5 mph (12 mph +[REDACTED]3 mph), but I made a mistake in calculating the time it would take for them to meet.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Arithmetic error\n - Addition error\n - Unit error\nSolution:\nLet's call the time it takes for the two cars to meet \"t\".\nThe distance each car travels is equal to the product of its speed and the time it travels.\nFor the car traveling at[REDACTED]2 mph, the distance it travels is[REDACTED]2t.\nFor the car traveling at[REDACTED]3 mph, the distance it travels is[REDACTED]3t.\nThe sum of the distances traveled by both cars is equal to the total distance between them, which is 50 miles.\nSo we can write the equation:\n12t +[REDACTED]3t = 50\n25t = 50\nt =[REDACTED]\nTherefore, the two cars will meet[REDACTED] hours after they begin.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the speeds of the two cars.\n2. Identify the distance between the two cars.\n3. Use the formula distance = speed x time to find the time it takes for each car to travel.\n4. Write an equation that relates the distances traveled by both cars.\n5. Solve the equation for the time it takes for the two cars to meet.\n6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to use the correct units in your calculations.\n"
