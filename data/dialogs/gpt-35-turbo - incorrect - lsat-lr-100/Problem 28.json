To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that shows that the situation is not as bad as it seems.\nOption A talks about the overall crime rate, which is not relevant to the argument. Option B is irrelevant as it talks about age groups. Option C strengthens the argument by stating that more people are willing to report violent crimes. Option D is irrelevant as it talks about a community center. Option E weakens the argument by stating that a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town, which means that the average citizen is not as likely to become a victim of a violent crime as the argument suggests.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
