However, upon further reflection, I realized that [REDACTED] can also be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Overgeneralization error\n- Lack of consideration of alternative explanations\n\nSolution:\nAnimal instinct refers to the innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught. Migrating, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are all examples of animal instinct. However, [REDACTED] can be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones. For example, a mother lion may teach her cubs how to hunt. Therefore, [REDACTED] are not always an example of animal instinct.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n2. Consider each option and evaluate whether it is an example of animal instinct.\n3. Remember that animal instinct refers to innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught.\n4. Consider whether the behavior could be learned or taught, rather than instinctual.\n5. Choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.\n- Avoid making assumptions about the options.\n- Consider alternative explanations for each option.\n- Remember that animal instinct refers to innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught.\n- Consider whether the behavior could be learned or taught, rather than instinctual.\n- Choose the option that is least likely to be an example of animal instinct.\n"
