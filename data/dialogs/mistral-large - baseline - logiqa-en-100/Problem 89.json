(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\n"

So if Dr. Li treats J (male child), he must also treat E or F (male adults). If Dr. Li treats K (female child), he must also treat G, H, or I (female adults).\n* Since Dr. Li can only treat one patient, he cannot treat both J and K. Therefore, at least one of J and K must be treated by a different doctor.\n* If J is treated by Dr. Zhang, then Dr. Li cannot treat J, so he must treat K. But then Dr. Li would have to treat a female adult, and he can only treat one patient. Therefore, J cannot be treated by Dr. Zhang.\n* If J is treated by Dr. Wang or Dr. Liu, then they must also treat a male adult (E or F). But then Dr. Zhang would have to treat the remaining male patient, which would mean he is treating two patients, violating condition (1). Therefore, J must be treated by Dr. Li.\n* Since J is treated by Dr. Li, he cannot treat any other patient. Therefore, Dr. Zhang must treat the remaining male patients (E and F), and Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu must treat the remaining female patients (G, H, I, and K).\n* Since Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu can each treat up to two patients, they can divide the female patients between them in any way that satisfies condition (3).\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") (J is treated by Dr. Li)"
