The argument also assumes that being Taiwanese and being Chinese are mutually exclusive, which is not necessarily true.\n\nTo show that the argument is not valid, we need to find an example of invalid reasoning that has a similar structure.\n\nChoice A is not relevant because it does not have a similar structure to the argument in the context.\n\nChoice B is not relevant because it does not have a similar structure to the argument in the context.\n\nChoice C is not relevant because it is a valid argument.\n\nChoice D is not relevant because it does not have a similar structure to the argument in the context.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nChoice A is the best answer because it has a similar structure to the argument in the context. The argument in choice A is not valid because it assumes that eating in clothes is the only criteria for being successful, which is not necessarily true. Similarly, the argument in the context assumes that being under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is the only criteria for being Chinese, which is also not necessarily true."
