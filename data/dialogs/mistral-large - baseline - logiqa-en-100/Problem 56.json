It suggests that most international ships are moored at ports below the bridge, and there is little need for larger ships to pass through. Choice C raises doubts about the effectiveness of demolishing only the Nanjing Bridge, but it does not necessarily argue against the need to allow larger ships to pass through. Choice D shows that shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where larger ships can pass through the bridge, but it does not necessarily argue against the need to allow even larger ships to pass through. Therefore, any of the three choices could be used to raise doubts about the expert's point of view, but choice B is the most convincing argument against demolishing the bridge."
