This suggests that the increase in transaction volume may not be due to more buyers, but rather to existing buyers purchasing more or more expensive properties.\nChoice C is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses real estate speculation within China, not abroad.\nChoice D discusses the low risk of the US real estate market, which could be a reason for Chinese buyers to invest in US real estate, but it does not necessarily contradict the argument that more Chinese buyers are investing abroad.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
