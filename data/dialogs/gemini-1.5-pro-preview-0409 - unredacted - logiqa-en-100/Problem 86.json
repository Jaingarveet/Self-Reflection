I assumed \"adjacent\" meant directly next to each other, leading to an incorrect sequence.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation\n*   Logical reasoning error\n*   Ordering error\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze Clues:** We know:\n    *   West to East order.\n    *   Fuyi is between Haoyun (West) and Huyao (East) and next to Huyao.\n    *   Jiushang is East of and next to Haoyun.\n    *   Jiushang is also next to Yinling.\n2.  **Establish Order:**\n    *   Haoyun is the westernmost as Fuyi is East of it.\n    *   Jiushang is next to Haoyun (East).\n    *   Yinling is next to Jiushang (unknown direction yet).\n    *   Fuyi is next to Huyao, and we know Huyao is East of Fuyi, so Huyao is the easternmost.\n3.  **Deduce Conclusion:** Since Huyao is the easternmost, the answer is **A: Huyao is standing on the east side.**\n**Instructions for Future Problems:**\n1.  **Carefully analyze each statement** and its implications.\n2.  **Draw a diagram or map** to visualize the relationships.\n3.  **Consider all possibilities** before establishing order.\n4.  **Pay attention to keywords** like \"adjacent\" and their exact meaning.\n5.  **Double-check the logic** and ensure conclusions are supported by the given information.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Avoid assumptions** and stick to the given information.\n*   **Break down complex statements** into smaller parts.\n*   **Look for relationships and connections** between elements.\n*   **Use visualization tools** to aid understanding.\n*   **Practice logical reasoning** with various problems.\n"
