(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My error was assuming that I and E must come after H, limiting the possible arrangements. I failed to consider the possibility of I and E being located between G and F.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Logic error\n*   Assumption error\n*   Ordering error\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **G is northernmost:** The order starts with G.\n2.  **F is south of G:** From (3), F must come after G. Order is now GF.\n3.  **H is south of F:** From (1), H must come after F. Order is now GFH.\n4.  **I and E are adjacent:** From (2), I and E are together. They can be placed in three positions:\n    *   **South of H:** GFHI, GFHIE (two possibilities as I and E can switch)\n    *   **Between G and F:** GIFH, GIEFH (two possibilities as I and E can switch)\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Analyze each statement individually:** Break down the given information into separate facts.\n2.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions about the order or placement of elements unless explicitly stated.\n3.  **Systematically explore placements:** Try placing the remaining elements in all possible valid positions.\n4.  **Count distinct arrangements:** Ensure each arrangement is unique and adheres to all given conditions.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n*   **Visualize the problem:** Draw diagrams or use objects to represent the elements and their relationships.\n*   **Work systematically:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and explore all possibilities in an organized manner.\n*   **Check for consistency:** Ensure your solution satisfies all the given conditions and constraints.\n*   **Practice similar problems:** The more you practice, the better you become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying logical reasoning.\n"
