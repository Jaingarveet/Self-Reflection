(1) Li was hired by Tianshu; (2) Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit; (3) Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit; (4) If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang Ye Was hired by Tianxuan.\nQuestion: Which of the following may be correct?\nChoices:\n  A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit.\n  B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.\n  C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan.\n  D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused too much on eliminating options based on Zhao and Liu's placement, neglecting the possibility of other valid arrangements. I also misinterpreted statement (4) as providing less information than it actually did.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of conditional statement\n*   Overlooking possibilities\n*   Focusing on irrelevant information\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze Statements:**\n    *   (1) Li is in Tianshu.\n    *   (2) Zhao is not in Tianshu (due to 1).\n    *   (3) Liu and Zhao are in the same unit (not Tianshu due to 2).\n    *   (4) If Zhang is in Tianxuan, then Wang is also in Tianxuan (contrapositive: if Wang is NOT in Tianxuan, then Zhang is NOT in Tianxuan).\n2.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   A: Li and Liu cannot be together (Li is in Tianshu, Liu is not).\n    *   B: This option is uncertain based on the given information.\n    *   **C: This option contradicts statement (3) as Liu and Zhao must be together.** \n    *   D: This option is possible if Wang is in Tianxuan (forcing Zhang out due to 4) and Zhao & Liu are in Tianji.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is the only one that doesn't contradict any of the given statements and is therefore a possible correct answer. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Carefully analyze each statement, identifying the information it provides and any constraints it imposes.**\n2.  **Pay close attention to conditional statements and consider their contrapositives.**\n3.  **Consider all possibilities that do not contradict the given information.**\n4.  **Eliminate options that directly contradict any of the statements.**\n5.  **Choose the option that remains possible based on the analysis.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Break down complex logical problems into smaller, manageable pieces.**\n*   **Focus on the relationships between individuals or elements based on the given statements.**\n*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid making assumptions not supported by the information provided.**\n*   **Practice with various logic problems to improve your reasoning and analytical skills.**\n"
