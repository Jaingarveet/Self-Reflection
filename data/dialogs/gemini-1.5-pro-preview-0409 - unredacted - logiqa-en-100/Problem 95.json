I failed to grasp the underlying message about collective effort and unity.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation \n*   Focus on literal meaning\n*   Ignoring figurative language \n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Analyze the context:** Premier Wen uses multiplication and division as metaphors.\n2.  **Interpret the metaphors:** \n    *   Multiplication: Small problems become big when applied to a large population.\n    *   Division: Large totals become small when distributed among a large population.\n3.  **Identify the underlying message:** Collective effort (everyone contributing) can overcome large challenges or achieve significant goals.\n4.  **Connect to answer choices:** Option D, \"Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high,\" best reflects the idea of collective effort leading to success.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  **Read the entire passage carefully:** Pay attention to the context and any figurative language used.\n2.  **Identify the main point:** Look beyond the literal meaning and consider the underlying message.\n3.  **Analyze answer choices in relation to the main point:** Choose the option that best reflects the core message of the passage.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Be aware of figurative language:** Metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech can convey deeper meanings.\n*   **Consider multiple interpretations:** Don't jump to conclusions based on the literal meaning alone.\n*   **Think about the author's intent:** What message are they trying to convey? \n*   **Develop cultural awareness:** Understanding cultural references and context is crucial for accurate interpretation.\n"
