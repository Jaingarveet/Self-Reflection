        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.\nQuestion: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?\nChoices:\n  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.\n  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.\n  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nI focused on finding an option that directly contradicted the expert's claim about the bridge hindering large ships. While option B did offer a counter-argument, it didn't directly address the feasibility of rebuilding the bridge. I failed to consider the possibility of technological solutions that could negate the need for demolition.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Misinterpretation of question intent\n*   Focus on contradiction rather than feasibility\n*   Neglecting technological solutions\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the expert's claim:** The expert asserts that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge needs demolition and rebuilding to allow passage of giant ships, implying current limitations.\n2.  **Evaluate each option's impact on the claim:**\n    *   A: Highlights the economic impact of the bridge's limitations but doesn't address the need for rebuilding.\n    *   B: Suggests most large ships don't pass the bridge, weakening the claim of it being a significant hindrance.\n    *   C: Points out similar limitations in other bridges, suggesting a broader issue than just the Nanjing bridge.\n    *   **D: Presents a technological solution (specially designed ships) that directly addresses the problem of large ships passing the bridge, raising the most doubt about the need for demolition.** \n3.  **Choose the option with the strongest counter-argument:** Option D provides the most compelling reason to doubt the expert's claim by demonstrating that technological advancements can overcome the bridge's limitations without demolition.\n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the core argument or claim being made.**\n2.  **Analyze each option to understand how it relates to the core argument.**\n3.  **Prioritize options that directly address the feasibility or necessity of the proposed action.**\n4.  **Consider technological or alternative solutions that may challenge the initial assumption.**\n5.  **Choose the option that raises the most doubt or provides the strongest counter-argument.**\n## General Advice\n*   **Think critically and consider multiple perspectives before forming a conclusion.**\n*   **Be open to alternative solutions and technological advancements that can change the context of a problem.**\n*   **Don't focus solely on finding contradictions; evaluate the strength and relevance of each counter-argument.**\n*   **Practice active reading and comprehension to fully grasp the nuances of complex problems.**\n"
