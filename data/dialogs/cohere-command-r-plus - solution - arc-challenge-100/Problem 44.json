When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?\nChoices:\n  A: The force of gravity acting on the car increases.\n  B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.\n  C: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.\n  D: The forces influencing the car are balanced.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nWhen the toy car moves from the inclined track to the flat surface, the forces influencing it change. On the incline, the force of gravity has two components: one parallel to the surface, contributing to the car's acceleration, and one perpendicular to the surface, which is counteracted by the normal force of the surface. When the car reaches the flat surface, the parallel component of gravity disappears, and only the perpendicular force remains, now balanced by the normal force from the flat surface. This change in forces results in a decrease in the car's speed.\n"
