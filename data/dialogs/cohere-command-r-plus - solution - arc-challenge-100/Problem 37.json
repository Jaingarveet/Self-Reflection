Migrating, hibernating, and building nests are all examples of animal instincts. However, hunting skills are not solely instinctual and involve learning and adaptation. Therefore, the correct answer is \"C: hunting skills\".\n\nReflection: The question asks for the answer that is \"not an example of animal instinct.\" I initially selected \"D: building nests\" as birds build intricate nests, but this is indeed an instinctual behavior. I missed that hunting involves a level of skill development and is not solely instinctual.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
