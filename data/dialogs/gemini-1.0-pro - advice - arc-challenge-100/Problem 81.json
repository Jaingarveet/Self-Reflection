I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Thought:**\nThe Sun is a very bright object, and looking directly at it can cause serious eye damage. Therefore, students must take precautions when making observations of the Sun.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")\n**Explanation:**\nProjecting the image of the Sun onto a piece of cardboard is a safe way to observe the Sun. This is because the image is not as bright as the Sun itself, and it is therefore less likely to cause eye damage.\n**Reflection:**\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully consider the safety precautions that must be taken when observing the Sun. I have now reflected on my mistake and I am confident that I can answer the question correctly in the future."
