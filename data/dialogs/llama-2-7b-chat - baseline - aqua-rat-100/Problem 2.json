The average weight of the group of vehicles before the new truck was added is 12.2 tons, and the average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons after the new truck was added.\n\nAction: Let's use the formula for the arithmetic mean to find the weight of the heavy duty truck. The formula is:\n\nArithmetic mean = (x1 + x2 + ... + xn) / n\n\nwhere x1, x2, ..., xn are the values of the variables we are averaging, and n is the number of values.\n\nIn this case, the values are the weights of the 10 vehicles, which are given as 12.2 tons. So, we can plug this value into the formula:\n\nArithmetic mean = (12.2 + 12.2 + ... + 12.2) / 10\n\nSimplifying the formula, we get:\n\nArithmetic mean = 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons\n\nSo, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 44.8 tons (answer choice E).\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
