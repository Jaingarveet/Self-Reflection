        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nWe are given that X and Y are two alloys made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratios 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. Let's call the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X 6:9, which means that for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. Similarly, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, which means that for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper.\n\nNow, let's say we have 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. We want to mix them together to form alloy Z. Since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, the amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is 6 x 40 = 240 grams, and the amount of copper is 9 x 40 = 360 grams. Similarly, the amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is 7 x 60 = 420 grams, and the amount of copper is 11 x 60 = 660 grams.\n\nWhen we mix these two alloys together, the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 240 + 420 = 660 grams, and the total amount of copper is 360 + 660 = 1020 grams. So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\nZinc:Copper = 660:1020 = 69:101\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) 69:101."
