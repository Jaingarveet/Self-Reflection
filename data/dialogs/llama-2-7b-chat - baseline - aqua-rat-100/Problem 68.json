So, we can divide both integers by their GCF to simplify the problem.\n\nLet's say the smaller integer is x. Then, the larger integer is 3x.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 3x and x is 7700.\n\nSo, we can write:\n\n3x × x = 7700\n\nNow, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 3:\n\nx × x = 23100\n\nNow, we can find the value of x by dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = 11550\n\nNow, we can find the value of the other integer by using the fact that the GCF of 3x and x is 11:\n\n3x = 31550\n\nSo, the other integer is 31550.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
