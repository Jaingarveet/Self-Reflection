So, the train fare for one person is:\n\nTrain fare = 4/3 Ã— Bus fare\n\nWe are given that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus is Rs.1512. So, the bus fare for one person is:\n\nBus fare = Total fare / Number of persons\n= 1512 / 6\n= 252\n\nNow, we are also given that the train fare for 8 persons is Rs.1512. So, the train fare for one person is:\n\nTrain fare = Total fare / Number of persons\n= 1512 / 8\n= 189\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
