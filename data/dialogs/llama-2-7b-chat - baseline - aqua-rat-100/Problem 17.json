        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nThe production cost per component is $110, and the company produces 420 units per month. So, the total production cost per month is:\n\n420 units x $110 per unit = $46,800 per month\n\nThe company sells all the components by the end of each month, so the total revenue per month is:\n\n420 units x selling price per unit = $46,800 per month\n\nTo guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly revenue of at least:\n\n$626,400 = 12 x $51,300 (since there are 12 months in a year)\n\nNow, we can set up an equation based on the information given:\n\nRevenue per month = Production cost per month\n\nSo, we can solve for the selling price per component:\n\nSelling price per component = Revenue per month / Production cost per month\n\nSubstituting the values given in the question:\n\nSelling price per component = $46,800 / $110 per unit = 426\n\nSo, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is:\n\nAnswer: B - 230\n\nTherefore, the company should sell the components for at least $230 per unit to ensure a yearly profit of at least $626,400."
