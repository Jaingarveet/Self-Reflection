To find the distance traveled in 21 minutes, we need to calculate the total time taken to travel a certain distance at a reduced speed.\n\nAction:\nLet's first calculate the time taken to travel a distance of 1 mile at a reduced speed of 11 mph (15 mph - 4 mph).\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 1 mile / 11 mph = 0.09 miles/minute\n\nNow, we know that Bill travels for 21 minutes, so the total distance traveled is:\n\nDistance = Time x Speed = 0.09 miles/minute x 21 minutes = 1.89 miles\n\nAction:\nNow, let's choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n\nAnswer: B: 2.25 miles\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B, 2.25 miles, as it is the closest estimate to the actual distance traveled by Bill in 21 minutes, which is 1.89 miles."
