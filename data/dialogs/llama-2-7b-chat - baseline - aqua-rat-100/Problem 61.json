        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nWe know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the distance between A and B is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 70 mph x 3 hours = 210 miles\n\nNow, we are told that Kevin turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. So, the time it took him to return to A is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed = 210 miles / 90 mph = 2.33 hours\n\nWe are also given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n70 miles + 3 hours = x miles + 3 hours (where x is the distance between A and B)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 280 miles\n\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is 280 miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
