Mark will have Rs.75 if he gives John one third of his money.\n2. John will have Rs.37.50 if Mark gives him half of his money.\n\nWe can set up a proportion to relate these two statements:\n\nMark's money = John's money / 3\n\nSolving for John's money, we get:\n\nJohn's money = Mark's money x 3\nJohn's money = Rs.75 x 3\nJohn's money = Rs.225\n\nSo, John had Rs.225.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
