Each letter can be used once or twice, so there are 5 letters in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of possible combinations of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers:\n\n* AA: 2 combinations (A and B, A and E)\n* AB: 3 combinations (A and B, A and D, A and F)\n* AC: 3 combinations (A and C, A and D, A and E)\n* AD: 2 combinations (A and D, A and F)\n* AE: 2 combinations (A and E, A and F)\n* AF: 1 combination (A and F)\n* BA: 2 combinations (B and A, B and E)\n* BB: 2 combinations (B and B, B and F)\n* BC: 3 combinations (B and C, B and D, B and E)\n* BD: 2 combinations (B and D, B and F)\n* BE: 3 combinations (B and E, B and D, B and F)\n*BF: 2 combinations (B and F, B and E)\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is:\n\n7 x 6 = 42\n\nSo, the answer is (D) 65000."
