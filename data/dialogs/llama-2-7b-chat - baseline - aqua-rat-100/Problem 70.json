Therefore, the time difference between the two services is:\n\n5:02 AM - 5:00 AM = 2 minutes\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability of the man catching the first train. Since the main line service starts at 5 o'clock, the man has a 50% chance of catching the first train if he arrives at the station at 5 o'clock.\n\nTherefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is:\n\n0.5 (50%)\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
