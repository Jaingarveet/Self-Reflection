So, the concentration of tea after this step is 50% x 0.85 = 42.5%.\n\nStep 2: John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. This means he dilutes the tea further by 10%. So, the concentration of tea after this step is 42.5% x 0.9 = 38.75%.\n\nTherefore, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 38.75%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
