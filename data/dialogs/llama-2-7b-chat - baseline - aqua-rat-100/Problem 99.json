We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring:\n\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the formula for conditional probability:\n\nP(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2\n\nSo, the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred is 0.2.\n\nThe answer is (B): 0.2."
