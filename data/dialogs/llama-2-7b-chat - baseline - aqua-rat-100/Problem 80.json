So, if he buys x white sharpeners, he will pay x + 1 rupees.\n\nLet's assume the number of white sharpeners he buys is w. Then, the number of brown sharpeners he buys is 18 - w.\n\nSo, the total amount he pays is:\n\nw(x + 1) + (18 - w)x = 100\n\nNow, we need to find the values of w and x that satisfy the equation.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
