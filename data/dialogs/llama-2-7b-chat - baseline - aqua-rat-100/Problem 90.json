        "content": "  Great, let's solve this problem step by step!\n\nWe know that the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.\n\nIf a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, then it will order:\n\nSunday papers = 2 x (total papers per week - Sunday papers)\n= 2 x (7 - 4)\n= 2 x 3\n= 6 papers on Sunday\n\nNow, we know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. So, the total cost of newspapers for the week is:\n\nTotal cost = Number of papers x Cost per paper\n= 6 x $4\n= $24\n\nNow, we can find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday:\n\nMonday papers = Total cost / Cost per paper\n= $24 / $1\n= 24 papers on Monday\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 30."
