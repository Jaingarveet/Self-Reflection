So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500\n\nNow, we need to solve for the monthly sales. We can do this by isolating the monthly sales term on one side of the equation:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500\n\nSubtracting $500 from both sides gives us:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 5% to find the monthly sales:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) / 5% = $1000\n\nMonthly sales = $20,000\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
