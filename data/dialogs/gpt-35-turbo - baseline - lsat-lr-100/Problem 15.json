Therefore, the argument is flawed. Choice A is incorrect because it is not relevant to the argument. Choice C is incorrect because Morgenstern's argument does not mischaracterize what Brooks says. Choice D is incorrect because Morgenstern's argument does not conflate two different types of risk. Choice E is incorrect because Morgenstern's argument is not based on a single case."
