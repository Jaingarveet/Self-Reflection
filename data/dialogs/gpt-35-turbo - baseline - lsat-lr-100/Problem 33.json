Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.\n  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.\n  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.\n  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.\n  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.\n"
