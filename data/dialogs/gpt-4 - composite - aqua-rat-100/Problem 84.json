I thought the chairs were distinct, but the problem states they are identical. This means the only thing that matters is the order of the children, not the specific chair they sit in. \nError Keywords:\n- Combinatorics error\n- Arrangement error\n- Misinterpretation error\nSolution:\nThe condition is that Susan must be on the left of Tim. This leaves two possible arrangements: Susan, Tim, Zen and Susan, Zen, Tim. However, since the chairs are identical, these two arrangements are considered the same. Therefore, there is only one way to arrange the children so that Susan is on the left of Tim.\nInstructions:\n[REDACTED]. Understand the problem and the conditions given.\n[REDACTED]. Identify the number of objects (children) to be arranged.\n[REDACTED]. Determine the number of ways the objects can be arranged based on the conditions.\n4. Remember that if the chairs are identical, the specific chair each child sits in does not matter, only their order.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.\n- Be careful with problems involving arrangements or combinations, as they can be tricky.\n- Remember that if objects (like chairs) are identical, the specific object each item is placed on does not matter, only their order.\n- Always double-check your understanding of the problem and your final answer.\n"
