        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in solving the system of equations. I must have made an arithmetic error while solving the equations, which led to the incorrect answer.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Solving system of equations error\nSolution:\nLet's denote the amount of money Arjun has as [REDACTED] and the amount of money Sajal has as S. \nFrom the first condition, we have the equation: S + 30 = 2([REDACTED] - 30).\nFrom the second condition, we have the equation: [REDACTED] + 10 = 3(S - 10).\nSolving these two equations, we get:\nS = 2[REDACTED] - 60 and [REDACTED] = 3S - 30.\nSubstituting the value of S from the first equation into the second, we get:\n[REDACTED] = 3(2[REDACTED] - 60) - 30.\nSolving this equation, we get [REDACTED] = 62.\nSubstituting [REDACTED] = 62 into the first equation, we get S = 34.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the unknowns and denote them with variables.\n2. Translate the problem conditions into equations.\n3. Solve the system of equations.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Practice solving systems of equations to improve your skills.\n"
