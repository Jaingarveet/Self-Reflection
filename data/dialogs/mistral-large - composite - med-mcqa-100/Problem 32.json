Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?\nChoices:\n  A: Rhinoscleroma\n  B: Wegener's granulomatosis\n  C: Stewa's granuloma\n  D: Rhinosporidiosis\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly diagnosed the patient with [REDACTED] based on the biopsy finding of granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and areas of necrosis. However, the correct diagnosis is [REDACTED], which is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misdiagnosis\n- Incorrect interpretation of biopsy findings\n- Failure to consider infectious etiology\n\nSolution:\nThe patient is a 60-year-old male who presents with right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood-tinged. The biopsy finding shows granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and areas of necrosis. However, the absence of fungal or bacterial infection on the biopsy does not rule out an infectious etiology. [REDACTED] is a chronic granulomatous infection that commonly affects the nasal mucosa and presents with similar symptoms. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying the characteristic spores of Rhinosporidium seeberi on histopathology.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully review the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.\n2. Consider both inflammatory and infectious etiologies.\n3. Recall that [REDACTED] is a chronic granulomatous infection that commonly affects the nasal mucosa and presents with similar symptoms.\n4. Confirm the diagnosis by identifying the characteristic spores of Rhinosporidium seeberi on histopathology.\n5. Double-check your diagnosis against the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always consider both inflammatory and infectious etiologies when evaluating a patient's symptoms.\n- Be aware of the limitations of biopsy findings and consider additional diagnostic tests as needed.\n- Recall common infectious etiologies that can present with similar symptoms.\n- Confirm the diagnosis with appropriate diagnostic tests.\n- Double-check your diagnosis against the patient's symptoms and diagnostic test results.\n"
