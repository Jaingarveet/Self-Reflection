This is most commonly seen in organs with a dual blood supply, such as the lung.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and consider the specific context.\n2. Identify the key concept being asked about (red infarcts).\n3. Consider the possible organs where this concept could occur.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice based on the specific context of the question.\n5. Choose the answer that best fits the specific context of the question.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and consider the specific context.\n - Avoid overgeneralizing based on general knowledge.\n - Evaluate each answer choice based on the specific context of the question.\n - Consider all possible options before making a decision.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure it fits the specific context of the question.\n"
