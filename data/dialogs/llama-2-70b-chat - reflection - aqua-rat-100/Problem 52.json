If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?\nChoices:\n  A: 69:91\n  B: 59:91\n  C: 59:90\n  D: 59:91\n  E: 69:101\n\n  Thought: \nTo find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y.\nLet the amount of zinc in alloy X be 6x grams and the amount of copper be 9x grams.\nLet the amount of zinc in alloy Y be 7y grams and the amount of copper be 11y grams.\nWhen 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed, the total amount of zinc is 6x + 7y grams, and the total amount of copper is 9x + 11y grams.\nWe can set up a proportion to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n(6x + 7y) / (9x + 11y) = (zinc in Z) / (copper in Z)\n\nWe can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:\n6x + 7y = 9x + 11y\n\nSubtracting 7y from both sides gives us:\n6x = 2y\n\nDividing both sides by 6 gives us:\nx = 2y/6\n\nSubstituting y = 11y/7 from the second equation, we get:\nx = 2(11y/7) / 6\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nx = 11y/14\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\nRatio of zinc in Z = 6x = 6(11y/14) = 11y/2\n\nRatio of copper in Z = 9x = 9(11y/14) = 11y/2\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 11y/2:11y/2, which simplifies to 1:1.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
