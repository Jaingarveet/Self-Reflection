If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source, how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins?\nChoices:\n  A: 8.5\n  B: 10.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 14.5\n  E: 16.5\n\n  Let X be the number of grams of health food to be eaten daily.\n\nSince 1 gram of health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, X grams will contain 9% of X grams = 0.09X\n\nSimilarly, since 1 gram of health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, X grams will contain 8% of X grams = 0.08X\n\nTo meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need 0.09X = 100% and 0.08X = 100%.\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\n\n0.09X = 100%\n0.08X = 100%\n\n0.09X = 0.08X\n\nX = 11.11\n\nSince the answer is rounded to the nearest integer, we have:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") 10.5\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
