Identify the total number of items (10 oranges).\n2. Identify the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges).\n3. Recognize that the order of the items does not matter.\n4. Apply the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! \\* (n-k)!)\n5. Plug in the values: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! \\* (10-2)!)\n6. Simplify the expression: C(10, 2) = 45\n7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result: Answer(\"A\")\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always understand the concept of permutation and combination.\n* Recognize when the order of items matters and when it does not.\n* Apply the correct formula to solve the problem.\n* Simplify the expression to obtain the final answer.\n* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy."
