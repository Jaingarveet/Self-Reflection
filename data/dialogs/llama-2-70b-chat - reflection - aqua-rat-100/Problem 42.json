If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, which of the following represents the length of fence in feet?\nChoices:\n  A: 13x/2\n  B: 13x/2 - 6\n  C: 13x/24\n  D: (13x+1)/24\n  E: (13x-12)/24\n\n  Thought:\nLet's first calculate the total width of all the pickets.\nThe total width of all the pickets = x \\* 1/2 = x/2\n\nNow, we need to add the space between each pair of pickets.\nThe total width with spaces = x/2 + 6 = x/2 + 6\n\nThe length of the fence is the total width times the number of pickets.\nThe length of the fence = x/2 + 6 \\* 13 = 13x/2 + 78\n\nNow, let's check the given options:\n\nA: 13x/2 = 13(x/2) = 13x/4 = 13(13x/2 + 78) = 13(13x/2) = 13^2 x/4 = 169x/4 (This is not the correct answer)\n\nB: 13x/2 - 6 = 13(x/2) - 6 = 13x/4 - 6 = 13(13x/2 + 78) - 6 = 13(13x/2) - 6 = 13^2 x/4 - 6 = 169x/4 - 6 (This is not the correct answer)\n\nC: 13x/24 = 13(x/24) = 13x/48 = 13(13x/2 + 78) = 13(13x/2) = 13^2 x/48 = 169x/48 (This is not the correct answer)\n\nD: (13x+1)/24 = (13x + 1)/24 = 13(x/24) + 1/24 = 13x/48 + 1/24 = 13(13x/2 + 78)/48 + 1/24 = 13(13x/2)/48 + 1/24 = 169x/48 + 1/24 (This is not the correct answer)\n\nE: (13x-12)/24 = (13x - 12)/24 = 13(x/24) - 12/24 = 13x/48 - 12/24 = 13(13x/2 + 78)/48 - 12/24 = 13(13x/2)/48 - 12/24 = 169x/48 - 12/24 (This is not the correct answer)\n\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nThe correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.\n\nThe reasoning for this answer is as follows:\n\n1. The total width of all the pickets is x/2.\n2. The total width with spaces is x/2 + 6.\n3. The length of the fence is the total width times the number of pickets, which is x/2 + 6 \\* 13 = 13x/2 + 78.\n4. To find the length of the fence in feet, we need to convert the result from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide the result by 12: 13x/2 + 78 / 12 = (13x-12)/24.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* None of the above\n\nSolution:\n\n1.
