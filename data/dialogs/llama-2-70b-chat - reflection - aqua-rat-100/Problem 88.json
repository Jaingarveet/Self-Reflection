After covering quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the train has to be slowed to speed of 75 miles/hour. What is the total journey duration?\nChoices:\n  A: 10\n  B: 11.5\n  C: 12.5\n  D: 13.5\n  E: 15\n\n  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The train's original speed is 100 miles/hour, and it takes 10 hours to reach its destination.\n2. This means the train travels a total distance of 1000 miles (10 x 100).\n3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which is 250 miles (1/4 x 1000).\n4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles (1000 - 250) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75\nTime = 10\n\n5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance:\n\nTotal Time = 10 + 10\nTotal Time = 20\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
