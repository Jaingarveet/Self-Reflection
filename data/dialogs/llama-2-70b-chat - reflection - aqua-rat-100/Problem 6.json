After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\nChoices:\n  A: 7\n  B: 8\n  C: 10\n  D: 11\n  E: 12\n\n  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 6 = 18 days.\n2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, so he has painted 3 houses in 8 days.\n3. Mr. Black starts working after 8 days, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 days to paint 3 houses.\n4. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 8 = 24 days.\n5. Since Mr. Black has 10 days to paint 3 houses, he will finish in 10 days.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
