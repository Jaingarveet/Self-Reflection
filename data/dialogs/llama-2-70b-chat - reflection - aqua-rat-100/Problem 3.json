The square piece of cloth has side length x.\n2. After trimming 4 feet off one edge, the rectangle has a length of x - 4 and a width of x.\n3. The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle is 2 \\* 70 = 140 square feet.\n4. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(x - 4) + 2x = 2x - 8.\n5.
