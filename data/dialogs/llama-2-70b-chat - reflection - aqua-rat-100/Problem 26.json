Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I misunderstood the question and calculated the area of the square instead of the length of each side.\nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding the question\n- Calculation error\n- Area instead of length\nSolution:\nLet's first calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle:\nLength = 27 cm\nBreadth = 17 cm\n\nThe wire is bent to form a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square \"s\".\n\nWe know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the length of the wire.\nPerimeter of the square = s + s + s + s\n= 4s\n\nWe also know that the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length plus the breadth.\nPerimeter of the rectangle = Length + Breadth\n= 27 + 17\n= 44\n\nSince the wire is bent to form a square, the perimeter of the square must be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.\n4s = 44\n\nNow, we can solve for \"s\":\ns = 11\n\nSo, the length of each side of the square is 11 cm.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle.\n2. Calculate the perimeter of the square.\n3. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.\n4. Equate the perimeter of the square to the perimeter of the rectangle.\n5. Solve for the length of each side of the square.\n6. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Be careful when calculating perimeters and areas.\n- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n- Use the correct formula for the problem at hand.\n- Plug your answer back into the original equation to ensure it makes sense."
