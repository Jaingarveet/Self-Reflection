Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Which of the following represents the average speed, in miles per hour, for these two activities combined?\nChoices:\n  A: M + N / 8\n  B: 2M + N / 8\n  C: M + N / 4\n  D: M + 3N / 8\n  E: M + N / 5\n\n  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their running speed is M/4 miles per hour.\n2. The athlete then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their cycling speed is N/4 miles per hour.\n3. To find the average speed for both activities combined, we need to add the running and cycling speeds and divide by 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct formula is M + N / 4, which is choice C.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Let's reflect on the error and how to improve for the future.\n\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the formula for finding the average speed. I used the formula M + N / 4, which is the formula for finding the average of two speeds, not the average speed for both activities combined.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of formula\n* Lack of attention to detail\n* Failure to double-check work\n\nSolution:\nLet's re-solve the problem using the correct formula:\n\n1. The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their running speed is M/4 miles per hour.\n2. The athlete then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their cycling speed is N/4 miles per hour.\n3. To find the average speed for both activities combined, we need to add the running and cycling speeds and divide by 2.\n\nThe correct formula is (M + N) / 8, which is choice A.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the formula for finding the average speed for two activities.\n2. Apply the formula to the given information.\n3. Simplify the result, if possible.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the simplified result.\n5. Double-check the work to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always use the correct formula and apply it correctly.\n* Always double-check your work to ensure accuracy.\n* Don't assume the answer without thorough calculation.\n* Practice, practice, practice to build problem-solving skills.\n\nBy following these steps and advice, I can improve my performance in math problems and avoid similar mistakes in the future."
