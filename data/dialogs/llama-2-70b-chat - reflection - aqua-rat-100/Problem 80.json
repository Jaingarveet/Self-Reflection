How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices:\n  A: 10,8\n  B: 9,8\n  C: 7,8\n  D: 5,6\n  E: 11,12\n\n  Let W be the number of white sharpeners and B be the number of brown sharpeners.\nSince Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.\nThe total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees.\nThe cost of W white sharpeners is W + 1 rupees, and the cost of B brown sharpeners is B rupees.\nSince the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:\nW + 1 + B = 100\n\nWe know that W + B = 18 (total number of sharpeners)\n\nSubstituting W + B = 18 into the first equation, we get:\nW + 1 + B = 100\nW + B = 18\n\nSubtracting W from both sides of the second equation, we get:\nB = 18 - W\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for B into the first equation:\nW + 1 + (18 - W) = 100\n\nCombine like terms:\n2W + 1 = 100\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n2W = 99\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\nW = 49.5\n\nSince W is a whole number, W = 49.\n\nNow, we can find B:\nB = 18 - W\nB = 18 - 49\nB = -31\n\nSince B cannot be negative, this is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E: 11,12.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

I incorrectly assumed that the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners, when in fact, the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners. I also made a calculation error when solving for B. To avoid this mistake in the future, I should carefully read the problem and understand the cost of each item, write the equation for the total cost of all items, and solve for the variables carefully."
