[step] The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. Consider stopping caring about your work/colleagues criticism and you might feel more relaxed in the short term.\nChoices:\n  A: Richard templar says in the rules of wealth act as if you don't need the money and people will no longer have power over you. [title] Believe, from deep in your gut, that you can do better.\n  B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.\n  C: [substeps] Don't be afraid to look back on and the future. Remind yourself that it is impossible to work your way to the top, but soon you will be jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl.\n  D: Give your notice to somebody who simply deserves it. This is an integral part of the healthy and productive life you lead.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI selected answer choice D because it seemed to provide the most reasonable advice about moving on from an unhealthy work situation. However, upon further reflection and seeing the correct answer was A, I realize I missed some key context clues in the original text that pointed to a different intended message.\nThe text appears to be satirically presenting bad advice in an exaggerated, tongue-in-cheek way, not sincerely suggesting the reader stop caring about their work. Clues like the informal tone, odd phrasing like \"the lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go\", and the [header] label of \"How to escape extreme pressure employment\" indicate this is not a genuine self-help article.\nWith that lens, answer A actually provides the most fitting satirical continuation - suggesting you act like you don't need money and believe you can do better, as if those attitudes alone will resolve a toxic work environment. The Richard Templar reference and motivational platitudes match the satirical tone of the original text.\nError Keywords:\n- Missed context clues \n- Took satirical text at face value\n- Misinterpreted author's intent and tone\n- Didn't recognize exaggerated \"bad advice\"\nSolution:\nThe given text is written in an exaggerated, satirical style presenting intentionally questionable advice for dealing with a high-pressure job. Clues that this is tongue-in-cheek rather than sincere include:\n- The informal, conversational tone \n- Odd motivational phrases like \"The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go\"\n- The suggestion to \"stop caring\" as a solution\n- The [header] label presenting this as \"How to escape extreme pressure employment\"\nAnswer A provides the best continuation of this satirical tone, with references to acting like you don't need money and believing \"from deep in your gut\" that you can do better. This matches the style of exaggerated, unhelpful advice in the original text.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the given text carefully, paying attention to tone, word choice, and formatting clues.\n2. Ask yourself if the advice seems genuine and constructive, or exaggerated and tongue-in-cheek. \n3. Look for a continuation that matches the tone and style of the original text.\n4. Be wary of selecting an answer choice simply because it offers more \"reasonable\" advice, if it doesn't fit the passage.\n5. Consider the author's likely intent - are they sincerely giving advice or satirizing bad advice?\nAdvice:\n- Always read carefully for context clues about the author's tone and intent.\n- Be on the lookout for signs a text may be satirical, sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek rather than literal.\n- Consider how formatting elements like [headers] and [titles] can indicate a text's purpose or style.\n- Don't assume a \"straightforward\" answer is always correct, especially with an unconventional writing style.\n- Ask yourself if the given text and answer choices are genuinely trying to inform, or if they have a more satirical intent to entertain or critique.\n"
