[step] If you have calluses, try soaking your feet on a regular basis to soften the dry and dead skin. Softening the skin with a warm water and mild soap foot bath will make removing that skin much easier.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Fill a bowl with warm water and mild soap and add epsom salts. Gently immerse your feet in the bath for 10 to 15 minutes.\n  B: The softer the skin on your feet, the less likely calluses will develop. Soak any areas that you have calluses on for at least thirty minutes.\n  C: You may want to consider adding some dish soap to your foot bath to get your feet properly soaked. [title] Rinse off with warm water after soaking.\n  D: [substeps] Use warm water instead of hot water. Hot water can dry out your skin and irritate your feet.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose option A because it provided specific and relevant instructions for soaking feet to remove calluses.

Read the given text carefully to understand the context and purpose.\n2. Consider each choice and evaluate its relevance and importance to the given text.\n3. Prioritize information that is necessary, cautionary, or directly enhances the process described in the text.\n4.
