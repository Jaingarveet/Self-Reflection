It also mentions that in many cases, it is impossible to cater to voters without writing many empty checks. Given that Cheng Bian was elected, it is likely that he did write many empty checks to voters. Therefore, the best conclusion to derive from the question stem is that Cheng Bian probably wrote many empty checks to voters, which is option [REDACTED].\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect format\n* Did not provide answer in the correct format\n* Answer must be stated in the format \"Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")\"\n* [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice\n\nSolution:\n1. Read the question stem carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the conclusion that can be derived from the argument.\n3. Choose the answer choice that matches the derived conclusion.\n4. State the answer in the correct format: \"Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")\".\n5. Double-check the answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nInstructions:\n1.
