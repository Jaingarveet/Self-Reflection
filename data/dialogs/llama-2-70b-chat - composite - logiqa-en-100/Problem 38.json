Identify the common food source for crocodiles and seals.\n2. Evaluate the impact of shared food sources on the population dynamics of both species.\n3. Consider alternative factors that may affect the population of crocodiles, such as environmental changes or overfishing.\n4. Re-assess the argument that seals caused the reduction of crocodiles in light of the new information.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Always consider all relevant factors that may affect the relationship between different species.\n2. Evaluate the impact of shared resources on population dynamics.\n3. Avoid oversimplifying complex ecological relationships.\n4. Consider alternative explanations for population changes.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that it is based on accurate information and sound logic.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always approach ecological problems with a holistic perspective.\n - Consider the interconnectedness of different species and their environments.\n - Avoid jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.\n - Be open to alternative explanations and consider their validity.\n - Use a systematic approach to evaluate complex ecological relationships.\n"
