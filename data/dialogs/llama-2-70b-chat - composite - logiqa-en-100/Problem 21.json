At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the description of Xiao Wang's method of refutation. I thought Xiao Wang provided an alternative explanation for the flickering light emitted by Comet 1996D3, which is not what the question asked for.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Misinterpretation\n* Incorrect focus\n\nSolution:\nXiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's view by pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument was based on an unusual scene, which is not a reliable basis for conclusion. Xiao Wang did not provide an alternative explanation for the flickering light emitted by Comet 1996D3. Instead, Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument was lacking in persuasion.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the focus of the problem.\n2. Identify the method of refutation used by Xiao Wang.\n3. Focus on the key point of Xiao Wang's refutation.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that do not match Xiao Wang's method of refutation.\n5. Choose the answer that best matches Xiao Wang's method of refutation.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the focus of the problem.\n* Pay attention to the key points of the argument and the method of refutation.\n* Eliminate answer choices that do not match the method of refutation.\n* Choose the answer that best matches the method of refutation.\n* In logic questions, it is important to focus on the logical relationships between the arguments and the method of refutation.\n"
