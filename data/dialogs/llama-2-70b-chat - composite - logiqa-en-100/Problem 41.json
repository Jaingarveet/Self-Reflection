This implies that if the company fails to increase productivity by 20%, it will not achieve its goal and will go bankrupt. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\n\n[REDACTED]: This statement is not necessarily true. Even if Green Island fails to achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it may still be able to avoid bankruptcy if it increases productivity by 10%.\n\n[REDACTED]: This statement is false. According to the argument, Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy, regardless of whether the market changes.\n\n[REDACTED]: This statement is impossible. If Green Island increases productivity by 10% over the next two years, it will have achieved its goal of increasing productivity by 20%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach this type of question.\nWhen faced with a question that contains redacted text, it's essential to use the information provided in the question to infer the missing information. In this case, the question states that the argument states that if Green Island increases productivity by 10%, it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%. This implies that if the company fails to increase productivity by 20%, it will not achieve its goal and will go bankrupt.\nTherefore, the correct answer is the option that states if Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.\nIt's important to carefully read the options and eliminate any options that are not necessarily true or are false based on the information provided in the question. In this case, options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] can be eliminated because they are not necessarily true or false. Option [REDACTED] can also be eliminated because it is impossible.\nUltimately, the correct answer is the option that logically follows from the information provided in the question. In this case, that option is [REDACTED].\nIt's always a good idea to reflect on your answers and consider where you went wrong. In this case, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. Reflecting on your answer can help you identify areas where you need to improve your critical thinking skills and help you avoid making similar mistakes in the future."
