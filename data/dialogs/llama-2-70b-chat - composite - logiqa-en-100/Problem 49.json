We have deduced that \"Doximayo\" means \"student.\"\n\nChoice B: \"Doximayo\" means \"student.\"\nThis is correct.\n\nChoice C: \"Mugbudengs\" means \"kidnapping.\"\nThis is correct.\n\nChoice D: I don't know what they mean.\nThis is incorrect. We have deduced the meanings of \"Doximayo,\" \"Mugbudengs,\" and \"Ftoufgke.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice B: \"Doximayo\" means \"student.\""
