The woman continues to have her hair styled while turned away from the camera. the woman\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is (B) finishes getting her hair styled by another woman.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text states that the woman is seated facing the camera while another woman styles her hair. This implies that the second woman is working on the woman's hair while she is turned away from the camera. Therefore, the most likely completion is that the second woman is finishing the hair styling process.\n\n(A) spins slowly in front of the camera showing the completed hairstyle does not fit the scenario as there is no indication that the woman is spinning or showing off her hairstyle.\n\n(C) speaks to the camera as the camera pans around camera angles does not fit the scenario as there is no indication that the woman is speaking or that the camera is panning around.\n\n(D) switches hair accessories and twists her hair into a style for the camera does not fit the scenario as there is no indication that the woman is switching hair accessories or twisting her hair.\n\nIn this case, I should have considered the practicality of the situation and chosen the option that best fits the scenario.
