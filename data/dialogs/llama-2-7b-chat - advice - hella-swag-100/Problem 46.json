The correct answer is (C) brings another wheelbarrow full of mulch and rakes it out over the lawn. This is because the text states that the man rakes the mulch out over the ground, which implies that he is adding more mulch to the lawn, not removing dirt or blowing it around.\n\nTo improve my answer, I will pay closer attention to the language used in the text and make sure to read it carefully before answering. I will also consider the context of the situation and the actions that are likely to occur based on the information provided.\n\nAdvice:\nWhen answering questions, it is important to read the text carefully and consider the context of the situation. It is also helpful to reflect on past mistakes and use them as an opportunity to improve future answers. By paying close attention to the language used in the text and considering the actions that are likely to occur, you can increase your chances of getting the correct answer."
