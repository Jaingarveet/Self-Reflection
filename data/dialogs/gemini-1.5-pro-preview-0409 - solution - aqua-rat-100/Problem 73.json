This means there must be some overlap between the two groups, as the total number of students exceeds 50%. \nTo minimize the total number of students, we should maximize the overlap. The maximum overlap occurs when 20% of students take both physics and math. In this case, the remaining 8% take only math. \nTherefore, the total percentage of students is 20% (both) + 20% (physics only) + 8% (math only) = 48%.\nTo find the least possible number of students, we need to find the smallest number greater than 501 that is divisible by 48.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
