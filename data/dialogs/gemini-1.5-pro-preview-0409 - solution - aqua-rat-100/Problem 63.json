What was the number of matches that the team lost?\nChoices:\n  A: 70\n  B: 30\n  C: 3\n  D: 7\n  E: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, so they won 100% - [REDACTED]% = [REDACTED]% of their matches.\nLet x be the total number of matches played.\nWe can set up the equation: 0.[REDACTED]x = 20 matches ([REDACTED]% of the total matches equals the number of wins)\nSolving for x, we get: x = 20 matches / 0.[REDACTED] = 28.[REDACTED][REDACTED] matches.\nSince a team cannot play a fraction of a match, we know the total number of matches must be a whole number less than 28.[REDACTED][REDACTED]. Therefore, the total number of matches is 28.\nThe number of losses is [REDACTED]% of 28 matches, which is 0.[REDACTED] * 28 matches = 8.4 matches.\nAgain, since a team cannot lose a fraction of a match, we round 8.4 down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the team lost 8 matches.\n"
