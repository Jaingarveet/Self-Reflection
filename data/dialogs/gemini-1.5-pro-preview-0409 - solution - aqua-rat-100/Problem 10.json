What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe speed calculation was correct: 700 meters / 40 seconds = 17.5 meters per second.\nThe time to pass a point is also correct: 5 seconds.\nHowever, the length of the space shuttle is not the distance it travels in those 5 seconds. The space shuttle travels its own length plus an additional distance in those 5 seconds. \nLet L be the length of the space shuttle.\nIn 5 seconds, the space shuttle travels 17.5 m/s * 5 s = 87.5 meters.\nTherefore, L + 87.5 meters = 700 meters (the height it reaches in 40 seconds).\nSolving for L, we get L = 700 meters - 87.5 meters = 612.5 meters.\nNow, we need to find the distance the space shuttle travels in 5 seconds due to its own length.\nThis distance is 612.5 meters - 700 meters = -87.5 meters (negative because it's the distance traveled before reaching the 700m mark).\nFinally, we divide this distance by the time to find the length of the space shuttle: -87.5 meters / 5 seconds = -17.5 meters/second.\nSince the length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value, which is 17.5 meters/second.\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 17.5 meters/second * 5 seconds = 87.5 meters.\nThe closest answer to this value is [REDACTED]eters.\n"
