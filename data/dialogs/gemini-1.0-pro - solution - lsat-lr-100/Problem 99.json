However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

If thinkers limit themselves to a specific orthodoxy, their intellectual progress is hindered.\n**Key Takeaway:**\n* Pay close attention to the professor's argument and identify the key assumptions that underpin it.\n* Avoid focusing on isolated statements and consider the overall logic of the argument.\n* Carefully analyze each answer choice and choose the one that best aligns with the professor's reasoning.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
