This led me to choose Answer Choice B, which claimed that Robinson's response didn't address Wexell's point.\n**Solution:** To avoid repeating this mistake, I will pay closer attention to the specific claims made in each argument and ensure I understand the core issue being debated before evaluating the strength of the responses.\n## Addressing the Current Question:\n1. **Wexell's Argument:** The museum wasted money buying props and costumes because they lack artistic significance outside of performances.\n2. **Robinson's Response:** The museum did not waste money because displaying the items is the only way to make them accessible to the public, even though they are too fragile for performances.\n3. **Addressing Wexell's Argument:** Robinson's response **partially** addresses Wexell's argument by acknowledging the fragility of the items and offering an alternative justification for their acquisition (public access). However, it **fails to directly address** the core issue of **artistic significance**. \n4. **Vulnerability of Robinson's Response:** The main vulnerability lies in **taking a condition sufficient for the conclusion (public access) as one that is necessary for the conclusion (no waste of money)**. Even if public access justifies the purchase, it doesn't negate the possibility that the items lack artistic value, as Wexell claims. \nTherefore, the reasoning in Robinson's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it:\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
