However, this is not a necessary condition for the argument to be valid.\n**Correct Answer:** D\n**Reasoning:** The argument takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is a flawed assumption, as many actions that are not motivated by a desire to produce a certain outcome can still produce that outcome. For example, a person who is motivated by a desire to make money may develop a technology that is also beneficial to society as a whole.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
