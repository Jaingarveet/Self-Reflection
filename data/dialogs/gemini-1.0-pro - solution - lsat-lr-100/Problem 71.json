Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.\nQuestion: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.\n  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.\n  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.\n  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Identify the key facts from the curator's statements:\n    - The museum displays only twentieth-century works.\n    - These works are either on loan or part of the museum's permanent collection.\n    - Prints of works in the permanent collection are available in the store.\n    - The store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Nighthawks.\n2. Analyze the answer choices based on these facts:\n    - [REDACTED] is incorrect because the store may sell prints of works not in the permanent collection.\n    - [REDACTED] is incorrect because the store might sell prints of works not displayed in the museum.\n    - [REDACTED] is correct because the curator guarantees prints for all non-loaned displayed works.\n    - [REDACTED] is incorrect; the curator doesn't confirm Nighthawks is on loan.\n    - [REDACTED] is incorrect; Nighthawks could be a non-20th-century work displayed on loan.\n"
