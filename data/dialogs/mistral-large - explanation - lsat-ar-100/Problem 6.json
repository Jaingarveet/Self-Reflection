The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the number of plays Jiang reviews.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not understanding that Jiang could review zero plays.\nI assumed that Jiang must review at least one play, but the conditions do not specify this.\n"

Since Lopez and Megregian cannot review any play Jiang reviews, and Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, Jiang must be reviewing zero plays.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nJiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does, because Jiang reviews zero plays and Lopez reviews at least one play (fewer than Megregian, but still at least one). The other answer choices cannot be true because we don't know how many plays Megregian, O'Neill, or Kramer review, only that Megregian reviews more than Kramer and Lopez, and that O'Neill and Kramer both review Tamerlane."
