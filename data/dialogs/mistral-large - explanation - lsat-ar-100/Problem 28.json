The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R.

If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the selection criteria and overlooked a crucial detail in the question.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the subject matter but in my understanding of the problem.\nI misunderstood the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\nI also overlooked the fact that [REDACTED] cannot be selected because it would require both [REDACTED] and R to be selected, which is not possible since Q is already selected.\n\nError [REDACTED]eywords:\n - [REDACTED]isunderstanding of selection criteria\n - Overlooking crucial details\n - [REDACTED]isinterpretation of conditional statements\n"
