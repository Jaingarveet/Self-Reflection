The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the selection of botanists.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not understanding that more than one botanist could be selected if only one zoologist is selected, as long as there is at least one scientist of each type.\nI also overlooked the fact that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which means that all three zoologists must be selected.\n"
