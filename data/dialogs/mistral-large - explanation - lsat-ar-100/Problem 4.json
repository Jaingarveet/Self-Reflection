Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.\nI misinterpreted the constraint that \"[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions that meet on the same day\" to mean that they must lead sessions on the same day of the week, rather than the same day of the lab schedule.\nI also overlooked the constraint that \"[REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s.\"\n"
