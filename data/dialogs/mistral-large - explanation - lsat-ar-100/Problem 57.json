Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?\nChoices:\n  A: George and Lenore\n  B: Helen and Nina\n  C: Irving and Robert\n  D: Kyle and Nina\n  E: Olivia and Kyle\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the conditions for Helen and Irving giving reports.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in understanding the conditions of the problem.\nI misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n"
