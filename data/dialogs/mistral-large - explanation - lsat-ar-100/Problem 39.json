The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nQuestion: If the works selected include three French novels, which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the remaining works selected?\nChoices:\n  A: one Russian novel\n  B: two French plays\n  C: one Russian novel, one Russian play\n  D: one Russian novel, two French plays\n  E: two Russian novels, one French play\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the requirement that \"at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected\" to mean that the number of French novels must always be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels. However, this requirement only applies to novels, not to the total number of works selected.\n"
