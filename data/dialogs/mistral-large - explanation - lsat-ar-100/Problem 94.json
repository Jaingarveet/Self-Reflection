Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning by not considering all the possible options for the restaurants.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.\nI knew the correct constraints but made a reasoning error.\n"

Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.\n\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Since the pharmacy is at one end and one of the restaurants at the other, the only possible way to separate the two restaurants by at least two other businesses is to have one restaurant in space 1 and the other in space 7.\n\nThe toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nI made an error in my reasoning by not considering all the possible options for the restaurants. I knew the correct constraints but made a reasoning error. This time, I considered all the possible options for the restaurants and made sure that all the constraints were satisfied. I also made sure that the toy store was not next to the veterinarian."
