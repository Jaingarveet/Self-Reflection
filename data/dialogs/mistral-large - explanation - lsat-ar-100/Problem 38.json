K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the placement of the books based on the given conditions.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.\nI misunderstood the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, assuming that the bottom shelf must have at least four books.\nI also overlooked the possibility that K could be placed on the top shelf with G, leaving room for L to be placed on the middle shelf with I.\n"
