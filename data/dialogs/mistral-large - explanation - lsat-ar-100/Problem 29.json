At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an incorrect assumption about the placement of the books.\nThe gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.\nI misinterpreted the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf to mean that the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\nI also overlooked the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M.\n"

This means that L cannot be on the bottom shelf, so it must be on the middle shelf. Since I is already on the middle shelf, and there must be at least two books on each shelf, there cannot be any more books on the middle shelf. Therefore, L must be on the top shelf.\n\nSince K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is placed on the same shelf as M, neither K nor O can be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, they must both be on the top shelf.\n\nSince there must be at least two books on each shelf, and we already have H on the bottom shelf, there must be at least one more book on the bottom shelf. Since F and M must be together, and they cannot be on the top shelf with K and O, they must be on the bottom shelf.\n\nTherefore, the books are placed as follows:\n\n* Top shelf: K, O, L\n* Middle shelf: I\n* Bottom shelf: H, F, M\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") (H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.)"
