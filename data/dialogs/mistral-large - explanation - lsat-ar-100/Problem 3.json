Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

        "content": "Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces. Specifically, I overlooked the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n\nThought:\nSince Robertson is assigned parking space #3, Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than #3. Therefore, Young can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2.\n\nAdditionally, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa can only be assigned parking space #1.\n\nSince Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is already assigned parking space #3, Xu can only be assigned parking space #4, #5, or #6.\n\nTherefore, Souza can only be assigned parking space #2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nSince Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, and Young can only be assigned parking space #1 or #2, Togowa must be assigned parking space #1. However, since Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #1, the only remaining option is that Togowa is assigned parking space #2. Therefore, the correct answer is \"B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\""
