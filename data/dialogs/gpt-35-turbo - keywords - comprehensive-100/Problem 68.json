Therefore, we have two equations:\n$$k = \\frac{32}{m}$$\n$$2 = \\frac{k}{m}$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the line. Solving for $k$ in terms of $m$ in the second equation gives $k = 2m$. Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$$2m = \\frac{32}{m}$$\nMultiplying both sides by $m$ and simplifying gives:\n$$2m^2 = 32$$\n$$m^2 = 16$$\n$$m = \\pm 4$$\nSubstituting $m = 4$ into $k = 2m$ gives $k = 8$, which is one of the answer choices.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
