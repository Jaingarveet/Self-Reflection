After re-reading the question and my response, I realized that I misunderstood the question.\n\nThe correct answer is A: Only by doing the best in at least one thing can your company gain a foothold in the market competition.\n\nThe paragraph highlights the importance of being great in at least one aspect to succeed in market competition. It emphasizes that if others are doing as well, then being faster than them is important, and if others are equally fast, then having a lower cost than them is essential.
