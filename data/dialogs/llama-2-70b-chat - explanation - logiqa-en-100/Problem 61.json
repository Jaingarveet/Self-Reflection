However, I can offer some general advice on how to approach this type of question.\nWhen faced with a question that involves a set of conditions and requirements, it's essential to create a systematic approach to ensure that all conditions are met. In this case, we know that there are six general manager assistants F, G, H, I, M, and P, and three departments. Our goal is to assign these assistants to departments in a way that meets the given conditions.\n1. There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at a time.\n2. F and G are not in charge of the same department.\n3. H and I are not in charge of the same department.\n\nTo start, we can assign F to department 1. Since F and G cannot be in charge of the same department, we can assign G to department 2. Now, we have two assistants left, H and I, and two departments left, department 3 and department 1.\nSince H and I cannot be in charge of the same department, we can assign H to department 3 and I to department 1.\nThe only assistant left is M, and we know that M and F are not in charge of the same department. Therefore, M must be in charge of department 2.\nFinally, we have P, who can be assigned to any of the three departments.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nOption A: F and H are in charge of the same department. This violates condition 2, as F and H cannot be in charge of the same department.\n\nOption B: F and I are in charge of the same department. This violates condition 3, as F and I cannot be in charge of the same department.\n\nOption C: I and P are in charge of the same department. This is possible, but it doesn't necessarily have to be true.\n\nOption D: M and G are in charge of the same department. This violates condition 1, as there can only be one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at a time.\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct answer is option C: I and P are in charge of the same department.\n\nIn summary, to answer this type of question, it's crucial to create a systematic approach that ensures all conditions are met. By carefully analyzing the given information and using logical reasoning, you can determine the correct answer."
