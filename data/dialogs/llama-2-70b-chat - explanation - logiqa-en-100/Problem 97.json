Upon reflection, I realized that option A is not relevant to the argument at hand. The phrase \"Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles\" does not provide any evidence to support or weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, provides a plausible explanation for the increase in posts related to negative social issues. If the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, it's possible that the increase in negative posts is simply a result of a larger user base, rather than a deterioration in the social atmosphere. This weakens the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating, as it suggests that the increase in negative posts may not be a reflection of a change in society, but rather a result of a larger population of Internet users.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer."
