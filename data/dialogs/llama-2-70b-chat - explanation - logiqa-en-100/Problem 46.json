F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nWe know that F must be in the production department, and condition 1 dictates that H and Y must be together. Thus, we can allocate H and Y in the sales department, leaving G, X, W, and I for the remaining two departments.\n\nNow, consider the following scenarios:\n\n1. If G and X are in the same department (sales or production), then condition 2 is violated.\n2. If G and I are in the same department (sales or production), then condition 1 is violated (H and Y must be together).\n3. If H and W are in the same department (sales or production), then condition 3 is violated (X is not in the sales department).\n\nTherefore, the only pair that cannot be assigned to the sales department is H and W, as it would violate condition 3.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
