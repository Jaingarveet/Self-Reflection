However, I can provide general guidance on how to approach the question.\nThe question requires analyzing the given statements and identifying the one that best explains the change in the problem. \nTo answer the question, one should consider the context of the change in the problem, which is the transition from the competition of the enterprise to the competition of the industry. \nThe correct answer should address this shift in focus and explain how the change in the problem affects the criteria for success.\nTherefore, one should carefully evaluate each option, considering how well it aligns with the change in the problem and its implications for success.\nUltimately, the answer should be based on a thorough analysis of the given options and their relevance to the problem's change."
