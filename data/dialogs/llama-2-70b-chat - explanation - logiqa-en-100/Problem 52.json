Therefore, the best conclusion that can be drawn from the given statement is that if the employee holds shares in the enterprise, there is no conflict of interest between the boss and the employee. This is choice B.\n\nIt's important to note that the other choices are not supported by the given statement. Choice A suggests that employees holding shares in the enterprise creates a conflict of interest with the boss, but the statement does not provide any information about shares held by employees. Choice C suggests that employees not holding shares in the enterprise creates a conflict of interest between the boss and the employee, but again, the statement does not provide any information about shares held by employees. Choice D is not supported by the statement, as it only establishes an inverse relationship between cost and profit, and does not provide any information about the relative amounts of money made by the boss and employees."
