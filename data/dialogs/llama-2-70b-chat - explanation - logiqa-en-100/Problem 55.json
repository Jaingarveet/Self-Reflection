(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in front Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: Which of the following lists are acceptable arrangements for the second team's performance?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? H Middle? P After? K\n  B: Before? H Middle? L After? N\n  C: Before? G In? Q After? P\n  D: Before? G In? Q After? N\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood condition (6). I thought it said that H must be in team 2, but it actually says that Q must be in the middle of team 1 if H is in team 2. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: Before? G Middle? Q After? N.\n"
