The data shows that housing prices increased by 7.2% while land prices rose by 0.37%, which suggests that the increase in housing prices may not be solely due to the increase in land prices. This information contradicts the assertion in choice [REDACTED], which states that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the most doubtful of the assertion.\n\nChoice [REDACTED] provides data on the increase in housing and land prices in Shanghai, but it does not provide enough information to contradict the assertion. Choice [REDACTED] is a statement from the chairman of Yongtai Development Company, which suggests that high demand for housing is a factor in rising housing prices, but it does not directly address the relationship between land prices and housing prices.\n"
