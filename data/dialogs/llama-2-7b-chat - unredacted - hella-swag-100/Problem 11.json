[step] Shuffling randomizes the deck in order to introduce chance to the game. Not shuffling the cards could allow some players to predict the cards that will come up later, which would give these players an unfair advantage.\nChoices:\n  A: There are different ways to shuffle, but a poker shuffle will typically consist of two riffles, a box, another riffle, and a cut. [substeps] A riffle refers to splitting the cards in half and mixing them together by placing the corners of the cards in each half against each other and letting the cards go so they intermix.\n  B: [title] Take the \" left, \" \" right, \" and \" bring \" of the deck and place them in one of the center corners. [step] The ace of these cards should be the same card as the one that will be dealt in poker.\n  C: [title] Shuffle the cards and place them in order. [step] For example, one or two cards-four of the \" sticks, \" four of the \" buckets, \" and a deck of jacks is a trump.\n  D: Showing players cards that played in others' hand normally means you can show them the actual cards that will go up in a moment. A deck that played in another player's hand can start out with potentially unfair odds, but you don't want this to happen.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nThank you for providing the feedback!

The other options do not involve shuffling the deck or do not make the game fair for all players.\n"
