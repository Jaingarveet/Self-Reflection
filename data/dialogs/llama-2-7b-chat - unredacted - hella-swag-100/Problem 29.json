[step] Chilblains can be extremely itchy, but scratching them may result in an infection. To ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, apply some calamine lotion or witch hazel onto your chilblains using a cotton ball.\nChoices:\n  A: This will leave your chilblains feeling soft and soothing. [substeps] Do not use witch hazel or similar products if you have sensitive skin.\n  B: Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. [substeps] You can also purchase witch hazel at a pharmacy or physician's office.\n  C: Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand. [substeps] Don't rub the lotion or witch hazel into your chilblains.\n  D: Repeat this cycle every day for up to three days until the itch is gone. [substeps] If you are not used to scratching or do not want to seek medical treatment for an itch, ask your doctor to prescribe.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose option C, \"Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand,\" as the correct answer because it accurately completes the text.

It does not specify which one is better or more effective, so using either option is a viable solution.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Inconsistent reasoning\n* Lack of clarity\n* Insufficient knowledge\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the problem, I used my knowledge of common sense and health-related information to complete the text. I understood that chilblains can be itchy and uncomfortable, and scratching them can lead to infection. I also knew that calamine lotion or witch hazel can be applied to ease the itchiness without scratching. By using this knowledge, I was able to complete the text accurately.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the problem or gap in reasoning.\n2. Use your knowledge and common sense to fill in the gap.\n3. Check your answer against the given options.\n4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always use your common sense and knowledge to solve problems.\n* Never assume that one option is better than another without sufficient evidence.\n* Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that common sense is not always common knowledge, so always verify your information.\n"
