Here is my answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe correct answer is (C) You're each entitled to your individual physical and emotional needs. This option acknowledges that each partner has their own needs and desires, and it's important to find ways to compromise and respect each other's boundaries. It's not about accepting that one partner's needs are more important than the other, but rather recognizing that both partners have the right to their own needs and desires. This approach can help deepen the bond between the partners in non-sexual ways."
