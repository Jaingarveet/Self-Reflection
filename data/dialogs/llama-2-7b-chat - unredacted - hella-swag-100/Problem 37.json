[step] That's easier said than done, especially if you're subbing for someone, but being late throws you off balance. It flusters you.\nChoices:\n  A: Many schools assign teachers and students to class at that time. Being too late gives the bus driver extra time to reschedule.\n  B: Having sit-down comfort is key to keeping your focus sharp. [title] Grab an umbrella if it's sunny.\n  C: When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot.\n  D: So find ways to be consistent about staying on time. Practice counting times out loud so that you're not distracted.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat job! Your explanation and answer are correct. Here's why:\n\nThe correct answer is option C: \"When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused. Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot.\"\n\nThis option is the most likely completion to the text because it addresses the main idea of the passage, which is how to maintain total focus while driving a school bus. The sentence \"Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot\" supports this idea by highlighting the importance of staying focused while driving, especially in a high-risk area like a school parking lot.\n\nWell done!\n"

        "content": "  Thank you for the feedback! I'm glad to see that my self-reflection helped me identify the correct answer. Here's my reasoning for choosing option C:\n\nWhen I initially read the passage, I noticed that the author was emphasizing the importance of being on time and maintaining focus while driving a school bus. The sentence \"That's easier said than done, especially if you're subbing for someone, but being late throws you off balance. It flusters you.\" made me realize that the author was highlighting the challenges of driving a school bus, especially for substitute drivers who may not be familiar with the route or the students.\n\nThen, when I reached the step section, I saw the sentence \"When you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, you're not thinking clearly and not totally focused.\" This sentence stood out to me because it directly related to the main idea of the passage, which is maintaining focus while driving a school bus. The phrase \"running around like a chicken with its head cut off\" is a common idiom that means to be frantically or chaotically moving around, which is exactly what the author is trying to convey - the driver needs to be fully focused and alert while driving, rather than being flustered or distracted.\n\nFinally, the sentence \"Many, many school bus accidents happen in the school parking lot\" further supports the idea that the driver needs to be fully focused and alert, especially in high-risk areas like the school parking lot. This sentence highlights the importance of maintaining total focus while driving, which is the main idea of the passage.\n\nOverall, I believe that option C is the most likely completion to the text because it addresses the main idea of the passage in a clear and concise manner."
