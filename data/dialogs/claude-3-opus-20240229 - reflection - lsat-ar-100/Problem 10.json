Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the organizer's selection of works?\nChoices:\n  A: one French novel, two Russian novels, one French play, one Russian play\n  B: two French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays, one Russian play\n  C: two French novels, two Russian novels, two French plays\n  D: three French novels, one Russian novel, two French plays\n  E: three French novels, two Russian novels, one Russian play\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The selection must have at least 5 and at most 6 works.\n2. No more than 4 French works can be selected.\n3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected.\n4. The number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.\n5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\nA: This selection has 5 works, no more than 4 French works, 3 novels, and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. It also includes both plays, which is allowed. This could be a valid selection.\nB: This selection has 6 works, but it includes both French plays and the Russian play, which violates requirement 5. This cannot be a valid selection.\nC: This selection has 6 works, no more than 4 French works, 4 novels, and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. This could be a valid selection.\nD: This selection has 6 works, but it includes 5 French works, which violates requirement 2. This cannot be a valid selection.\nE: This selection has 6 works, 4 French works, 5 novels, and more French novels than Russian novels. This could be a valid selection.\nAmong the given choices, A, C, and E could be valid selections.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly selected choice A as a possible selection. While choice A satisfies most of the requirements, it violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. Choice A includes all three plays, which is not allowed.\nError Keywords:\n - Overlooked constraint\n - Misinterpreted condition\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nLet's re-evaluate each choice considering all the requirements:\nA: Violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. Not a valid selection.\nB: Violates the same condition as A. Not a valid selection.\nC: Has 6 works total, 4 French works (2 novels + 2 plays), 4 novels (2 French + 2 Russian), and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. Satisfies all requirements. This is a valid selection.\nD: Has 5 French works, violating the requirement of no more than 4 French works. Not a valid selection.\nE: Has 5 novels, violating the requirement of no more than 4 novels. Not a valid selection.\nTherefore, only choice C could be the organizer's selection of works.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints.\n2. Evaluate each answer choice individually.\n3. For each choice, check if it satisfies every single requirement.\n4. If a choice violates any requirement, eliminate it.\n5. If a choice satisfies all requirements, keep it as a possible answer.\n6. After evaluating all choices, select the choice(s) that satisfy all the given constraints.\n7. If multiple choices satisfy all constraints, look for additional information to narrow down to one choice.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question and given information carefully.\n - Always consider all the given constraints when solving a problem.\n - Never ignore or forget about a condition or requirement.\n - Always evaluate each possibility systematically and thoroughly.\n - If a possibility violates any single requirement, it cannot be a valid solution.\n - Double-check that your answer satisfies every single given constraint."
