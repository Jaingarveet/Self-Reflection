        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?\nChoices:\n  A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.\n  B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\n  C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n\nTo determine which constraint would have the same effect as \"If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne,\" let's consider each choice:\nA) \"If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, so this would have the same effect.\nB) \"If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke\" does not involve Jaramillo or Kayne, so it would not have the same effect as the original constraint.\nC) \"If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship\" does not involve Jaramillo, so it would not have the same effect as the original constraint.\nD) \"Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships\" does not ensure that if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne is also assigned. This would not have the same effect as the original constraint.\nE) \"Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships\" does not involve Jaramillo or Kayne, so it would not have the same effect as the original constraint.\nTherefore, choice A is the only one that would have the same effect as the original constraint.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly chose answer A because I thought the contrapositive of the original statement would have the same logical effect. However, the original statement does not preclude the possibility of Kayne being assigned without Jaramillo. The correct answer, D, captures the full meaning of the original constraint by preventing Jaramillo from being assigned unless Kayne is also assigned.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical equivalence error\n - Contrapositive error\n - Implication error\n - Constraint interpretation error\nSolution:\nThe original constraint states: \"If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\" \nThis means that Jaramillo cannot be assigned unless Kayne is also assigned. However, it does not preclude Kayne from being assigned without Jaramillo.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA) \"If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo\" is the contrapositive, but it changes the meaning. It would force Jaramillo to be assigned whenever Kayne is, which is not the same as the original constraint.\nB) \"If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke\" is irrelevant to the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne.\nC) \"If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship\" is also irrelevant to the original constraint.\nD) \"Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships\" captures the essence of the original constraint. If Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be assigned because Kayne must be. This has the same effect as the original.\nE) \"Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships\" is once again irrelevant to the original constraint.\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the original constraint and understand its full implications.\n2. For each answer choice, determine if it is logically equivalent to the original constraint.\n3. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the original constraint.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that change the meaning of the original constraint.\n5. Select the answer choice that captures the full meaning and effect of the original constraint.\nAdvice:\n - Always read constraints carefully and consider their full logical implications.\n - Be wary of contrapositives - they are not always logically equivalent in meaning.\n - Eliminate irrelevant answer choices first.\n - Always consider how each answer choice relates to and affects the original constraint.\n - Select the answer that most fully captures the meaning and effect of the original, without adding or removing implications."
