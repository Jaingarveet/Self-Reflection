Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n\nTo determine which choice fully determines the placement of all books, let's consider each choice and see if we can deduce the shelves for each book.\nGiven:\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n- K is on a higher shelf than F.\n- O is on a higher shelf than L.\n- F and M are on the same shelf.\nChoice A: I and M are on the same shelf (middle).\n- I and M are on the middle shelf.\n- F must also be on the middle shelf (same as M).\n- K must be on the top shelf (higher than F).\n- O must be on the top or middle shelf (higher than L).\nThis leaves G, H, and L, which could be arranged in multiple ways on the bottom shelf. Not fully determined.\nChoice B: K and G are on the same shelf.\n- K and G could be on the top or middle shelf.\n- F and M could be on the bottom or middle shelf.\n- O and L could be on any shelf depending on the placement of K and G.\nNot fully determined.\nChoice C: L and F are on the same shelf (bottom).\n- L and F are on the bottom shelf.\n- M is also on the bottom shelf (same as F).\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- K must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than F).\n- O must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than L).\nWith 3 books on the bottom shelf, 2 or 3 must be on the middle, and 0 to 2 on the top. The exact placement of G, H, K, and O is not fully determined.\nChoice D: M and H are on the same shelf (bottom).\n- M, H, and F are on the bottom shelf.\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- K must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than F).\n- O must be on the middle or top shelf (higher than L).\nSimilar to Choice C, the exact placement of G, K, L, and O is not fully determined.\nChoice E: H and O are on the same shelf (top).\n- H and O are on the top shelf.\n- L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (lower than O).\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- K must be on the top or middle shelf (higher than F).\n- F and M must be on the bottom shelf (lower than K, and to have more books on bottom than top).\n- This leaves G, which must be on the middle shelf.\nTherefore, with Choice E, the placement is fully determined:\nTop: H, O\nMiddle: G, I\nBottom: F, L, M, K\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly determined that Choice E fully specified the shelf placement for all books, when in fact Choice A is the correct answer. My error was in not carefully considering all possible arrangements for each choice. I jumped to a conclusion with Choice E without fully analyzing the constraints.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Hasty generalization\n - Failure to consider all possibilities\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n- K is on a higher shelf than F.\n- O is on a higher shelf than L.\n- F and M are on the same shelf.\nChoice A: I and M are on the same shelf (middle).\n- I and M are on the middle shelf.\n- F must also be on the middle shelf (same as M).\n- K must be on the top shelf (higher than F).\n- O must be on the top shelf (higher than L).\n- This leaves G, H, and L for the bottom shelf.\n- Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top, G, H, and L must all be on the bottom shelf.\nTherefore, the arrangement is fully determined:\nTop: K, O\nMiddle: F, I, M\nBottom: G, H, L\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the given conditions and constraints.\n2. Consider each answer choice one at a time.\n3. For each choice, try to deduce the shelf placement for each book based on the given information and the new condition in the choice.\n4. If a choice leads to multiple possible arrangements, eliminate it and move to the next choice.\n5. If a choice uniquely determines the shelf placement for all books while satisfying all conditions, select it as the answer.\n6. Double-check the selected answer by confirming it is the only choice that fully determines the arrangement.\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully read and understand all given information and constraints in a logic problem.\n - Consider each possibility systematically and thoroughly; don't jump to conclusions.\n - Eliminate choices that lead to multiple possible arrangements.\n - Select the choice that uniquely determines the solution while satisfying all conditions.\n - Double-check your answer to ensure it is fully consistent with the given information."
