Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n2. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n3. This means that the remaining three witnesses (Franco, Garcia, and Hong) must all testify on Tuesday to satisfy the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n4. We also know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n5. Therefore, it's impossible for all three remaining witnesses to testify on Tuesday while satisfying all the conditions.\nIn conclusion, the question presents an impossible scenario. If Jackson is the only witness on Monday, there's no way to schedule the other witnesses to meet all the given conditions.\nSince we must select one of the given choices, let's look at them:\nA, B, C, and D cannot be inferred from the information given and the impossible scenario.\nE is the only choice that must be true, because if Franco, Garcia, and Hong all testify on Tuesday (the impossible scenario), then Garcia would testify on the same day as Hong.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly concluded that the scenario was impossible if Jackson was the only witness on Monday. However, it is possible to schedule the other witnesses to meet all the conditions.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Incorrect inference\n - Overlooked possible solution\nSolution:\n1. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n3. This leaves Franco, Garcia, and Hong to testify on Tuesday.\n4. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n6. Therefore, Hong and either Franco or Garcia must testify on Tuesday.\n7. Since the question asks what must be true, Hong testifying on Tuesday is the only certain conclusion.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and note all the given conditions.\n2. Identify the fixed elements of the schedule (e.g., Jackson on Monday, Iturbe on Wednesday).\n3. Determine the possible placements for the remaining witnesses.\n4. Consider each condition and eliminate placements that violate the conditions.\n5. Look for conclusions that must be true based on the remaining possible placements.\n6. Select the answer choice that matches a necessary conclusion.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider all possible scenarios before concluding that something is impossible.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are not certain conclusions based on the given information.\n - If a question asks what must be true, look for the answer choice that is true in all possible scenarios.\n - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences beyond what the information strictly implies.\n - In scheduling problems, start with the most constrained elements and work towards the less constrained ones."
