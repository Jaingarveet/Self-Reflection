Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.\n  C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n\nOkay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. This is a fixed condition.\n2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This is also a fixed condition.\n3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. So Monday can have one or two witnesses.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday. This eliminates some possibilities.\n5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This further constrains the possibilities.\nNow, let's look at each choice:\nA: This is possible. If Franco testifies on Monday, Garcia could testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.\nB: This is not possible. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who would have to be on Wednesday in this scenario.\nC: This is possible. If Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday, the other conditions can still be met.\nD: This is possible. If Garcia testifies on Monday and Hong on Wednesday, the other conditions are met.\nE: This is possible. If Jackson is one of the two witnesses on Tuesday, Monday could have two witnesses and the other conditions are met.\nTherefore, the only choice that CANNOT be true is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly determined that choice E was possible, but it actually violates the conditions. I failed to consider that if Jackson testifies on Tuesday, and two witnesses testify on Monday, then the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday would be violated.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Constraint violation\n - Overlooking stated conditions\n - Witness scheduling error\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, Jackson \n- 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\n- Each witness testifies exactly once\n- Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day\n- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday \n- Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday\n- Hong does not testify on Monday\n- At least 1 witness testifies on Monday\nAnalyzing the choices:\nA) Possible. Franco on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, Garcia and Iturbe on Wednesday.\nB) Not possible. Iturbe testifies Wednesday, Franco can't be same day as Garcia.\nC) Possible. Garcia and Hong on Tuesday, 1-2 on Monday, Iturbe + 0-1 other on Wednesday. \nD) Possible. Garcia on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, Hong and Iturbe on Wednesday.\nE) Not possible. If Jackson is on Tuesday, and 2 are on Monday, then <2 would be on Tuesday.\nTherefore, E CANNOT be true.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and constraints.\n2. Identify the fixed constraints that must be met.\n3. Analyze each answer choice one by one.\n4. For each choice, check if it violates any of the given constraints.\n5. If a choice violates a constraint, rule it out as a possibility.\n6. Choose the answer that cannot be possible without violating constraints.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the constraints carefully and identify the non-negotiable ones.\n- Consider the implications of each constraint on the possible scenarios.\n- Methodically test each answer choice against the constraints.\n- Be careful not to introduce unstated assumptions.\n- Double-check that your answer does not introduce any constraint violations."
