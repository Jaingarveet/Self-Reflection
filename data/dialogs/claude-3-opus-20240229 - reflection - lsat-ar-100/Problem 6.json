Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\n\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. This means Megregian reviews at least 2 plays.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means the plays Jiang reviews are different from those reviewed by Lopez and Megregian.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. This is the only definite information we have about which specific play is reviewed by whom.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Given point 3, these two students must be Kramer and O'Neill.\nNow, let's look at the answer choices:\nA. We don't know how many plays Jiang and Lopez review, so this is not necessarily true.\nB. We don't know how many plays Jiang reviews, so this is not necessarily true.\nC. Megregian reviews at least 2 plays, but we don't know how many O'Neill reviews, so this is not necessarily true.\nD. We don't know how many plays Jiang and O'Neill review, so this is not necessarily true.\nE. Kramer and O'Neill review the same plays (at least Tamerlane), so this must be true.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI focused too much on the information given about specific students and plays, and failed to consider the implications of the total number of plays. There are only three plays in total, so Megregian reviewing at least 2 plays necessarily means he reviews more plays than Jiang.\nError Keywords:\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Failure to consider all relevant information\n - Failure to draw necessary conclusions\n - Overemphasis on specific details\nSolution:\n1. There are only three plays in total: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.\n2. Megregian reviews at least 2 plays, as Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n3. Jiang cannot review any of the plays Megregian reviews.\n4. Since there are only 3 plays total and Megregian reviews at least 2 of them, Jiang can review at most 1 play.\n5. Therefore, Megregian necessarily reviews more plays than Jiang.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the total number of items (plays, in this case) under consideration.\n2. Determine any definite lower or upper bounds on the number of items each person has.\n3. Consider the implications of these bounds in relation to the total number of items.\n4. Draw necessary conclusions based on these implications.\n5. Reread the question and answer choices carefully.\n6. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true based on your conclusions.\n7. Select the answer choice that must be true based on your analysis.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the big picture and total quantities involved, not just specific details.\n - Look for implied information and necessary conclusions, not just explicitly stated facts.\n - Eliminate answer choices methodically based on your deductions.\n - If an answer choice contains an absolute statement (e.g., \"must be true\"), look for any possible counterexample that disproves it.\n - Reread the question and answers carefully to ensure you are selecting an answer that is definitely true, not just possibly true."
