Write down the equation for work: W = (number of workers) x (hours worked per day) x (number of days)\n3. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days: W1 = x^3\n4. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days: W2 = y^3\n5. Calculate the ratio of W2 to W1: W2/W1 = y^3 / x^3\n6. Simplify the ratio by canceling out common factors: y^3 / x^3 = y^3 / x^2\n7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n"
