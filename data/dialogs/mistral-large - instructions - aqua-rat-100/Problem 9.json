This means that the cost price of each bag is 75% of the selling price.\nThe cost price of each bag is $100 \\* 0.75 = $75.\nThe profit made on each bag is $100 - $75 = $25.\nThe total profit made is $3,000.\nThe number of bags sold is $3,000 / $25 = 120.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I misread the question and calculated the number of bags sold based on the cost price instead of the profit made. I have now double-checked my calculations and ensured that I am answering the correct question. I have also followed the instructions provided and worked step-by-step through my mathematical calculations to ensure accuracy."
