I realized that I needed to set up an equation to represent the total fare paid by all 14 people.\n\nLet B be the bus fare for one person and T be the train fare for one person.\nAccording to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so:\n2B = (4/3)T\n\nThe total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512, so:\n6B + 8T = 1512\n\nNow, I can solve this system of equations to find the train fare for one person.\n\nThought:\nFirst, I'll solve the first equation for B:\nB = (2/3)T\n\nNext, I'll substitute this expression for B into the second equation:\n6(2/3)T + 8T = 1512\n\nSimplifying and solving for T, I get:\nT = 66\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
