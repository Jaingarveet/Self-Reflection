Therefore, I will have to re-evaluate my calculations to find the correct answer.\n\nThought (re-evaluated):\nI made an error in calculating the loss. The correct calculation is:\nLoss = Cost Price - New Selling Price = 25 - 25.75 = -0.75\nLoss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) \\* 100 = (0.75 / 25) \\* 100 = 3%\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
