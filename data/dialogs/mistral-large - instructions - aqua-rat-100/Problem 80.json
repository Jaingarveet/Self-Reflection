Then the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1.\nWe can set up another equation: x \\* b + (x + 1) \\* w = 100.\nNow we have two equations and two variables. We can solve them simultaneously.\nFirst, let's express \"b\" from the first equation: b = 18 - w.\nThen substitute it into the second equation: x \\* (18 - w) + (x + 1) \\* w = 100.\nExpanding and simplifying the equation, we get: 18x - xw + xw + w = 100.\nSo, 18x + w = 100.\nNow we can express \"w\" from this equation: w = 100 - 18x.\nSince \"w\" and \"b\" are both positive integers, we can try different values of \"x\" to find a suitable solution.\nIf x = 4, then w = 100 - 18 \\* 4 = 16. But 16 + b = 18 has no integer solution for \"b\".\nIf x = 5, then w = 100 - 18 \\* 5 = 8. And b = 18 - w = 18 - 8 = 10.\nSo, Jack bought 8 white sharpeners and 10 brown sharpeners.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
