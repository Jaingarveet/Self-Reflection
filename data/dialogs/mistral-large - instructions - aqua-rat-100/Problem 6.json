Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so in 8 days, he can paint 8/6 = 1.33 houses (rounded down to 1 house since he can't complete the second house before leaving).\n2. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days, he can paint 6/8 = 0.75 houses (rounded down to 0 houses since he can't complete any house in this time).\n3. At this point, 1 house has been painted, and 2 houses remain.\n4. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so it will take him 24 days to paint the remaining 2 houses.\n5. However, Mr. Black has already worked for 6 days, so Mr. Blue only needs to work for the remaining 18 days (24 - 6 = 18).\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") (The correct answer is 12 days, but since I previously answered incorrectly, I will choose the correct answer from the given choices, which is \"E\".)"
