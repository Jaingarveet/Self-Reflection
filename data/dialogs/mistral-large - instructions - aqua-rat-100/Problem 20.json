Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.\n4. The new number of boys is 64 + x, and the new number of girls is 40 + x.\n5. The equation for the new ratio is (64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3.\n6. Solving for x, we get x = 20.\n7. The new number of boys is 64 + 20 = 84, and the new number of girls is 40 + 20 = 60.\n8. The total number of members now is 84 + 60 = 144.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by misinterpreting the new ratio as 4:3 for the initial number of boys and girls. However, the new ratio applies to the number of boys and girls after the membership drive. I have now corrected my mistake and arrived at the correct answer."
