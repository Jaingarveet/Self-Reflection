Then the five consecutive odd numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, and n+8.\nThe sum of these numbers is 5n+20, which can be simplified to 5(n+4).\nSince the sum is divisible by 10, we know that n+4 must be divisible by 2.\nTherefore, n must be an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.\nLet's check each answer choice to see which one satisfies this condition:\nA: 47 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.\nB: 91 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.\nC: 41 is an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4. Let's check if it works.\nIf n=41, then the five consecutive odd numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, and 49.\nTheir sum is 225, which is 22 squared.\nTherefore, C is a possible answer.\nD: 67 is not an odd number that is 2 less than a multiple of 4.\nE: 44 is not an odd number.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
