I incorrectly cancelled out the $2$s in the numerator and denominator, leading me to conclude that $\\frac{a}{b} = 1$. The correct solution is to recognize that $\\frac{a}{b} = 2$ means that $a = 2b$, and therefore, $\\frac{4b}{a} = \\frac{4b}{2b} = 2$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Cancellation error\n* Misapplication of rules\n* Lack of attention to detail\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Recognize that $\\frac{a}{b} = 2$ means that $a = 2b$.\n2. Use this relationship to find $\\frac{4b}{a} = \\frac{4b}{2b} = 2$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the given information in the problem.\n2. Use the given information to find the value of the expression.\n3. Simplify the expression, if possible.\n4. Check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.\n* Use the given information to find the solution, rather than relying on general rules or formulas.\n* Simplify your answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.\n\nReflection:\nI will be more careful in my reasoning and pay closer attention to the given information in the problem. I will also make sure to simplify my answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct. In the future, I will double-check my answer to prevent similar errors.\n"

I lacked attention to detail and did not simplify my answer. This time, I carefully read the problem, used the given information to find the solution, and simplified my answer.
