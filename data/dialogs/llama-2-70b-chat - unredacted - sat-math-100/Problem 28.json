Rearrange the equation to isolate x.\n2. Expand the right-hand side of the equation.\n3. Factor the left-hand side of the equation.\n4. Solve for x in each possible case.\n5. List all values of x that satisfy the equation.\nAdvice:\n - Always check your work by plugging in the solutions to the original equation.\n - Be thorough in your analysis and consider all possible cases.\n - Don't overlook simple solutions.\n - Use a systematic approach to solve equations.\n - Factoring is not always the best approach; consider other methods, such as using equations' properties or graphing.\n"

I only considered two cases, whereas there were three possible cases. I made a factoring error and overlooked solutions. I should have expanded the right-hand side of the equation and factored the left-hand side to find all possible solutions. This time, I used a systematic approach to solve the equation and considered all possible cases, which led me to the correct answer. I also plugged in the solutions to the original equation to check my work."
