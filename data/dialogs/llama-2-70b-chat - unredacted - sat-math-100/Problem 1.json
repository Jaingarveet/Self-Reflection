Which of the following gives $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $v=h+k-16 t$\n  B: $v=\\frac{h-k+16}{t}$\n  C: $v=\\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$\n  D: $v=\\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the equation and wrote the wrong expression for v.\nThe correct expression for v is v = (h - k) / t + 16t, not v = (h + k) / t - 16t.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Equation manipulation error\n- Algebraic error\nSolution:\nWe are given the equation:\n\nh = -16t^2 + vt + k\n\nWe can isolate v by rearranging the equation:\n\nv = (h - k) / t + 16t\n\nInstructions:\n1. Rearrange the equation to isolate v.\n2. Simplify the expression for v.\n3. Check your work by plugging in values for h, t, and k.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the equation carefully and understand the variables.\n- Always use the correct formula or equation to solve the problem.\n- Always check your work to ensure accuracy.\n- Don't assume the correct answer without verifying it through calculation.\n- Practice solving similar problems to build your math skills.\n"
