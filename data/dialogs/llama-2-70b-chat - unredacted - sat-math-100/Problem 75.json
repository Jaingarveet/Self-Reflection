The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\$ 90$\n  B: $\\$ 120$\n  C: $\\$ 133$\n  D: $\\$ 155$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation.\nI misunderstood the equation and solved for $P$ as $133$, but the correct solution is $P = 120$.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Equation solving error\n- Algebraic error\nSolution:\nWe are given the supply function $S(P) = \\frac{1}{2} P + 40$ and the demand function $D(P) = 220 - P$.\nTo find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we set the two functions equal to each other:\n$S(P) = D(P)$\n$\\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$\n$P = 120$\nInstructions:\n1. Set the supply function equal to the demand function.\n2. Solve for $P$.\n3. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Make sure to carry out all calculations carefully and accurately, and avoid simple algebraic errors.\n"
