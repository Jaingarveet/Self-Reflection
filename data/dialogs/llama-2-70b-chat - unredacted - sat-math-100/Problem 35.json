I incorrectly solved for x = 3, when in fact, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.\nI misunderstood the equation and solved for the wrong value of x.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Solution error\n- Equation solving error\n\nSolution:\nLet's start by squaring both sides of the equation:\n$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:\n$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$\nMoving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:\n$$3x = 9$$\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n$$x = 3$$\nHowever, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.\nLet's try another approach. We can factor the left-hand side of the equation:\n$$4x = \\sqrt{4x}$$\nWe know that $\\sqrt{4x} = 2x$, so we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$4x = 2x$$\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n$$2x = x$$\nSubtracting x from both sides, we get:\n$$x = 0$$\nSo, the only value of x that satisfies the given equation is x = 0.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Start by squaring both sides of the equation.\n2. Expand the right-hand side of the equation.\n3. Move all terms to the left-hand side and simplify.\n4. Check your solution to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n5. If your solution does not satisfy the equation, try another approach.\n6. Factor the left-hand side of the equation.\n7. Substitute the factor into the equation.\n8. Solve for x.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that equations can be solved in different ways, so be open to alternative solutions.\n"

However, this approach leads to a calculation error, as x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.\n\nAlternatively, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation, substituting √4x = 2x, and solve for x. This approach yields x = 0 as the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: I and II, as both approaches lead to different values of x that satisfy the equation.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the equation and solved for the wrong value of x. I learned that it is essential to double-check calculations and consider alternative solutions to ensure accuracy. By reflecting on my mistake, I realized the importance of breaking down complex problems into simpler steps and being explicit in my reasoning. This helped me arrive at the correct answer and avoid similar errors in the future."
