If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 15\n  C: 20\n  D: 22\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and wrote the equation $0.99LW = 0.88A$ instead of $0.99LW = 0.88L^2$. This led to a series of incorrect calculations, and I arrived at the incorrect answer $p = 0.88$.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the question\n* Incorrect equation\n* Incorrect calculations\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Let's call the original length and width of the rectangle $L$ and $W$, respectively.\n3. The area of the original rectangle is $A = LW$.\n4. After the alterations, the length is $L + 10\\%$ of $L$ = $1.1L$ and the width is $W - p\\%$ of $W$ = $0.9W$.\n5. The area of the modified rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(0.9W) = 0.99LW$.\n6. The question states that the area of the modified rectangle is 12% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$0.99LW = 0.88L^2$\n\n7. Now, we can solve for $p$. We know that $L$ and $W$ are positive, so we can divide both sides of the equation by $LW$ to get:\n\n$0.99 = 0.88\\frac{L^2}{LW}$\n\n$1 = 0.88\\frac{L}{W}$\n\n$W = 0.88L$\n\n8. Now, we can substitute this expression for $W$ into the equation for the area of the modified rectangle:\n\n$A' = (1.1L)(0.88L) = 0.99L^2$\n\n9. We know that the area of the modified rectangle is 12% less than the area of the original rectangle, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$\n\n10. Now, we can solve for $L$:\n\n$L = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.88A}{0.99}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{1.1}}$\n\n11. Now, we can substitute this expression for $L$ into the equation for $W$:\n\n$W = 0.88L = 0.88\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{1.1}}$\n\n12. Now, we can find $p$ by substituting $W$ into the equation for $A'$:\n\n$A' = (1.1L)(0.88\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{1.1}}) = 0.99L^2$\n\n$0.99L^2 = 0.88A$\n\n$L^2 = \\frac{0.88A}{0.99}$\n\n$L = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$\n\n$W = 0.88L = 0.88\\sqrt{\\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}$\n\n$p = \\frac{W}{L} = \\frac{0.88\\sqrt{\\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.88A}{0.99}}} = 0.88$\n\nTherefore, the value of $p$ is $0.88$, which corresponds to choice $B$.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
