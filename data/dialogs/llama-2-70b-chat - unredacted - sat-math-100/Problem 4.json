Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 0\n  B: 4\n  C: 8\n  D: 16\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.\nI mistakenly substituted (0, k) into the equation of the line instead of (k, 0).\nThis led me to conclude that k = 32, which is incorrect.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Substitution error\n- Equation error\n\nSolution:\nThe line passes through the origin, so one of the points must be (k, 0).\nSubstituting (k, 0) into the equation of the line given by the two points, we get:\nk = 8\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the point that passes through the origin.\n2. Substitute the coordinates of the point that passes through the origin into the equation of the line.\n3. Solve for k.\n4. Check your answer by plugging k into the equation of the line.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Make sure to substitute the correct coordinates into the equation of the line.\n"
