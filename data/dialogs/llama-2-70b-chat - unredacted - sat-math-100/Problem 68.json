The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution must he use?\nChoices:\n  A: 5\n  B: 25\n  C: 50\n  D: 100\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.\nI isolated x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, but then I made a mistake in simplifying the equation.\nI incorrectly substituted y = 100 into the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Substitution error\n- Simplification error\n\nSolution:\nWe can start by isolating x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, which results in 0.10x = 0.18(x+y) - 0.20y.\nNext, we can substitute y = 100, as given in the question, and simplify to get 0.10x = 18 - 200.\nSolving for x, we get x = 25.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Isolate x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation.\n3. Substitute y = 100 into the equation.\n4. Simplify the equation to solve for x.\n5. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always work step-by-step through your calculations.\n- Always check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n- Be careful when substituting values into equations.\n- Be careful when simplifying equations.\n- Double-check your final answer to ensure it is reasonable.\n"
