I will use my previous reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* I initially chose answer A because I incorrectly assumed that the shipping charge increased by a constant amount for each additional pound of merchandise.\n* However, upon closer examination of the table, I realized that the shipping charge increases by a **non-constant** amount for each additional pound.\n* This means that the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is not linear, and therefore, the correct answer cannot be A or B.\n* Instead, I should look for an answer that represents a **non-linear** relationship.\n* Answer C represents a linear relationship, so it can be eliminated.\n* Answer D represents a non-linear relationship, and it correctly reflects the increasing rate of change in the shipping charge as the weight of the merchandise increases.\n**Answer:**\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
