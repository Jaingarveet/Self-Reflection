However, I realized that this term represents the acceleration due to gravity, which is always negative for objects thrown upwards.\n* The correct answer should isolate $v$ and include the terms $h$, $t$, and $k$.\n* Answer B satisfies these conditions and correctly represents the initial velocity.\n**Answer:**\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
