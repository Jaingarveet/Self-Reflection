Which of the following functions represents the helicopter's altitude above the ground $y$, in feet, $t$ seconds after the helicopter begins to gain altitude?\nChoices:\n  A: $y=40+21$\n  B: $y=40+21 t$\n  C: $y=40-21 t$\n  D: $y=40 t+21$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the slope and y-intercept of the linear equation that represents the helicopter's altitude. \nI correctly identified the rate of change (21 feet per second) as the slope, but I mistakenly used the initial altitude (40 feet) as the y-intercept instead of the initial time (0 seconds).\n"
