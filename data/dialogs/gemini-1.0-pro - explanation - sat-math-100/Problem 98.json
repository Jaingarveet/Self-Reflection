I will try my best to answer this question correctly this time.\nTo solve the system of equations, we can use the elimination method. We can eliminate $x$ by adding the equations together when the $x$ coefficients have opposite signs.\nMultiplying the second equation by 3, we get:\n$$\\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\\\-3x+6 y=-57\\end{array}$$\nAdding the equations together, we get:\n$$10y=-80$$\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n$$y=-8$$\nSubstituting $y=-8$ into the first equation, we get:\n$$3x+4(-8)=-23$$\n$$3x-32=-23$$\n$$3x=9$$\n$$x=3$$\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (3, -8)$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
