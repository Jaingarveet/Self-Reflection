I did not consider the fact that the line passes through the origin, which means that both $x$ and $y$ must be equal to zero at some point. \nTo find the value of $k$, we can use the slope formula:\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\nSince the line passes through the origin, we have $y_1 = 0$ and $x_1 = 0$. We also know that $y_2 = 32$ and $x_2 = k$. Substituting these values into the slope formula, we get:\n$$m = \\frac{32 - 0}{k - 0} = \\frac{32}{k}$$\nSince the line passes through the origin, the slope must be equal to zero. Therefore, we have:\n$$\\frac{32}{k} = 0$$\nThis equation has no solution, which means that there is no value of $k$ that satisfies the given conditions.\nTherefore, the answer is **None of the Above**.\nI have learned from my mistake and will be more careful in the future."
