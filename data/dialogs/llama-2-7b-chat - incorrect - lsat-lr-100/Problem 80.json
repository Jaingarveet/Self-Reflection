The document inadvertently sent to the journalist does not provide any evidence that Bruch Industries is a member of the trade group, and the representative's confirmation that every company listed in the document is a member of the trade group does not necessarily mean that Bruch Industries is a member. Therefore, the journalist's conclusion that Bruch Industries is not a member of the trade group is reasonable."
