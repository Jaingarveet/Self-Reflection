This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.\n  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.\n  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.\n  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.\n  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the information provided. The correct answer is (C) Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.\n\nExplanation:\nThe statement \"Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals\" implies that the current habitat is already at its maximum capacity. If the population of Florida panthers is to reach 250, they will need a larger habitat to accommodate more individuals. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer. Thank you for providing the opportunity for self-reflection and improvement."
