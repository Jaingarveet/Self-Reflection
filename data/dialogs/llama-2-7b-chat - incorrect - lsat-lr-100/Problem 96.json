My solution was:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (B): The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic.\n\nExplanation:\nThe phenomenon described in the passage suggests that the opposite of what I initially thought. I mistakenly assumed that the highways with the highest rate of fatal accidents would have the highest volume of traffic, which is the opposite of what the passage states. The passage states that the highways that carry the most traffic tend to have the lowest rate of fatal accidents. This means that the volume of traffic is inversely related to the rate of fatal accidents, which supports the correct answer (B).\n\nTherefore, I will change my answer to (B): The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic."
