To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?\nChoices:\n  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.\n  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.\n  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.\n  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.\n  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, the Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that the development of wetlands in industrialized nations has endangered many species and that regulation is necessary to protect wildlife.\n\nIf we accept the principle that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, then we can see why the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is more compelling. Future generations will inherit the consequences of our actions today, and it is our responsibility to ensure that their inheritance includes a healthy and thriving environment. Allowing development to continue unchecked could lead to the loss of irreplaceable wetland habitats and the extinction of species that are essential to the ecosystem.\n\nIn contrast, the Figorian Development Commission's position prioritizes economic growth over environmental protection, which could lead to further degradation of the environment and the loss of biodiversity. While development may be necessary for growth, it is not more important than preserving the natural resources that are essential to the well-being of future generations.\n\nTherefore, if we accept the principle that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, then we must support the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position and regulate development in Figoria to protect the wetlands and the species that inhabit them."
