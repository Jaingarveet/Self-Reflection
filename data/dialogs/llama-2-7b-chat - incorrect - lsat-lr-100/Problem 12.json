Today, our choice is clear: either we adopt my plan to build a new expressway, or we do nothing. Doing nothing is not a viable option because our existing system of roads would be in gridlock within ten years given even a conservative estimate of future traffic levels. City council should therefore adopt my plan.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms?\nChoices:\n  A: It bases a projection only on conservative estimates rather than considering a wider range of estimates.\n  B: It takes for granted that the options it considers are mutually exclusive.\n  C: It fails to consider the possibility that the rate of increase in traffic will start to diminish after ten years.\n  D: It fails to address the issue of the cost of traffic gridlock to the city's economy.\n  E: It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, there may be other alternatives that the mayor has not considered, such as improving public transportation, promoting alternative modes of transportation like cycling or walking, or implementing traffic management strategies like traffic lights or rerouting traffic. By limiting the options to only two, the mayor's argument fails to address the possibility of other viable solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options."
