Then, I simplified the equation and rearranged the terms to get $24x^2+(25+8a)x+(53-47a)=0$. \nNext, I used the quadratic formula to solve for $x$: $x=\\frac{-(25+8a) \\pm \\sqrt{(25+8a)^2-4(24)(53-47a)}}{2(24)}$. \nHowever, I realized that I made a mistake in my simplification of the equation. The correct equation should be $24x^2+(25+53-8a)x-47=0$. \nUsing the quadratic formula with this corrected equation, I get $x=\\frac{-(25+53-8a) \\pm \\sqrt{(25+53-8a)^2-4(24)(-47)}}{2(24)}$. \nSimplifying this expression, I get $x=\\frac{a-2}{3}$ or $x=-\\frac{47}{24a-4}$. \nSince the equation is true for all values of $x \\neq \\frac{2}{a}$, the second solution is extraneous and can be ignored. \nTherefore, $\\frac{a-2}{3} \\neq \\frac{2}{a}$, which simplifies to $a^2-8a+12 \\neq 0$. Factoring this quadratic, I get $(a-2)(a-6) \\neq 0$. \nThus, the possible values of $a$ are $a \\neq 2$ and $a \\neq 6$. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
