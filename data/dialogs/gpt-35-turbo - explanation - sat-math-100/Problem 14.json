        "content": "[REDACTED] \nAs there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. \nTo find the slope, we can use any two points from the table. Let's use the first and second rows: \n$\\text{slope}=\\frac{\\text{change in y}}{\\text{change in x}}=\\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-1$ \nNow we can use the slope and one of the points to find the y-intercept: \n$0=(-1)(0)+b \\Rightarrow b=0$ \nTherefore, the equation of the line is $y=-x+0$ or simply $y=-x$. \nTo check which equation represents this relationship, we can rearrange each equation into slope-intercept form and see which one has a slope of $-1$ and a y-intercept of $0$. \nA: $x+2y=a \\Rightarrow 2y=-x+a \\Rightarrow y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{a}{2}$ \nB: $x+2y=5a \\Rightarrow 2y=-x+5a \\Rightarrow y=-\\frac{1}{2}x+\\frac{5a}{2}$ \nC: $2x-y=-5a \\Rightarrow -y=-2x-5a \\Rightarrow y=2x+5a$ \nD: $2x-y=7a \\Rightarrow -y=-2x+7a \\Rightarrow y=2x-7a$ \nThe only equation that matches our slope and y-intercept is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2x-y=-5a}$."
