Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 0\n  B: 4\n  C: 8\n  D: 16\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly identified that the equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.\nHowever, I made an error in substituting $x=[REDACTED]$ and $y=[REDACTED]$ in the equation of the line.\nWhen $x=[REDACTED]$ and $y=[REDACTED]$, the equation becomes $-k=\\frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $k^2-[REDACTED]k+[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]$.\nFactoring this equation gives $(k-[REDACTED])(k-[REDACTED])=[REDACTED]$, so $k=[REDACTED]$ is a repeated root.\nHowever, the question asks for which of the following could be the value of $k$, so we need to check the other answer choices.\nSubstituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives a line with a slope of $\\frac{32}{-2}=-[REDACTED]$, which does not pass through the origin.\nSubstituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives a line with a slope of $\\frac{2[REDACTED]}{6}=[REDACTED]$, which does pass through the origin.\nSubstituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives a line with a slope of $\\frac{[REDACTED]}{-1[REDACTED]}$, which does not pass through the origin.\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }[REDACTED]}$.\n"
