Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

While I correctly determined that \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter\", I failed to use that knowledge along with the sentence structures to infer the meaning of \"Doximayo\".\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Failure to synthesize information \n- Missed logical deduction\n- Incomplete problem solving\nSolution:\nGiven:\n1. \"Alingoits Doximayo Makasey\" means \"kidnapping student (host) hostage\"\n2. \"Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs\" means \"hostage holding (see) reporter\" \n3. \"Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits\" means \"kidnapping reporters away\"\nFrom sentences 2 and 3, we can deduce that \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter(s)\".\nNow, looking at sentence 1, we see that \"Doximayo\" is in the same position as \"student\" in the translation. \nSince we know \"Mugbudengs\" means \"reporter(s)\", by process of elimination, \"Doximayo\" must mean \"student\".\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: \"Doximayo\" means \"student\".\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and analyze each piece of given information.\n2. Look for words that appear in multiple sentences and use their positions to deduce their meanings.\n3. Once you have determined the meaning of a word, use that knowledge to help deduce other word meanings.\n4. Use process of elimination based on sentence structure to determine the meanings of remaining words.\n5. Synthesize all of the information to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n6. Choose the answer choice that matches your deduction.\nAdvice:\n- Always fully utilize all of the given information when solving logic problems.\n- Look for patterns and similarities in the structure of the information provided.\n- If you can definitively determine the meaning of some elements, use that knowledge to deduce the meaning of other elements.\n- Employ process of elimination to systematically rule out incorrect possibilities.\n- Synthesize the information and patterns you have identified to reach a logical conclusion.\n- If you get stuck, methodically go through the problem-solving steps one-by-one."
