At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\n\nXiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen's view that the flickering of Comet 1996D3 must be unusual because it was observed far from the sun, which is not typical. Xiao Wang points out that the reason people don't normally observe distant comets flickering is not necessarily because it's unusual, but rather because they aren't continuously and carefully tracking those comets.\nIn other words, Xiao Wang disagrees with Xiao Chen's conclusion that the flickering must be unusual, and provides an alternative explanation - that it's due to the continuous, careful observations, not the comet's unusual behavior.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nUpon further reflection, I realize I misinterpreted the question and Xiao Wang's rebuttal. The question asks about the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen, not the content of the rebuttal itself.\nXiao Wang did not directly disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or provide an alternative explanation. Rather, Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument lacked persuasion and jumped to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Just because people don't normally observe distant comets flickering doesn't necessarily mean this instance is unusual - it could simply be due to lack of continuous, careful observation in the past.\nError Keywords:\n - Question misinterpretation \n - Focusing on argument content vs. argument method\n - Insufficient question analysis\nSolution:\nXiao Chen argues that since the flickering of Comet 1996D3 far from the sun has not been observed before, it must be an unusual occurrence. \nXiao Wang counters by saying that people don't normally observe distant comets, and this flickering was only discovered through continuous, careful tracking. \nXiao Wang is pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument jumps to a conclusion and lacks persuasion. Just because something hasn't been observed before doesn't mean it's necessarily unusual - it could simply be due to lack of sufficient observation in the past.\nTherefore, Xiao Wang's refutation focuses on exposing the weakness and lack of persuasion in Xiao Chen's line of reasoning, not on providing an alternative explanation.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully, focusing on exactly what is being asked.\n2. Identify the key claims and conclusions made by each person. \n3. Analyze how the second person is responding to the first person's argument.\n4. Determine if the response is addressing the content of the argument or the method/logic of the argument.\n5. Select the answer choice that best describes the method of refutation used, not the content of the refutation.\nAdvice:\n - Always read questions carefully and make sure you understand exactly what is being asked before attempting to answer.\n - In logic questions about arguments, differentiate between the content of an argument and the method/structure of an argument.\n - When someone refutes an argument, identify if they are attacking the conclusion, the premises, or the overall logic and persuasiveness of the argument.\n - Eliminate answer choices that do not fit the refutation method used, even if they seem somewhat relevant to the argument's content.\n - If you find yourself focusing too much on the details of the arguments, take a step back and look at the big picture of how the arguments interact."
