Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Since 1993, sand and dust storms have frequently occurred in the Inner Mongolia region of our country, causing major economic losses.Some people think that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought.They are natural disasters, so they are inevitable.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, can the above opinions be questioned, except?\nChoices:\n  A: In the 1950s, grass in Xilin Gol grassland in Inner Mongolia was as tall as a horse's belly, and now grass can't even cover mice.\n  B: Opposite the degraded grasslands of Hulunbeier and Xilinguole in Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Mongolian grassland are about 1 meter high.\n  C: On the almost uninhabited border line of 10 kilometers wide between China and Mongolia, grass still maintains the height of the 1950s.\n  D: The increase in dust storms is mainly due to human factors such as overloaded grazing and predatory management of grasslands.\n\nTo determine if the given opinion can be questioned, let's analyze each choice:\nA: This suggests that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia, which could be due to factors other than just climate drought. This choice questions the opinion.\nB: The fact that grasslands in Mongolia are still thriving while those in Inner Mongolia have degraded suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible. This choice questions the opinion.\nC: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.\nD: This choice directly states that human factors, such as overgrazing and poor grassland management, are the main causes of increased dust storms. It supports the idea that the given opinion can be questioned.\nTherefore, all the choices suggest that the opinion can be questioned, as they point to human activities being the primary cause of grassland degradation and dust storms, rather than just climate drought.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly interpreted choice A as questioning the given opinion, when in fact it supports it. Choice A indicates that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia, which is consistent with the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation due to climate drought. My error was in misinterpreting the implications of the choice with respect to the given opinion.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of choice\n - Incorrect inference\n - Faulty reasoning\n - Misunderstanding of relationship between choice and opinion\nSolution:\nLet's re-evaluate each choice to determine if it allows the given opinion to be questioned:\nA: The fact that grass in Xilin Gol grassland has significantly decreased in height over time supports the idea that grassland degradation has occurred, which is consistent with the opinion. This choice does not question the opinion.\nB: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia and the thriving grasslands in Mongolia suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible for the degradation. This choice questions the opinion.\nC: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.\nD: This choice directly states that human factors are the main causes of increased dust storms, questioning the opinion that they are inevitable natural disasters caused by climate drought.\nTherefore, choices B, C, and D allow the given opinion to be questioned, while choice A supports the opinion.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the given opinion carefully and identify its key points.\n2. Analyze each choice individually to determine its relationship to the opinion.\n3. Consider whether each choice supports, questions, or is neutral to the opinion.\n4. Identify the choice that does not allow the opinion to be questioned, i.e., the choice that supports the opinion.\n5. Double-check your reasoning for each choice to ensure accuracy.\n6. Select the choice that is the exception, i.e., the one that does not question the opinion.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the given opinion and choices carefully to understand their implications.\n - Consider the relationship between each choice and the opinion individually.\n - Look for choices that provide evidence or reasoning that contradicts the opinion.\n - Be cautious of choices that may initially seem to question the opinion but actually support it upon closer examination.\n - Double-check your reasoning for each choice to avoid misinterpretations."
