Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Be mindful of all the information provided in the prompt, including numerical details and subtle hints.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n- When multiple scenarios are possible, consider their relative likelihood based on the given information.\n- If quantitative information is available, use calculations to determine probabilities and support your reasoning.\n- Choose the answer that aligns with the most likely scenario, considering all the constraints and information provided.\n"

This leaves Udall for Zone 3.\n- **Zone 2:** If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Udall must be in Zone 2 (due to condition 2). This leaves Parra for Zone 3.\n- **Zone 3:** In either case, Zone 3 has two representatives (Parra or Udall, and Stuckey).\nNow, let's analyze the answer choices:\n**A: Kim works in Zone 2:** This is possible. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is in Zone 2, leaving Kim and Udall for Zone 3.\n**B: Mahr works in Zone 1:** This is not possible. Mahr and Stuckey are in the same zone, and Stuckey cannot be in Zone 1 (due to conditions 1 and 2).\n**C: Parra works in Zone 3:** This is possible. If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is in Zone 3.\n**D: Stuckey works in Zone 2:** This is not possible. Stuckey and Mahr are in the same zone, and Mahr cannot be in Zone 2 (due to conditions 1 and 2).\n**E: Tiao works in Zone 1:** This is possible. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is in Zone 2, leaving Kim and Udall for Zone 3.\nTherefore, the possible scenarios are A, C, and E. However, considering the information about Zone 3 having more representatives than Zone 2, scenario A (Kim in Zone 2) is more likely.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
