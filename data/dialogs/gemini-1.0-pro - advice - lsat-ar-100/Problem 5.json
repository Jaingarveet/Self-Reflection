I only considered the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I did not consider the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the conditions. I need to start by placing the books on the shelves according to the conditions. I know that I is placed on the middle shelf. I also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. This means that K must be placed on either the top shelf or the middle shelf. I also know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means that O must be placed on either the top shelf or the middle shelf.\nI can now start to place the books on the shelves. I will start by placing the books that I know must be placed on the top shelf or the middle shelf. I will place K on the top shelf and O on the middle shelf. This leaves F, G, H, L, and M to be placed on the bottom shelf.\nI know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. This means that at least three books must be placed on the bottom shelf. I can now place F, G, H, L, and M on the bottom shelf.\nI have now placed all of the books on the shelves according to the conditions. I can now answer the question.\nThe question asks which one of the following must be true.\nA: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on. This is not true. O is placed on the middle shelf and M is placed on the bottom shelf.\nB: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on. This is true. K is placed on the top shelf and G is placed on the bottom shelf.\nC: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on. This is not true. I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the bottom shelf.\nD: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on. This is not true. G is placed on the bottom shelf and O is placed on the middle shelf.\nE: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on. This is not true. F is placed on the bottom shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
