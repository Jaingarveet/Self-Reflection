The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Be meticulous in interpreting and applying constraints.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and permutations.\n - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\n - Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n - When multiple valid solutions exist, identify and present all of them.\n"

Pharmacy and restaurant placement:\n   - The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other.\n   - This leaves five spaces for the remaining businesses.\n2. Restaurant separation:\n   - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\n   - This means they cannot be adjacent.\n3. Pharmacy adjacency:\n   - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n   - This leaves three possible positions for the pharmacy: space 1, space 2, or space 7.\n4. Toy store and veterinarian:\n   - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n   - This constraint applies regardless of the pharmacy's position.\nPossible scenarios:\nScenario 1: Pharmacy in space 1 or 7:\n   - If the pharmacy is in space 1, the veterinarian cannot be in space 2 or 7.\n   - If the pharmacy is in space 7, the veterinarian cannot be in space 1 or 6.\n   - In both cases, the two restaurants can be placed in spaces 3 and 5 or 4 and 6.\n   - This scenario allows for two valid solutions:\n     - Pharmacy, Optometrist, Restaurant, Veterinarian, Toy Store, Restaurant, Shoe Store\n     - Pharmacy, Restaurant, Veterinarian, Toy Store, Restaurant, Optometrist, Shoe Store\nScenario 2: Pharmacy in space 2:\n   - The veterinarian cannot be in space 1 or 3.\n   - The two restaurants can be placed in spaces 4 and 6 or 5 and 7.\n   - This scenario allows for one valid solution:\n     - Pharmacy, Veterinarian, Optometrist, Restaurant, Toy Store, Restaurant, Shoe Store\nTherefore, there are three possible valid solutions:\nA: Pharmacy, Optometrist, Restaurant, Veterinarian, Toy Store, Restaurant, Shoe Store\nB: Pharmacy, Restaurant, Veterinarian, Toy Store, Restaurant, Optometrist, Shoe Store\nC: Pharmacy, Veterinarian, Optometrist, Restaurant, Toy Store, Restaurant, Shoe Store\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
