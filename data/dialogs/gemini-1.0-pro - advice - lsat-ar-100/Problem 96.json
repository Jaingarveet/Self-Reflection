However, I overlooked the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.\n**Corrected Reasoning:**\n1. **Himalayans are not featured on day 2.** This eliminates options A and B, as Manx and Siamese cannot be featured on consecutive days.\n2. **Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.** This eliminates option E, as Greyhounds cannot be featured on consecutive days.\n3. **Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.** This eliminates option C, as Himalayans are featured on day 6.\n4. **Therefore, the only remaining option is D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.** This satisfies all the conditions:\n    - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.\n    - Himalayans are not featured on day 1.\n    - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 or on any day that features Himalayans.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")**"
