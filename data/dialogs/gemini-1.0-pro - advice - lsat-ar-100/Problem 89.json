This is possible, as the second batch is made on Thursday and the first batch could be made on any other day.\n    - Option B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. This is also possible, as the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter, which could be Wednesday or Thursday.\n    - Option D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. This is possible, as the second batch is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal, which could be Thursday or Friday.\n4. **Conclusion:** Both options A, B, and D are possible scenarios given the provided conditions.\n**Action:** \nSince multiple options are possible, it is not possible to definitively choose one. \nTherefore, the answer is: \n\"Action: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\" \n"
