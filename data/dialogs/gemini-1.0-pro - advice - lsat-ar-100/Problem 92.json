I assumed that since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, then Quinn must work in Zone 1. However, this is not necessarily true. It is possible that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2 or Zone 3.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to carefully consider all of the conditions that are given and then use a process of elimination to determine which of the answer choices is the only one that cannot be true.\nHere is my step-by-step solution:\n1. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they cannot work in Zone 1. This is because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, they cannot work in Zone 2. This is because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Since there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.\n4. Since Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall are the only sales representatives, and since Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 2, then Kim, Mahr, and Tiao must work in Zone 1.\n5. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and since Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1.\n6. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and since Parra cannot work in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 2.\n7. Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and since Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.\n8. Since Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, and since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.\n9. Since there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and since Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3, then Kim and Mahr must also work in Zone 3.\nTherefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
