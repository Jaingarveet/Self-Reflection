This means that the organizer can select either four French works or three French works.\nIf the organizer selects four French works, then they can select either one Russian novel or two Russian novels. However, if they select two Russian novels, then they would not be able to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, the organizer must select one Russian novel if they select four French works.\nIf the organizer selects three French works, then they can select either two Russian novels or three Russian novels. However, if they select three Russian novels, then they would not be able to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, the organizer must select two Russian novels if they select three French works.\nNow, let's consider the requirement that at least three but no more than four novels are selected. If the organizer selects four French works, then they can only select one novel, which would not satisfy the requirement. Therefore, the organizer must select three French works.\nIf the organizer selects three French works, then they can select either two Russian novels or three Russian novels. However, if they select three Russian novels, then they would not be able to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, the organizer must select two Russian novels if they select three French works.\nFinally, let's consider the requirement that if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. Since the organizer must select at least five works, they cannot select both French plays. Therefore, the Russian play can be selected.\nIn conclusion, the organizer must select at least one French novel, two Russian novels, and one Russian play.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
