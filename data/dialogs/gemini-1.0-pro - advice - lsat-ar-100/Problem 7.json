This led me to choose C, which states that Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Reasoning:** \n1. **Jackson on Monday:** This leaves two slots for Tuesday and one for Wednesday.\n2. **Iturbe on Wednesday:** This fills the Wednesday slot.\n3. **Franco and Garcia cannot be together:** This means they must be split between Tuesday and Wednesday.\n4. **Two witnesses on Tuesday:** This leaves only one slot for Franco or Garcia on Tuesday.\n5. **Hong not on Monday:** This means Hong must be on either Tuesday or Wednesday.\nSince Franco and Garcia cannot be together and there are only two slots on Tuesday, one of them must be on Wednesday. This eliminates options A, C, and E. \nNow, we are left with options B and D. \n* **Option B:** Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This satisfies all conditions: Jackson on Monday, Iturbe on Wednesday, Franco and Garcia split between Tuesday and Wednesday, two witnesses on Tuesday, and Hong not on Monday.\n* **Option D:** Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong. This violates the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot be together.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n## Action: Answer(\"B\") \n"
