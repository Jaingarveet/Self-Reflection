Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

I only considered the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. I did not consider the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the rules. I need to start by assigning Robertson a parking space. Since Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, I can assign him any of these four spaces.\nOnce I have assigned Robertson a parking space, I can then assign the other employees parking spaces. I need to make sure that I follow the rules that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nI can start by assigning Togowa a parking space. Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, I cannot assign Togowa parking space #6. I can assign Togowa parking space #1, #2, #3, #4, or #5.\nOnce I have assigned Togowa a parking space, I can then assign Souza a parking space. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, I cannot assign Souza parking space #6 or #5. I can assign Souza parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nOnce I have assigned Souza a parking space, I can then assign Young a parking space. Since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, I cannot assign Young parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. I can only assign Young parking space #5 or #6.\nOnce I have assigned Young a parking space, I can then assign Xu a parking space. Since Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, I cannot assign Xu parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. I can only assign Xu parking space #5 or #6.\nOnce I have assigned Xu a parking space, I can then assign Vaughn a parking space. Since Vaughn has no restrictions on his parking space, I can assign him any of the remaining parking spaces.\nI have now assigned all six employees parking spaces. I have followed all of the rules. I have also limited the assignment of a parking space to one of only two possible spaces for two of the six employees: Togowa and Young.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
