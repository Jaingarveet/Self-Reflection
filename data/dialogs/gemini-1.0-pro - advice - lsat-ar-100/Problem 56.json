Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

I focused on the information about Zone 1 and Zone 3, but I overlooked the information about Zone 2.\n**Corrected Approach:**\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all the conditions and use a systematic approach to eliminate the incorrect options.\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n1. **Zone 1:** Since more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.\n2. **Zone 2:** Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there can be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.\n3. **Zone 3:** Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.\n4. **Parra and Quinn:** Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, they cannot both be in Zone 1 (as that would exceed the maximum capacity of Zone 1). Therefore, one of them must be in Zone 2 and the other in Zone 3.\n5. **Stuckey and Udall:** Similarly, since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they cannot both be in Zone 3 (as that would exceed the maximum capacity of Zone 3). Therefore, one of them must be in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 2.\n6. **Tiao:** Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra cannot be in Zone 1 due to the condition above, Tiao must be in Zone 1.\n7. **Udall:** Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall must be in Zone 2.\n**Eliminating Incorrect Options:**\n* **A: Kim works in Zone 2:** This is possible, as Kim can be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.\n* **B: Mahr works in Zone 2:** This is not possible, as Mahr must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.\n* **C: Parra works in Zone 3:** This is not possible, as Parra must be in Zone 2.\n* **D: Tiao works in Zone 1:** This is true, as we established in step 6.\n* **E: Udall works in Zone 3:** This is not possible, as Udall must be in Zone 2.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only option that could be true is **D: Tiao works in Zone 1**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
