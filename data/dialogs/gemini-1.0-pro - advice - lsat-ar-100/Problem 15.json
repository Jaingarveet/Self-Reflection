The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Be thorough in your analysis and consider all possibilities.\n - Do not jump to conclusions without exploring all options.\n - Pay close attention to the given constraints and ensure that your solution satisfies them.\n - Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n - Be systematic in your approach and avoid making careless mistakes.\n"

        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I focused on the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian and overlooked the other constraints.\n**Correct Answer:** E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\n**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**\n1. **Pharmacy Location:** The pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Let's assume it's at the left end (space 1).\n2. **Restaurant Locations:** One restaurant must be at the other end (space 7). The other restaurant cannot be next to it, so it must be in either space 2 or space 6.\n3. **Optometrist and Veterinarian Locations:** The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy is at the left end, the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2.\n4. **Toy Store Location:** The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, who is in space 2. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in spaces 1, 2, or 3.\n5. **Shoe Store Location:** The shoe store is in space 4.\n6. **Constraint Satisfaction:** With the current arrangement, all constraints are satisfied:\n    - Pharmacy is at one end (space 1).\n    - Restaurants are at opposite ends (spaces 1 and 7).\n    - Restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses (spaces 3, 4, and 5).\n    - Pharmacy is next to the veterinarian (space 2).\n    - Toy store is not next to the veterinarian.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is that the shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\") \n"
