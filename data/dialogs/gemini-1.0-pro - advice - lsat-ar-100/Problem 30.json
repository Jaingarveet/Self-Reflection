Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Thought:**\n* **First solo:** We don't know who performs the first solo, so let's call it X.\n* **Second solo:** If X also performs the second solo, then X cannot perform the fifth solo (given condition).\n* **Third solo:** This is a traditional piece.\n* **Fourth solo:** Either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.\n* **Fifth solo:** X cannot perform the fifth solo (as mentioned above).\n**Analysis:**\n* **Option A:** Zara performs the first solo - This is possible, but not necessarily true.\n* **Option B:** Wayne performs the third solo - This is not necessarily true. The third solo is a traditional piece, and we don't know if Wayne has performed a modern piece before the third solo.\n* **Option C:** Zara performs the fifth solo - This is not necessarily true. We know X cannot perform the fifth solo, but we don't know if Zara is X.\n* **Option D:** The second solo is a traditional piece - This is not necessarily true. We only know that X cannot perform the fifth solo, but we don't know if the second solo is a traditional piece.\n* **Option E:** The fourth solo is a modern piece - This **must** be true. If the second solo is performed by X, then X cannot perform the fifth solo. Therefore, the fourth solo must be performed by the other pianist (either Wayne or Zara), and it must be a modern piece to satisfy the condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
