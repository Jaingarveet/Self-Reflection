Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the rules that govern the problem.\n - Always analyze each option and compare it to the rules.\n - Always identify any violations of the rules in each option.\n - Always eliminate options that violate the rules.\n - Always choose the option that satisfies all the rules.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and analysis to ensure accuracy.\n - Be explicit in your reasoning and analysis.\n - Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.\n - Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions that may influence your reasoning.\n"

        "content": "## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:\n**Mistake:** In my previous attempt, I incorrectly assigned parking space #1 to Young, violating the rule that Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young.\n**Reasoning:** I focused on the individual rules related to Young and Robertson but failed to consider the combined implication of both rules.\n**Learning:** It's crucial to analyze all rules holistically and consider their combined implications to avoid such mistakes.\n## Applying the Learning to the Current Question:\n**Step 1: Identify the Rules:**\n1. Young > Togowa\n2. Xu > Souza\n3. Robertson > Young\n4. Robertson: #1, #2, #3, or #4\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Option:**\n**A:** Violates rule 3 (Robertson < Young)\n**B:** Violates rule 1 (Young < Togowa)\n**C:** Violates rule 2 (Xu < Souza)\n**D:** **Valid** (satisfies all rules)\n**E:** Violates rule 3 (Robertson < Young)\n**Step 3: Choose the Valid Option:**\nBased on the analysis, only option D satisfies all the rules.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
