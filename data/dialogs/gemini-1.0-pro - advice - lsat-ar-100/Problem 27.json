The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I previously answered that Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill review Tamerlane. This was incorrect because the prompt states that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.\n* **Reasoning:** I made this mistake because I did not carefully consider the condition that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other. I focused on the condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, but I did not consider the implications of this condition for the other students.\n* **Correction:** To correct this mistake, I need to identify two students who review the same play or plays as each other, and who also review Tamerlane. The only option that satisfies both of these conditions is **B: Kramer and O'Neill**.\n**Answer:**\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
