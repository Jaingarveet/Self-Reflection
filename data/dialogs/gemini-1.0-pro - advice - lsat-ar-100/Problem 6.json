The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Be cautious of making assumptions based on incomplete information.\n- Focus on identifying the relative comparisons and absolute values explicitly stated in the problem.\n- Analyze the choices systematically, considering all possibilities allowed by the available information.\n- Choose the answer that is definitively true, even if other possibilities remain.\n"

However, I failed to consider the additional information that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This oversight led to an incorrect conclusion.\n* **Correction:** To avoid such mistakes in the future, I will pay closer attention to all the conditions provided in the problem and ensure that my reasoning is consistent with all of them. I will also double-check my assumptions and conclusions before selecting an answer.\n**Analysis:**\n* **Relative Comparisons:**\n    * Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n    * Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n    * Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n* **Absolute Values:**\n    * Exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n**Choices Analysis:**\n* **A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.** This could be true, but it is not definitively stated.\n* **B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.** This is not necessarily true. Jiang could review the same number of plays as Megregian.\n* **C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.** This could be true, but it is not definitively stated.\n* **D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.** This could be true, but it is not definitively stated.\n* **E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.** This is not necessarily true. Kramer could review the same number of plays as O'Neill.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only statement that is definitively true based on the given information is that **Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does**. This is because Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, and Megregian does not review any play Jiang reviews.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")**"
