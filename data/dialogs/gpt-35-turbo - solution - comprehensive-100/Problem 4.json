What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.\nIt takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.\nLet's assume the length of the space shuttle is \"L\".\nDuring the 40 seconds, the space shuttle covers a distance of 17.5L m.\nThe total distance covered by the space shuttle is the sum of the distance covered in 40 seconds and the distance covered in 5 seconds.\nTotal distance = 17.5L + 87.5\nBut we know that the total distance is 700m.\nTherefore, 17.5L + 87.5 = 700\n17.5L = 612.5\nL = 35\nThe length of the space shuttle is 35 x 2 = 70m.\n"
