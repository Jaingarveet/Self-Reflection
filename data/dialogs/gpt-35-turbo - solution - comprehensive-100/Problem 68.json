Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 0\n  B: 4\n  C: 8\n  D: 16\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.\nSubstituting $x=[REDACTED]$ and $y=[REDACTED]$ in the equation of the line gives $-k=\\frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$.\nSimplifying this equation gives $k^2-[REDACTED]k+[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]$.\nFactoring this equation gives $(k-[REDACTED])(k-[REDACTED])=[REDACTED]$, so $k=[REDACTED]$ is a repeated root.\nHowever, the question asks for which of the following could be the value of $k$, not which is the only possible value of $k$.\nTherefore, we need to check the other answer choices to see if they could also be values of $k$.\nSubstituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives the equation $y=\\frac{[REDACTED]}{-2}x$, which does not pass through the point $(2,k)=(2,[REDACTED])$.\nSubstituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives the equation $y-[REDACTED]=\\frac{2[REDACTED]}{6}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y=[REDACTED]x-[REDACTED]$.\nThis equation passes through the origin and the point $(2,k)=(2,[REDACTED])$, so $k=[REDACTED]$ is a possible value of $k$.\nSubstituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives the equation $y-[REDACTED]=\\frac{[REDACTED]}{1[REDACTED]}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y=\\frac{[REDACTED]}{7}x+\\frac{[REDACTED]}{7}$.\nThis equation does not pass through the point $(k,32)=([REDACTED],32)$.\nTherefore, the only possible value of $k$ is $k=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }[REDACTED]}$.\n"
