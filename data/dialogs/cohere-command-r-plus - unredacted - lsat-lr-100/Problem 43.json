        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love \"until death do us part.\" If \"love\" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\nQuestion: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: None of our feelings are within our control.\n  B: People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control.\n  C: \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings.\n  D: Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.\n  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I misinterpreted the ethicist's argument and the assumptions being made. I focused on the control aspect, which is addressed in option B, but this is not the primary assumption the argument relies on. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overlooking key details\n- Logical error\n\nSolution: The ethicist's argument centers around the logical interpretation of promises and vows. The key assumption is that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense and is reasonable. \n\nThe ethicist argues that if \"love\" refers to feelings, the promise becomes illogical, as feelings are not within one's control. Therefore, the logical assumption being made is that: \nD: Promises should not be interpreted in a way that renders them meaningless or illogical. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Carefully read and understand the ethicist's argument and conclusion. \n2. Identify the key premise and the logical connection being made. \n3. Recognize that the argument revolves around the interpretation of promises, specifically avoiding illogical interpretations. \n4. Understand that option D directly addresses this interpretation aspect, while the other options only tangentially relate to the main point. \n5. Choose option D as the correct answer. \n\nAdvice: \n- Focus on the central point of the argument and identify the key assumption being made. \n- Ensure you fully understand the context and implications of the argument before selecting an answer. \n- Avoid being misled by options that only partially address the argument or focus on secondary aspects. \n- Recognize that logical arguments often hinge on specific interpretations or definitions, so pay close attention to these nuances. \n- Always double-check your understanding of the argument and the assumptions being presented.\n"
