One of J or K will participate, but not both.\n3. If J participates, then G participates.\n4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.\n\nFrom condition 1, we can conclude that either E or F will participate, but not both. Let's assume that E participates.\n\nFrom condition 2, we can conclude that either J or K will participate, but not both. Let's assume that J participates.\n\nFrom condition 3, we can conclude that G will participate if J participates.\n\nFrom condition 4, we can conclude that M will not participate if F does not participate.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible combinations of players:\n\n1. E and F: This combination does not meet condition 1, as both E and F will participate.\n2. E and G: This combination meets condition 1, but not condition 2, as G does not participate if J participates.\n3. E and K: This combination meets condition 1, but not condition 2, as K does not participate if J participates.\n4. F and G: This combination meets condition 2, but not condition 1, as neither F nor G will participate if E participates.\n5. F and K: This combination meets condition 2, but not condition 1, as neither F nor K will participate if E participates.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) G and K.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
