However, upon further reflection, I realize that this choice cannot weaken the argument. The argument states that free speech is essential for the government to hear the demands of the people, which can help the government meet their needs. Disrupting social order may hinder the ability of the government to hear these demands, but it does not necessarily negate the need for free speech. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument states that free speech is essential for the government to meet the needs of the people. Disrupting social order may hinder the ability of the government to hear the demands of the people, but it does not necessarily negate the need for free speech. Good social order is also essential for meeting the needs of the masses, but this does not mean that free speech is unnecessary. Therefore, choice D is the correct answer."
