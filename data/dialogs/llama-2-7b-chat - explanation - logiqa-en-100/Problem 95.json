He uses the example of 1.3 billion to illustrate this point.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the context of the statement. I thought it was a statement about the number of people in China, rather than the significance of that number. I realized my mistake after re-reading the question and understanding the context of Premier Wen Jiabao's statement.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is (B) China's large population makes China's affairs very complicated and arduous, so remember to be cautious for politicians. This answer accurately reflects the meaning of Premier Wen Jiabao's statement, which is that China's large population can make its affairs complex and challenging for politicians to handle."
