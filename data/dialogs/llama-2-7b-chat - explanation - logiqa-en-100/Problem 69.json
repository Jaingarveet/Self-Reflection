My mistake was in not carefully considering the information provided.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that:\n\n* Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.\n* After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.\n\nSo, if Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, then Zhang Shan's bonus must be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
