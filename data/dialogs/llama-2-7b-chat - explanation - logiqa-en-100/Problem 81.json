I realized that I had misunderstood the argument and the information provided. I also noticed that there was additional information in the passage that could be used to support the argument.\n\nThe correct answer is (B): During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%.At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage states that the total length of the stomata system has reached the limit, and if the total length exceeds this limit, the oxygen supply capacity will be insufficient. This suggests that the size of insects is determined by the amount of oxygen available. The argument is supported by the fact that during the Carboniferous period, when the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere was much higher than it is now, there were many giant insects on earth. This suggests that a higher oxygen content can support larger insects.\n\n(A) is not supported by the passage, as it mentions invertebrates in the ocean, but does not provide any information about their size or oxygen content.\n\n(C) is not relevant to the argument, as it only mentions the survival of locusts in different oxygen environments, but does not provide any information about the size of insects.\n\n(D) is not supported by the passage, as it mentions the survival of fruit flies under high oxygen conditions, but does not provide any information about their size or the relationship between oxygen content and insect size."
