This implies that these methods are important for creative thinking and innovation in science, which is the assumption in option [REDACTED].\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that organized, step-by-step reasoning is essential for general scientific research. In fact, the passage highlights the importance of creative thinking and non-linear problem-solving in scientific breakthroughs.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because the passage does not provide evidence that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs. While the passage suggests that they use image thinking methods more frequently than other scientists, it does not provide any specific examples of their achievements.\n\nOption [REDACTED] is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that Nobel Prize winners are smarter or harder than other scientists. The passage focuses on the differences in thinking styles rather than cognitive abilities.\n"
