Upon further reflection, I realized that the conditions given in the problem must be followed to ensure a valid arrangement.\n\nHere is the correct analysis of the options:\n\nOption A: Before? H Middle? P After? K\n\nInvalid: H cannot be in the middle position if K is in the same team as H. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.\n\nOption B: Before? H Middle? L After? N\n\nInvalid: L cannot be in the middle position if H is in the same team as L. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.\n\nOption C: Before? G In? Q After? P\n\nInvalid: G cannot be in the middle position if Q is in the same team as G. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.\n\nOption D: Before? G In? Q After? N\n\nInvalid: N cannot be in the same team as P. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the only valid arrangement for the second team's performance is Option B: Before? H Middle? L After? N."
