I realized that I had made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI mistakenly assumed that the expert's claim that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River was based on the clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area. However, upon further reflection, I realized that this is not the only factor to consider.\n\nThe correct answer is (B): 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge. This means that the majority of ships that pass through the Nanjing Bridge are not affected by its height, as they are already moored at ports below the bridge. This calls into question the expert's claim that the bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River.\n\nAdditionally, (C) is not a valid answer, as the height of the Yangtze River Bridge in other locations is not relevant to the expert's claim.\n\nIn conclusion, my initial answer was incorrect, and I was able to identify the mistake through self-reflection. The correct answer is (B), as the majority of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, which means that the bridge's height is not a significant factor in hindering the passage of giant ships."
