Choice [REDACTED] refutes this conclusion by providing an alternative explanation: the cave could have been a cemetery and funeral venue. This alternative interpretation suggests that the artifacts and utensils might have accumulated over time due to funeral practices, rather than indicating a large number of inhabitants.\n"
