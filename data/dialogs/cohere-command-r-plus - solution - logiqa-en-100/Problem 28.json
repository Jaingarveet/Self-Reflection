E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.\nQuestion: Which two of the following players will be selected by the coach to make the four-person team the only choice?\nChoices:\n  A: F and H\n  C: G and M\n  B: G and J\n  D: H and M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven constraints:\n- E or F will participate, but not both.\n- J or K will participate, but not both.\n- If J participates, then G participates.\n- If F does not participate, M does not participate.\n\nLet's start by considering the options for E and F:\n- Case 1: E participates, F does not.\n- Case 2: E does not participate, F does participates.\n\nFor Case 1:\nSelecting E means we cannot choose F. Now, let's consider J and K. If we select J, then G must also be selected. So, the team so far could be {E, G, J} with one spot remaining. M is not an option because F is not selected. So, the fourth player must be H or K. Therefore, one possible team is {E, G, J, H}.\n\nFor Case 2:\nSimilarly, if we select F, we cannot choose E or M. Choosing J would lead to the team {F, G, J} with one spot left, which could be H or K. So, another possible team is {F, G, J, H}.\n\nThe only two possible teams that meet all the constraints are {E, G, J, H} and {F, G, J, H}, corresponding to choice [REDACTED].\n"
