Even if the house is not a \"small property house,\" the argument's conclusion remains valid because it relies on the lack of legal protection for such houses.\n\nChoice [REDACTED] introduces new information that some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses. This information weakens the argument because it suggests that the legal status of \"small property houses\" is not clear-cut. If some newly built houses in the same village are not considered \"small property houses\" and may be protected by law, then the conclusion that all such houses are automatically unprotected is questionable.\n"

If some newly built houses in Hexi Village are not considered \"small property houses,\" then the conclusion that all such houses are automatically unprotected becomes questionable. This choice challenges the premise that all small property houses can be easily identified and uniformly unprotected. \n\nWhile choices \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" provide additional information, they do not directly undermine the relationship between the classification of houses and their legal protection.\n\nTherefore, choice \"D\" is the correct answer as it casts doubt on the argument's underlying assumption.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
