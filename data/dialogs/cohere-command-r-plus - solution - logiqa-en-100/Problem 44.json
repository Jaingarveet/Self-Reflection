Any car equipped with airbags may experience a car accident.\n  B: Ignore this possibility? Owners without airbags pay more attention to driving cautiously.\n  C: Improper assumption?

However, this ignores other possible factors, such as the number of cars with airbags on the road overall or the driving behavior of owners with or without airbags.\n\nChoice A points out that the argument assumes any car with an airbag may be in an accident, which is true and necessary for the comparison made in the argument. Choice C is irrelevant, as it discusses the functionality of airbags, which is not the focus of the argument. Choice D introduces a new factor - the seriousness of injury - which is not relevant to the argument, which focuses on the incidence of accidents, not the severity.\n\nChoice B is the correct answer as it highlights a potential behavioral difference between owners with and without airbags, which could be a significant factor in the statistics but is not considered in the argument.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
