Statement 1 can be true or false, and statement 2 implies that friends have monetary value. \n\nNow, let's examine choice [REDACTED]: \"[REDACTED]\" This choice introduces a conditional statement that directly addresses the relationship between \"friends\" and \"money.\" If friends are worth a lot of money, then it contradicts the idea that \"money is like dung.\" This choice correctly identifies the logical relationship and refutes the fallacy.\n"
