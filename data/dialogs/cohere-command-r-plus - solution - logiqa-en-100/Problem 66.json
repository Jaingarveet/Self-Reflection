(1) F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.(2) I and E are adjacent.(3) G is somewhere in the north of F.\nQuestion: If it is found that G is the northernmost island, how many possible arrangements are there for this group of islands?\nChoices:\n  A: 2\n  B: 3\n  C: 4\n  D: 5\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that G is the northernmost island and F is adjacent to H, we can determine that G, F, and H must appear in that order from north to south. However, the relative positions of E and I can vary, leading to multiple possible arrangements:\n\n1. G, F, H, E, I\n[REDACTED]. G, F, E, H, I\n[REDACTED]. G, F, H, I, E\n[REDACTED].
