I initially selected \"C\" as the answer, as the other options seemed to suggest human influence. However, the correct answer is \"B\". This is because option \"B\" does not provide any information about the cause of grassland degradation; it simply states an observation about the height of grass in different locations, which does not directly challenge the theory.\n\nThought: \nTo question the opinion that the sand and dust storms are inevitable natural disasters caused by grassland degradation and desertification due to climate drought, we need to consider evidence that suggests human influence or alternative causes.\n\nOption A, C, and D all provide evidence of human influence or alternative causes. Option B simply states an observation without providing information about the cause, and thus cannot be used to question the above opinion.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
