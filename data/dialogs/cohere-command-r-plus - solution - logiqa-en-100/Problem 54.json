This is a narrow view and doesn't consider the broader definition of 'excellence'.\n\nChoice C is incorrect as it implies that profitability is a prerequisite for striving for excellence, which isn't necessarily true. Excellence can be pursued regardless of industry profitability, and it may even help improve profitability.\n\nChoice D is the correct answer. It captures the essence of the changed perspective, where the evaluation of success is no longer solely based on financial metrics but on a broader set of criteria that define 'good' and 'bad' within the industry context.\n\nAnswer: D"
