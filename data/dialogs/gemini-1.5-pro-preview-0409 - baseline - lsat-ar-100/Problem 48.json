Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the second day.\n  C: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  D: Yuki tests H on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n"
