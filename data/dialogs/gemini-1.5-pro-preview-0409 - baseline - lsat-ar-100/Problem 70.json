        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which one of the following targets could be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target\n  B: Image's voicemail target\n  C: Solide's website target\n  D: Truvest's voicemail target\n  E: Truvest's website target\n"

This would mean Truvest's voicemail target is also 3 days (as it cannot be shorter than the website target), making Image's voicemail target impossible to set (it has to be shorter than all other voicemail targets).\n*  Therefore, the only remaining option is Image's website target. \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
