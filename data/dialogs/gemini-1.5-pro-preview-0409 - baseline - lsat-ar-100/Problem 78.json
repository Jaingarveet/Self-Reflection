Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n"

This leaves Monday for Robert, satisfying the \"different days\" condition (eliminating C).\n*   Olivia cannot present in the afternoon, and with Robert on Monday and George on Tuesday, the only remaining afternoon slot is Wednesday, making D impossible.\n*   With Robert on Monday and George on Tuesday, Helen presenting on Wednesday is possible (keeping A).\n*   Robert presenting on Wednesday is impossible due to the established schedule (eliminating E).\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
