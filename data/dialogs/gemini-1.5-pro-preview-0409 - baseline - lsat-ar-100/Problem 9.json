Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n"

So, A is not possible.\n*   **B:** If Young is in #2, then Robertson must be in #1. This satisfies all conditions. So, B is possible.\n*   **C & D:** If Robertson is in #3 or Souza is in #3, then Young and Xu would need to be in #4-6, leaving no space for Robertson to be higher than Young. So, C and D are not possible.\n*   **E:**  Vaughn's position doesn't affect the given rules and conditions. So, E is possible.\nTherefore, both B and E could be true. However, since we can only choose one, we'll go with the one that directly addresses the question about Young's position.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
