The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n"

This leaves only one remaining spot for either Novetzke or Landon. However, if Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia (Constraint 4), leaving no place for Novetzke, which violates Constraint 1 (either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned). \nTherefore, the scenario where Ong is not assigned creates a contradiction.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
