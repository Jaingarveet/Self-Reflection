Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\n"

This leaves space 7 for the second restaurant. To maintain a gap of two spaces between restaurants, the remaining spaces (3, 5, and 6) must be filled by the toy store, optometrist/veterinarian (whichever is not in space 2), and the remaining business.  In this scenario, the shoe store (space 4) cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n*  If the pharmacy is at space 7, the veterinarian or optometrist takes space 6. This leaves space 1 for the second restaurant.  Similar to the previous scenario, spaces 2, 3, and 5 will be filled by the remaining businesses, ensuring the shoe store (space 4) is not next to the veterinarian.\nTherefore, in both possible arrangements, the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
