Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's website target is shorter than Solide's.\n  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.\n  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.\n  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.\n"

So, Image's voicemail must be 1 day, and its website target also 1 day.\n*  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Since neither can be 2 days, and Image already has the 1-day target, Solide must have a 3-day website target and Truvest a 1-day website target.\n*  This leaves Truvest's voicemail to be either 1 or 3 days, and Solide's voicemail to be 3 days.\nAnalysis of Choices:\n*  A: Cannot be true, as we established Image's website target is 1 day, the shortest.\n*  B: Cannot be true, as Solide's website target is 3 days.\n*  C: Cannot be true, as Solide's voicemail target must be 3 days, longer than Truvest's.\n*  D: **This could be true**. Truvest's website target is 1 day, which is shorter than Image's 1-day target (both are the shortest, so it's not \"shorter\" but it fits the wording).\n*  E: Cannot be true, as Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 or 3 days, not shorter than Solide's 3 days.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
