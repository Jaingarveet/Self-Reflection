The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fourth.\n  B: H is sixth.\n  C: R is fourth.\n  D: R is seventh.\n  E: Y is fifth.\n"

This means finance, nutrition, and wildlife articles must alternate.\n*   **Condition 2:** S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n*   **Condition 3:** S must be earlier than Y.\n*   **Condition 4:** J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This means the order for finance articles is J-G-R.\nLet's analyze each option:\n*   **A: H is fourth:** This doesn't provide enough information to determine the full order.\n*   **B: H is sixth:** This means the order for nutrition articles is Q-S-H. Combining with condition 4 (J-G-R), we still don't know the position of Y. \n*   **C: R is fourth:** This means the order for finance articles is J-G-R, and R is followed by a nutrition article (either Q or S). However, we still don't know the exact order of Q, S, and H, nor the position of Y.\n*   **D: R is seventh:** This means the order for finance articles is J-G-R. Since R is last, it must be preceded by a nutrition article (either Q or S).  From condition 3 (S before Y), and knowing Y cannot be last, Y must be sixth. This forces S to be fifth and Q to be third. This satisfies condition 2 and fully determines the order: J-?-Q-G-S-Y-R (the ? is H, the remaining nutrition article).\n*   **E: Y is fifth:** This doesn't provide enough information to determine the full order.\nTherefore, the order is fully determined if R is seventh. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
