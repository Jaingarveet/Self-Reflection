At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n"

Since O must be above L, it must be on the middle shelf with I.  K must be above F, so it's either on the middle or top shelf.  This still leaves possibilities for the placement of G and H.\n**D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nThis would mean M, F, and H are on the same shelf. Since K must be above F, it's either on the middle or top shelf. We still don't know the exact placement of G, O, and L.\n**E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.**\nSince O must be above L, L must be on the bottom shelf. F cannot be on the top shelf (as it's below K), so F and M must be on the bottom shelf with L. This leaves K and G for the middle shelf with I, and H and O for the top shelf. This option definitively places all books. \nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
