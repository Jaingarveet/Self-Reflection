The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

The key is to identify the option that is LEAST helpful in supporting the conclusion that at least one type of memory doesn't decline with age.\n**Possible Error Sources:**\n* **Misinterpreting \"Least Helpful\":** I might have mistakenly looked for the option that actively weakens the conclusion, rather than the one that provides the least support.\n* **Focusing on Irrelevant Details:** I might have been distracted by information that doesn't directly relate to the memory aspect being studied.\n* **Overlooking Subtle Differences:** The choices might be similar, requiring careful analysis to distinguish their impact on the conclusion.\n## Answering the Question:\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A:** Having the same number of people in each group strengthens the comparison by ensuring the sample size isn't skewed. \n* **B:** The consistency of the researchers answering the calls ensures uniformity in the experiment, but it doesn't directly relate to the memory aspect being studied.\n* **C:** This reinforces the age difference between the groups but doesn't provide additional information about memory.\n* **D:** Equal access to telephones ensures that external factors didn't influence the results, strengthening the conclusion.\n* **E:** Similar instruction time ensures fairness and comparability between the groups.\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B, while ensuring consistency in the experiment, is the least helpful in directly supporting the conclusion about memory and aging. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
