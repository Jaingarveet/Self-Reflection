        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Error:\n**Error Analysis:**\nMy previous answer to this question was incorrect because I misinterpreted the relationship between the statements. I focused on the fact that prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals, but I failed to consider the scope and direction of this relationship. \n**Understanding the Correct Answer:**\nThe correct answer should be a statement that is **necessarily true** given the premises. It should not introduce new information or make assumptions beyond what is stated.\n**Key Takeaways:**\n* **Focus on the direction of the relationship:** The context states that Lac Nichoutec winners **also** won at international festivals, not the other way around.\n* **Consider the scope:** The statement refers to **most** prize-winning films, not all. This leaves room for exceptions.\n* **Avoid assumptions:**  Don't assume information that is not explicitly stated.\n## Answering the Question:\nLet's analyze each option based on the above understanding:\n* **A:** This reverses the direction of the relationship. We don't know if international festival winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n* **B:** This introduces new information about the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec. We only know about prize-winning films.\n* **C:** This aligns with the given information. If Lac Nichoutec winners (which are Canadian films) also won at international festivals, then some international winners must be Canadian. \n* **D:** This is possible but not necessarily true. The statement allows for the possibility that all Lac Nichoutec winners were also shown internationally.\n* **E:** This introduces information about films not shown at Lac Nichoutec, which is beyond the scope of the context.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is that some international prize-winning films were Canadian.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
