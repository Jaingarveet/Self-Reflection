Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

We need to find an option that supports this connection between equal penalties and perceived equal harm.\n## Evaluating Choices:\n*   **A:** This aligns with the general principle of proportionality in sentencing but doesn't specifically address the comparison between theft and bribery.\n*   **B:** This discusses the role of harm in criminalization, not the specific comparison of harm between two already criminalized acts. \n*   **C:** This talks about increasing penalties for unusually harmful instances, not the equivalence of harm between two crimes.\n*   **D:** **This directly supports the argument.** If victims of theft and bribery experience similar levels of harm, it strengthens the idea that lawmakers perceive the harms as equal, justifying equal penalties.\n*   **E:** This discusses the effectiveness of deterrence, not the connection between equal penalties and perceived equal harm.\n## Conclusion:\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
