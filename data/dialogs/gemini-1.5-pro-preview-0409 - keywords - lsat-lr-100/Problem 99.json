However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

The key is to identify the assumption that bridges the gap between the premise (freedom of thought allows pursuing ideas) and the conclusion (the argument for freedom of thought fails).\n## Analysis of Choices:\n*   **A:** This choice discusses limitations within a specific orthodoxy, which is not the central theme of the argument. \n*   **B:** The context of society's values is not discussed in the argument.\n*   **C:** The professor doesn't claim thinkers lack discipline in societies with freedom of thought.\n*   **D:** This choice supports freedom of thought, contradicting the professor's conclusion.\n*   **E:**  This option states that intellectual discipline is a prerequisite for freedom of thought. This aligns with the professor's implication that without discipline, the full potential of ideas cannot be explored, hindering intellectual progress.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
