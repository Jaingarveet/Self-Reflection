Instead of focusing on the presence or absence of immoral characters, the key difference lies in the **portrayal** of these characters and their impact on children.\n**Improved Approach:**\n1. **Identify the Disagreement:** Peter believes children's stories lack clearly immoral characters and should have them to teach consequences. Yoko argues that such characters still exist but are less frightening, which is positive.\n2. **Analyze Choices:**\n    - **A and B:** These options address the fear factor, which is only part of the disagreement.\n    - **C:** The quality of stories is not discussed.\n    - **D:** Both agree on the presence of immoral characters, so this isn't the point of contention.\n    - **E:** This aligns with Peter's view but doesn't encompass the full disagreement.\n**Conclusion:** The disagreement revolves around the portrayal of immoral characters and their impact on children, specifically regarding the fear factor.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
