It is caused by dysfunctional cilia, which are small hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract and help move mucus and debris out of the lungs.\nCiliary dyskinesia is a hallmark feature of Kartagener's syndrome, as the dysfunctional cilia are unable to effectively clear mucus from the lungs, leading to chronic respiratory infections and bronchiectasis.\nPancreatic insufficiency is not a feature of Kartagener's syndrome.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
