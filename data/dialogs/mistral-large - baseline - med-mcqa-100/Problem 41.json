        "content": "Thought:\nChemical peeling is a technique used to improve the appearance of the skin. It involves applying a chemical solution to the skin, which causes it to exfoliate and eventually peel off. The new, regenerated skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin.\nThe agents commonly used in chemical peeling are alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and phenol.\nGlycolic acid, kojic acid, and salicylic acid are all types of AHAs or BHAs. Phenol is a stronger agent used for deeper peels.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nKojic acid is not an agent used in chemical peeling. It is a skin-lightening agent derived from certain fungi. It is often used in cosmetic products to treat hyperpigmentation and age spots. However, it is not used as a chemical peeling agent."
