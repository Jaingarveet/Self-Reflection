With time this patient's pancreas is expected to undergo progressive fibrosis with atrophy of the exocrine glands and cystic dilation of the ducts.

The basic abnormality in cystic fibrosis involves a defective gene that regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. This leads to thick, sticky mucus in various organs, including the pancreas.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C: Decreased glycosylated chloride channel\" because the defective gene in cystic fibrosis encodes for a protein called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), which functions as a chloride channel. The mutation in the CFTR gene results in decreased activity of this channel, leading to the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
