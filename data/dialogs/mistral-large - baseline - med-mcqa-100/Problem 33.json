The salt split skin technique is used to determine the location of the antigen-antibody complex. In cicatricial pemphigoid, the antigen is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique.\nThe antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid is BP230, which is a component of the hemidesmosome. However, none of the given choices match this antigen.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\nExplanation:\nAlthough the correct answer is not listed, XVII collagen is the closest option. XVII collagen is a transmembrane protein that is a component of hemidesmosomes and is involved in the adhesion of the epidermis to the basement membrane. It is also known as BP180, which is a major antigen in bullous pemphigoid, another subepidermal blistering disorder. However, BP180 is not the primary antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid. Therefore, the best answer among the given choices is XVII collagen."
