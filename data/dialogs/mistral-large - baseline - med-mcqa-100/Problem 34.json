It is caused by an overreaction of the immune system to environmental allergens such as pollen.\nThe four types of hypersensitivity reactions are:\n\n* Type I: immediate hypersensitivity, mediated by IgE antibodies and mast cells/basophils (e.g., anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis)\n* Type II: cytotoxic hypersensitivity, mediated by IgG or IgM antibodies and complement (e.g., hemolytic anemia, Goodpasture's disease)\n* Type III: immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity, mediated by antigen-antibody complexes and complement (e.g., serum sickness, Arthus reaction)\n* Type IV: delayed-type hypersensitivity, mediated by T cells (e.g., contact dermatitis, tuberculin reaction)\n\nSpring catarrh is a type I hypersensitivity reaction.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
