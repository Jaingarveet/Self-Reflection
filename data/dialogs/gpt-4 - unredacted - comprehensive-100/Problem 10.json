If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?\nChoices:\n  A: Rs 400\n  B: Rs 500\n  C: Rs 600\n  D: Rs 700\n  E: Rs 800\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question correctly, but I did not provide the answer in the correct format. The error was not in my mathematical reasoning or calculation, but in the way I presented my answer. \nError Keywords:\n- Formatting error\n- Answer presentation error\nSolution:\nLet's denote the amount each nephew receives as x. \nThen each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. \nThe total amount is 8600, so we can set up the equation: \n5 sons * 5x + 4 daughters * 4x + 2 nephews * x = 8600\nSolving this equation will give us the value of x, and then we can find out how much each daughter receives.\nFirst, simplify the equation: \n25x + 16x + 2x = 8600\n43x = 8600\nx = 8600 / 43 = 200\nEach daughter receives 4x = 4 * 200 = 800\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the unknowns and denote them with variables.\n2. Set up an equation based on the problem.\n3. Simplify the equation.\n4. Solve the equation to find the value of the variable.\n5. Use the value of the variable to find the required amount.\n6. Present your answer in the correct format: Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\").\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Always present your answer in the correct format.\n"
