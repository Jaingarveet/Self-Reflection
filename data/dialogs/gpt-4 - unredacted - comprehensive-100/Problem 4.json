What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI miscalculated the length of the space shuttle. I made an error in my multiplication, which led to an incorrect answer. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Multiplication error\n - Arithmetic error\nSolution:\nThe space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. \nIf it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. \nThe correct answer is not in the choices because I made a calculation error. The correct calculation is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m, which rounds to 88 m. The closest value to 88 m is 100 m. \nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the maximum speed of the space shuttle by dividing the distance it can travel at maximum speed by the time it takes to travel that distance.\n2. Multiply the maximum speed by the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point to find the length of the shuttle.\n3. Round your answer to the nearest whole number if necessary.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n - Break down complex problems into simpler steps.\n - Work through each step of your calculations carefully.\n - Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember to round your answer to the nearest whole number if necessary.\n"
