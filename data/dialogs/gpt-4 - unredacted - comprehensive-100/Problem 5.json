If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in solving the equation. I incorrectly calculated the value of n, which represents the number of members in the club. \nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Algebraic error\n- Solving equations\nSolution:\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\nWe can set up the equation: 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25) and solve for n.\nSolving this equation gives n = 25.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem and identify the given values.\n2. Write down the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).\n3. Substitute the given values into the formula.\n4. Solve the equation for n, which represents the number of members in the club.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Be careful when solving equations, and double-check your calculations.\n- Remember the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and how to apply it.\n- Practice solving similar problems to improve your skills and accuracy.\n"
