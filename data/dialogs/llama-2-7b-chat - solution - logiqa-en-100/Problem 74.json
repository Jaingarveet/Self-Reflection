Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\n2. Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time.\n3. Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA) Tang Xiaohua - Since Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, it means that Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected with Guo Yanran. Therefore, the answer is B: Peng Youwen.\n\nHowever, I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is actually C: Qiu Zhijie.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's assume that He Zhilian is not selected. We need to find out which of the remaining options is not selected.\n\nOption A: Tang Xiaohua - As mentioned earlier, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected with Guo Yanran, so if He Zhilian is not selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.\n\nOption B: Peng Youwen - Since Peng Youwen and Song Kaiwen are not selected at the same time, it means that Peng Youwen cannot be selected with any of the other girls.\n\nOption C: Qiu Zhijie - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua are not selected at the same time, so if He Zhilian is not selected, Qiu Zhijie is the only option left that is not selected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: Qiu Zhijie.\n\nReflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer by selecting Tang Xiaohua as the option that is not selected. Thank you for pointing that out, and I'm glad I could correct my mistake and provide the correct answer this time."
