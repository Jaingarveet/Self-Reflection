If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used.\n2. Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J.\n3. If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n* If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used, and paper K must be used.\n* If paper G or paper H is used without paper J, then paper J cannot be used.\n\nNow, let's consider the choices:\n\nA: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used.\nThis choice is not consistent with the given information, as we know that paper H cannot be used if paper G is used without paper J. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\n\nB: Both articles G and H are used.\nThis choice is also inconsistent with the given information, as we know that paper H cannot be used if paper G is used without paper J. Therefore, this choice is also incorrect.\n\nC: No paper J, but paper K.\nThis choice is consistent with the given information, as we know that if paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used, and paper K must be used. Additionally, we know that if paper G or paper H is used without paper J, then paper J cannot be used. Therefore, this choice is the best answer.\n\nD: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.\nThis choice is also consistent with the given information, as we know that if paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used, and paper K must be used. Additionally, we know that if paper G or paper H is used without paper J, then paper J cannot be used. Therefore, this choice is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is (C): No paper J, but paper K."
