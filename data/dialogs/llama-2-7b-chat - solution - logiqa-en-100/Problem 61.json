Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nI see that the correct answer is D: M and G are in charge of the same department. Here's how I arrived at this answer:\n\n1. Condition (1) states that there is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time. This means that each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department.\n2. Condition (2) states that F and G are not in charge of the same department. This means that F is not in charge of the department that G is in charge of.\n3. Condition (3) states that H and I are not in charge of the same department. This means that H is not in charge of the department that I is in charge of.\n4. From conditions 2 and 3, we can conclude that M is not in charge of the department that F is in charge of.\n5. Therefore, the only possibility is that M and G are in charge of the same department.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D: M and G are in charge of the same department."
