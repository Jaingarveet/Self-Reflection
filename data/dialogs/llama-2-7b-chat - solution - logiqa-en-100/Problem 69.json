[INCORRECT]\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the correct answer was C. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is B. The information provided in the passage does not allow us to conclude that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's, so option C is not a valid choice. Additionally, option D is also not valid, as the passage does not provide any information about Li Si's bonus being as high as Wang Wu's.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's."
