The statement in the stem is true, and it highlights the dilemma that celebrities often face when dealing with gossip news in the media. If they don't come forward to clarify and refute the rumors, the public may believe them, which can damage their reputation. However, if they do come forward to clarify and refute, it can attract more attention and make the gossip news spread faster and wider.\n\nReflection: I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I misunderstood the situation. I thought that the celebrity could stop the gossip news from damaging their reputation by not responding to it, but that's not the case. The statement in the stem is true, and the celebrity's silence can actually make the situation worse.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") - The best strategy the celebrity can take is to clarify the truth. By coming forward to clarify and refute the rumors, the celebrity can regain control of the narrative and prevent the gossip news from spreading further.\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is (C) because the celebrity's silence can make the situation worse by allowing the gossip news to spread unchecked. By coming forward to clarify and refute the rumors, the celebrity can regain control of the narrative and prevent the gossip news from spreading further. This is the best strategy for the celebrity to take in this situation."
