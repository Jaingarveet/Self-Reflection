The correct answer is (C) If humans plunder nature, there will be no sustainable life.\n\nExplanation:\nThe sentence states that people who respect themselves, others, and the natural environment are more likely to have a sustainable life. Plundering nature goes against this idea, as it shows a lack of respect for the environment and can lead to unsustainable practices. Therefore, option (C) is the correct answer.\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI realized that I made a mistake in my initial answer by selecting option (A) If a person is careful, he has no taste. This is not supported by the sentence, as it does not mention anything about taste. I also realized that I should have paid closer attention to the wording of the sentence and the relationships between the different parts of the sentence.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
