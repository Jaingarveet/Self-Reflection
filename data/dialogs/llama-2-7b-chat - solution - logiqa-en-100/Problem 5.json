Without free speech, the government may not be aware of the people's needs, and therefore, may not be able to meet them.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nReasoning: Free speech is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential. While free speech is important for the government to hear the demands of the people, it is not enough to ensure that the needs of the masses are met. Good social order is also necessary to ensure that the government can effectively meet the needs of the people.\n\nConclusion: The correct answer is (D) Free speech is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential. Free speech is important for the government to hear the demands of the people, but it is not enough to ensure that the needs of the masses are met. Good social order is also necessary to ensure that the government can effectively meet the needs of the people."
