The correct inference from Confucius' statement is:\n\n\"Don't do what you don't want to do to others.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation: The statement \"Do not do what you don't want to do to others\" implies that one should not perform an action that they themselves do not want to be done to them. This means that if someone does not want something to be done to them, they should not do it to others either. Option C is the only choice that does not logically follow from the given statement."
