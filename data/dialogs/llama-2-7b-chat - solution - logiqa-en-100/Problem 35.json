Here is my reflection:\n\nI mistakenly assumed that if Li was hired by Tianshu, then Liu and Zhao were also hired by Tianshu. However, the information given in the problem states that Li was hired by Tianshu, but Liu and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nI also mistakenly assumed that if Wang was hired by Tianxuan, then Liu and Zhao were also hired by Tianxuan. However, the information given in the problem states that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan, but it does not say that Liu and Zhao were hired by Tianxuan. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the information given in the problem, the correct answer is option B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
