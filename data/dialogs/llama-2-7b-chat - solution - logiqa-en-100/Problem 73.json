To solve this problem, I will use the conditions to determine which pair of magicians can be in team 1.\n\nReflection:\nI will start by using condition (1) to determine that G cannot be in the front. Therefore, G must be in the middle or back.\n\nNext, I will use condition (2) to determine that K must be in the middle.\n\nNow, I will use condition (3) to determine that L must be on team 1. Therefore, L can be in the front or middle of team 1.\n\nUsing condition (4), I can see that P cannot be in the same team as N, so P must be in a different team than N.\n\nFinally, using condition (5), I can see that P cannot be in the same team as Q, so Q must be in a different team than P.\n\nNow, I will use the information I have gathered to determine the possible pairs of magicians that can be in team 1:\n\n* K and L: This pair satisfies all the conditions, as K is in the middle and L is on team 1.\n* L and N: This pair also satisfies all the conditions, as L is in the front and N is not in the same team as P or Q.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) K and L."
