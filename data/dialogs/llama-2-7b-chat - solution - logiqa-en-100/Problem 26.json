The conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not necessarily false just because the first statement \"money is like dung\" is false. The two statements are not necessarily related, and the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation: The statement \"friends are worth a thousand dollars\" is a separate statement from \"money is like dung.\" While the first statement may be false, it does not necessarily imply that the second statement is false as well. The conclusion \"friends are like dung\" is not logically derived from the premises, and therefore it is not a valid conclusion."
