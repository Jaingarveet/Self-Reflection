If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?\nChoices:\n  A: 69:91\n  B: 59:91\n  C: 59:90\n  D: 59:91\n  E: 69:101\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Ratio simplification error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Calculation error\n\nSolution:\nGiven: \nAlloy X = Zn:Cu = 6:9 \nAlloy Y = Zn:Cu = 7:11 \nAlloy Z = (40g of X) + (60g of Y) \n\nCalculations: \nWeight of Z = 40 + 60 = 100g \nWeight of Zn in Z = (6/15 * 40) + (7/18 * 60) = 46g \nWeight of Cu in Z = (9/15 * 40) + (11/18 * 60) = 54g \n\nNow, to find the correct ratio: \nZn:Cu = 46:54 \n\nTo simplify, we can find the common factor: \nCommon factor = 2 (found by factoring 46 and 54) \n\nSimplified ratio: \n(46 รท 2):(54 รท 2) = 23:27 \n\nTo convert this into the required format: \nMultiply both parts by 11 to get whole numbers: \n (23 * 11):(27 * 11) = 253:297 \n\nThis can be simplified further: \n253:297 reduces to [REDACTED] by taking the common factor of 11 \n\nFinal answer: [REDACTED] \n\nChoice [REDACTED] is correct. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given ratios of zinc to copper in alloys X and Y. \n2. Calculate the total weight of alloy Z by adding the weights of X and Y. \n3. Calculate the weight of zinc and copper in alloy Z using their respective ratios. \n4. Determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z based on their weights. \n5. Simplify the ratio by finding the common factor and dividing both parts by it. \n6. Convert the ratio to the required format by multiplying both parts by a suitable number to get whole numbers. \n7. Check for any further simplifications by finding the common factors of the numbers in the ratio. \n8. Choose the answer choice that matches your simplified ratio. \n\nAdvice:\n - Always read and understand the question carefully, especially the units and formats required. \n - Double-check your calculations and any simplifications or conversions you make. \n - Simplify ratios by finding their common factors to get the ratio in its simplest form. \n - Ensure you understand the underlying mathematical concepts, such as ratios, weights, and proportions, to tackle similar problems effectively. \n - Practice similar problems to improve your accuracy and speed.\n"
