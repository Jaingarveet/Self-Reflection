How much do you weigh?\"\nMeenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.\nBut she said, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. \"How much does Meenu weigh?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 28\n  C: 27\n  D: 58\n  E: 91\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in solving the equation for Meenu's weight. \nI incorrectly assumed that \"29 + x/2\" meant \"29 kg plus half of x kg.\" \nHowever, the correct interpretation is \"29 kg plus half of her weight, which is also x kg.\" \nError Keywords:\n - Equation solving error\n - Interpretation error\n - Algebraic error\nSolution:\nLet's represent Meenu's weight as 'x'.\nAccording to the question, she weighs \"29 kg plus half of her weight,\" which can be written as: \nx = 29 + x/2\nNow, let's solve for x: \nCombine like terms: \n2x = 29 + x\n\nSubtract x from both sides:\nx = 29\n\nSo, Meenu weighs 29 kg.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.\n2. Understand the relationship between Silu's and Meenu's weights.\n3. Represent Meenu's weight as an algebraic equation.\n4. Solve the equation step-by-step for 'x'.\n5. Interpret the value of 'x' as Meenu's weight.\n6. Double-check your solution by substituting the value back into the original equation.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of the question and identify any keywords or phrases that indicate relationships or operations.\n - Take your time to understand the context and interpret the information correctly.\n - Always define your variables clearly and represent the problem algebraically.\n - Solve equations step-by-step, being careful with each operation.\n - Double-check your solution by substituting the value back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition.\n"
