Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nChoices:\n  A: 12/25\n  B: 3/2\n  C: 3\n  D: 2\n  E: 25/3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in equating the number of pita breads to the number of rolls. I should have equated it to the number of baguettes. As a result, I incorrectly calculated the final answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Equivalence error\n- Comparison error\n- Calculation error\n\nSolution:\nGiven:\n6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls\n[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes\n\nStep 1: Find the equivalence for [REDACTED] baguettes:\n[REDACTED] baguettes = 5/[REDACTED] rolls (given: [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes)\n\nStep [REDACTED]: Find the equivalence for 5/[REDACTED] rolls in pita breads:\n5/[REDACTED] rolls = 6/5 * 5/[REDACTED] pita breads = [REDACTED] pita breads\n\nTherefore, [REDACTED] baguettes are equivalent to [REDACTED] pita breads.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the given equivalences: 6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls, and [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes.\n[REDACTED]. Find the equivalence for [REDACTED] baguettes in terms of rolls.\n[REDACTED]. Use the given equivalence to find the equivalence of that number of rolls in pita breads.\n4. Express the final answer in the simplest form.\n\nAdvice:\n- Carefully read and understand the relationships given in the question.\n- Identify the relevant information and equivalences that will help you solve the problem.\n- Systematically work through the problem, step-by-step, using the given information.\n- Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are making the correct comparisons and equivalences.\n- Simplify your final answer if possible.\n"
