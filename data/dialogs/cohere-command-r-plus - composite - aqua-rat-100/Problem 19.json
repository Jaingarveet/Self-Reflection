What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\nChoices:\n  A: 126km\n  B: 144km\n  C: 127km\n  D: 228km\n  E: 128km\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Equation setup error\n- Algebraic manipulation error\n- Isolation of variable error\n\nSolution:\n\nLet the distance traveled be 'D' km. \n\nThe speed for the first journey = D/6 km/hr \n\nThe speed for the second journey = (D/4) km/hr \n\nIt is given that the two speeds are equal, so we can set up the equation: \n\nD/6 = D/4 - 12 \n\nMultiplying by 12 to clear the fractions and simplify: \n\n4[REDACTED] = 3[REDACTED] - 72 \n\nAdding 72 and 3[REDACTED] to both sides: \n\n4[REDACTED] + 3[REDACTED] + 72 = 0 \n\nCombining like terms: \n\n7[REDACTED] + 72 = 0 \n\nIsolating [REDACTED]: \n\n[REDACTED] = -72/7 \n\n[REDACTED] = -10.29 (incorrect; this is not a valid answer) \n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the given values: distance (D), time (6 and 4 hours), and speed increase (12 km/hr). \n2. Set up the equation correctly: equal distances in equal times. \n3. Simplify the equation and isolate [REDACTED] correctly: \n   - Multiply by the common denominator to clear fractions. \n   - Combine like terms. \n   - Divide by the coefficient of [REDACTED] to isolate it. \n4. Check your calculations and ensure the units are consistent. \n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result. \n\nAdvice:\n\n- Understand the concept of distance, speed, and time, and how they relate. \n- Set up equations correctly and manipulate them step-by-step, checking each step. \n- Simplify and isolate variables correctly, being mindful of potential errors in sign or coefficients. \n- Double-check your calculations and ensure units are consistent. \n- Ensure your final answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.\n"
