What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly calculated the shuttle's speed and then multiplied that by the time taken to pass a point to find the length. The error was in my calculation of the speed and my understanding of how to apply that value to the next step. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error \n- Speed calculation error \n- Application error \n\nSolution:\nThe shuttle's speed = distance/time = 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. This is its vertical speed. \n\nHowever, to find the length of the shuttle, we need to use a different calculation. The shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so we can find its length by using this formula: \nLength = distance/time = 700m/5s = 140m \n\nThe length of the shuttle is 140 meters, which matches choice [REDACTED]. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the vertical speed of the shuttle using the given distance and time. \n2. Recognize that this speed is for vertical movement, and it is different from the speed at which the shuttle passes a point. \n3. Calculate the length of the shuttle by dividing the given distance (700m) by the time taken to pass a point (5s). \n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result. \n\nAdvice:\n - Read the question carefully to identify the relevant information and the specific calculation required. \n - Understand the difference between vertical speed and the speed at which an object passes a point. \n - Double-check your calculations and ensure you are applying the correct values to the appropriate formulas. \n - Always consider the units of your values and ensure they match the required units for your answer. \n - Practice similar problems to improve your familiarity with these types of calculations.\n"
