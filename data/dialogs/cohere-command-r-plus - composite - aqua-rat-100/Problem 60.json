If B bisects minor arc AC, then what is the measure of minor arc AD?\nChoices:\n  A: 80°\n  B: 130°\n  C: 140°\n  D: 160°\n  E: 220°\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Sign error\n- Subtraction error\n\nSolution:\nGiven that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] (as minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED]). \nTo find minor arc B[REDACTED]: \nminor arc B[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] \nminor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] \nminor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]. \n\nNow, to find minor arc A[REDACTED]: \nminor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] \nminor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] \nminor arc A[REDACTED] = 240°. \n\nThe measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is 240°, which is greater than 1[REDACTED] (half the circle). This indicates that minor arc A[REDACTED] is actually a major arc, and its measure as a minor arc is the complementary angle, which is 1[REDACTED] - 240° = 40°. \n\nSo, minor arc A[REDACTED] = 40°. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given values for minor arcs A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], and the bisected minor arc A[REDACTED] (and BC). \n2. Calculate the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. \n3. Find the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. \n4. Check if the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is greater than half the circle's circumference (1[REDACTED]). \n5. If it is greater, subtract the measure from 1[REDACTED] to find the complementary angle, which represents the minor arc A[REDACTED]. \n\nAdvice:\n - Read the question carefully and identify the given geometric relationships and values. \n - Draw a diagram if needed to visualize the problem. \n - Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring you apply the correct geometric rules and formulas. \n - Double-check your calculations and the final answer, considering any special cases or constraints. \n - Remember that when an arc bisects another, their measures are equal, and the sum of their measures equals the measure of the whole arc.\n"

So, minor arc AD actually represents a major arc. To find the measure of the corresponding minor arc, we take the complement:\nminor arc AD = 180° - 310° = -130°.\n\nConverting this angle to its positive equivalent:\nminor arc AD = 360° + (-130°) = 230°.\n\nSo, the measure of minor arc AD is 230°.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
