Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], including the initial quarter-mile. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question and identify the given information: initial charge, additional charge per unit distance, and budget. \n2. Recognize that the question asks for the maximum distance achievable with a given budget. \n3. Calculate the cost for each additional quarter-mile, not mile. \n4. Start from the initial distance and calculate the cost incrementally up to a reasonable distance, ensuring it doesn't exceed the budget. \n5. Determine the maximum distance achievable within the budget. \n6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated maximum distance. \n\nAdvice:\n - Read the question carefully and identify the specific units and charges. \n - Understand the relationship between distance and cost to optimize distance within the budget. \n - Be precise with units and calculations, ensuring they align with the question's context. \n - Double-check your calculations and the question's specifics to avoid misinterpretations. \n - Remember that the maximum distance is the greatest distance achievable within the given constraints.\n"
