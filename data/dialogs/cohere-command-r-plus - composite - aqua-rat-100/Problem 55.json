I made a simple arithmetic error in adding the equations and determining the value of \"x.\" This led to an incorrect final answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Equation error\n\nSolution:\nLet the man's rate along the current be \"x\" kmph and the current's rate be \"y\" kmph.\nWe can set up a system of equations based on the given information:\nx - y = 2 (the man's rate against the current)\nx + y = 4 (the man's rate in still water)\n\nAdding these equations, we get:\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSubstituting x into the equation x + y = 4:\n3 + y = 4\ny = 1\n\nNow, we can find the man's rate along the current:\nx = 3 kmph\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: 3 kmph**.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the given information: the man's rates in still water and against the current.\n2. Define variables: let 'x' be the man's rate along the current and 'y' be the current's rate.\n3. Set up a system of equations: use the given rates to create two equations.\n4. Solve the system: add the equations to find the value of 'x'.\n5. Substitute and solve: use the value of 'x' to find 'y' by substituting into the second equation.\n6. Interpret the result: the man's rate along the current is 'x' kmph.\n\nAdvice:\n - Clearly define variables and their meanings.\n - Set up equations precisely and double-check them.\n - Solve the system of equations accurately, checking each step.\n - Interpret the solution correctly, ensuring it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n"
