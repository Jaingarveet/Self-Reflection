If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.\nChoices:\n  A: 1584\n  B: 2520\n  C: 1728\n  D: 1656\n  E: None\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Simplification error\n- Fraction manipulation error\n\nSolution:\nLet the number be x. We can represent the problem with the equation: \n(7/18)x = (7/8)x - 770\n\nNow, we can simplify and solve for x: \n(7/18)x + 770 = (7/8)x\n(7/18 + 7/8)x = 770 * 18/8\n(63/72)x = 770 * 9/8\n(7/8)x = 770 * 9\nx = (770 * 9) * (8/7)\nx = [REDACTED]\n\nInstructions:\n1. Set up the equation: (7/18)x = (7/8)x - 770\n2. Simplify the equation: (7/18)x + 770 = (7/8)x\n3. Continue simplifying: (63/72)x = 770 * 9/8\n4. Simplify further: (7/8)x = 770 * 9\n5. Solve for x: x = (770 * 9) * (8/7)\n6. Calculate the value of x: x = [REDACTED]\n\nAdvice:\n - Always distribute multiplication over addition/subtraction when simplifying equations. \n - Take your time when manipulating fractions to avoid errors. \n - Double-check your calculations and simplify fractions where possible. \n - Be cautious when solving for a variable; ensure you are isolating it correctly.\n"
