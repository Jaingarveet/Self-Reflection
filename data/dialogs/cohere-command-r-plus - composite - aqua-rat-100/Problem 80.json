        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy?\nChoices:\n  A: 10,8\n  B: 9,8\n  C: 7,8\n  D: 5,6\n  E: 11,12\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Equation error\n- Algebraic error\n- Interpretation error\n\nSolution:\n\nLet's assume Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18-x) brown sharpeners. \n\nFrom the question, we can write the equations: \n\nx + (18-x) = 18       (this is simply combining like terms, and it ensures the total number of sharpeners is 18)\n\nx + 1 + (18-x) = 100  (the cost of white sharpeners is 1 rupee more, and the total cost is rs. 100)\n\nSolving the equations, we find x = 10 and thus, 18-x = 8. \n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Understand the variables: number of white sharpeners, number of brown sharpeners, and total cost. \n2. Set up the equations: one for the total number of sharpeners and another for the total cost, accounting for the price difference. \n3. Solve the system of equations to find the values of x and 18-x. \n4. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated values. \n\nAdvice:\n\n- Carefully interpret the problem and identify the relevant variables and their relationships. \n- Translate the problem into equations accurately, paying attention to the specific conditions given. \n- Double-check your equations to ensure they represent the problem correctly. \n- Solve the equations methodically, avoiding algebraic mistakes. \n- Always check your answer choices to ensure they align with your calculated values.\n"
