[[REDACTED] + X × 19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[13^2 - 1[REDACTED]6] = 6\n2. X × 19 = 1[REDACTED] + 7 - [REDACTED] = 17\n3. X = 17/19\n[REDACTED]. [[REDACTED] + 17/19 × 19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[169 - 1[REDACTED]6] = 6\n[REDACTED]. Simplify inside the brackets first: [217/19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[12] = 6\n6. Continue calculation inside the brackets: [11.[REDACTED]2 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[12] = 6\n7. Calculate the numerator: [-3.[REDACTED]8 - 7]/[12] = 6\n8. Calculate the numerator: [-10.[REDACTED]8]/[12] = 6\n9. Divide: -10.[REDACTED]8/12 = -0.881666 = 6\n\nThe equation does not hold true, so the correct answer is \"[REDACTED]: There is no such value of X.\"\n\nSolution:\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given equation and the values to be calculated.\n2. Simplify the equation step-by-step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).\n3. Calculate the value of X accurately, ensuring correct division.\n[REDACTED]. Plug the value of X back into the original equation and simplify.\n[REDACTED]. Check if the equation holds true when both sides are equal to 6.\n6. If the equation holds true, choose the appropriate answer option; otherwise, select \"no such value.\"\n\nAdvice:\n- Always follow the correct order of operations to avoid errors in simplification.\n- Pay attention to fractions and divisions; ensure you perform calculations accurately.\n- Double-check your calculations and the final answer.\n- Read the question and answer options carefully to understand the task fully.\n"
