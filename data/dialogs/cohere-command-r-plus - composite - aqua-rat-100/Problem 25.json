The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices:\n  A: 5(√3 + 1)\n  B: 6(√3 + √2)\n  C: 7(√3 – 1)\n  D: 8(√3 – 2)\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly applied the trigonometric identities and made a mistake in simplifying the final expression. I should have paid closer attention to the identities and been more careful in my algebraic manipulations.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Trigonometric identity error\n- Algebraic simplification error\n- Incorrect variable substitution\n\nSolution:\nLet's denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as $x$. Using trigonometry, we can set up the following equations:\n$\\tan(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{x} \\implies x = h$\n$\\tan(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{x - 10} \\implies h = (x - 10)\\tan(60^{\\circ})$\n\nSetting these equations equal to each other and solving for $x$, we get:\n$x = h = (x - 10)\\tan(60^{\\circ})$\n$x = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$\n\nNow, we can find how much farther the car has to travel:\n$x - 10 = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1) - 10 = 5(\\sqrt{3} - 2 + 1) = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1 - 2) = 5(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\nTherefore, it will take $\\mathbf{5(\\sqrt{3} - 1)}$ more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is choice $\\mathbf{A}$.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base as $x$.\n2. Set up trigonometric equations using the angles and ratios: $\\tan(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{x}$ and $\\tan(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{x - 10}$.\n3. Equate these equations and solve for $x$ to find the distance traveled.\n4. Calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$).\n5. Simplify the expression and choose the answer option that matches your result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Carefully apply trigonometric identities and simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step to avoid errors.\n- Double-check your variable substitutions and calculations.\n- Be cautious when dealing with square roots and similar numbers; ensure you don't mistakenly switch or omit any terms.\n"
