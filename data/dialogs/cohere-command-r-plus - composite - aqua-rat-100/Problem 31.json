        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Last year, a Home Appliance Store sold an average(arithmetic mean) of 42 microwave ovens per month. In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?\nChoices:\n  A: 21\n  B: 30\n  C: 31\n  D: 32\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Average calculation error\n- Incorrect sum\n\nSolution:\nFor the first 19 months, an average of 42 microwave ovens were sold per month. \nSo, a total of 19 * 42 = 798 microwaves were sold.\nIn the next 10 months, an average of 20 microwave ovens were sold per month. \nThus, a total of 10 * 20 = 200 microwaves were sold.\nIn the total 22 months, 798 + 200 = 998 microwaves were sold.\nTo find the average number of sales per month, divide the total number of microwaves sold (998) by the number of months (22). \n998 / 22 = 45.36, which rounds to 45.\nThe average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 45.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question: Calculate the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over a 22-month period.\n2. Identify the given values: \n   - Average sales for the first 13 months = 42 microwaves/month\n   - Average sales for the next 10 months = 20 microwaves/month\n3. Calculate the total number of microwaves sold in the first 13 months (step-by-step multiplication).\n4. Calculate the total number of microwaves sold in the next 10 months (step-by-step multiplication).\n5. Find the total number of microwaves sold in the entire 22-month period (sum of the previous two results).\n6. Calculate the average by dividing the total number of microwaves sold by the number of months (22). \n7. Check your calculations and ensure you are performing multiplication and division correctly.\n8. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the question carefully and identify the specific values given.\n- Understand the concept of averages and how they relate to the given data.\n- Perform calculations step-by-step to avoid errors and ensure accuracy.\n- Double-check your calculations and the final answer.\n- Ensure you are performing the correct mathematical operations for the given question.\n"
