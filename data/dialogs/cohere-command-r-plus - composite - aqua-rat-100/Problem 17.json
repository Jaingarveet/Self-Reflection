What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Division error\n- Incorrect variable\n\nSolution:\n\nThe company produces 420 units of the component monthly, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5040 components. \n\nTo make a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must exceed the production costs by this amount. \n\nTotal production costs are 5040 * $110 = $554,400 \n\nSo, the total sales revenue required is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800 \n\nNow, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: \n\n$1,180,800 / 420 = $[REDACTED]0 / 9 = $311.11 (rounded to the nearest cent) \n\nSo, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given information: monthly production, monthly production cost, and the required yearly profit. \n2. Calculate the total number of components produced in a year. \n3. Determine the total sales revenue required to achieve the desired profit. \n4. Calculate the minimum selling price per component by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of components produced monthly. \n5. Ensure that you are dividing by the correct number (in this case, the monthly production, not the yearly production). \n6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result. \n\nAdvice:\n - Read the question carefully and identify the given information. \n - Pay attention to the units and ensure you are performing calculations with consistent units. \n - Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are dividing by the correct number. \n - Always consider the context of the problem and whether your answer makes sense within that context. \n - Practice similar problems to improve your calculation accuracy and familiarity with the concepts.\n"
