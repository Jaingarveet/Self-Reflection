Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

I incorrectly chose answer B, thinking that Mahr must work in Zone 1.\n\nHowever, upon further review, I realized that the given conditions do not provide enough information to determine the sales representatives' zones. In particular, we cannot infer the zone of Mahr or Stuckey based on the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2, as this statement is not ruled out by the given conditions.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the other choices:\n\nA. Kim works in Zone 2: This choice is incorrect because we cannot determine Kim's zone based on the given conditions.\n\nB. Mahr works in Zone 1: This choice is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, we cannot determine Mahr's zone based on the given conditions.\n\nC. Parra works in Zone 3: This choice is incorrect because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and we know that Quinn works in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.\n\nE. Tiao works in Zone 1: This choice is incorrect because Tiao could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, and we cannot determine Tiao's zone based on the given conditions.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is (D) Stuckey works in Zone 2, as it is the only statement that is not ruled out by the given conditions."
