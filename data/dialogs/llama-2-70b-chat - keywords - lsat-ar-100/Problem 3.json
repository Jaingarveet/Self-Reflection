Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Insufficient information\n - Overlooked possibility\n"

I overlooked the possibility that Souza could be assigned parking space #5, which would satisfy all the rules given in the problem.\n\nNow, let's re-evaluate the question:\nIf Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then we know that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned either #1, #2, or #4.\n\nSince Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, Souza must be assigned either #4 or #5. If Souza is assigned #4, then Xu must be assigned #6, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Souza must be assigned #5.\n\nNow, we can see that the correct answer is choice A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
