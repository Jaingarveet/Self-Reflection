The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misconception\n* Flawed reasoning\n* Insufficient consideration of possibilities\n"

After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that my mistake was due to a misconception and flawed reasoning. I did not consider all the possibilities carefully, which led me to an incorrect answer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question again:\nIf exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\n\nA: Megregian does not review Undulation.\nB: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\nC: Jiang reviews Undulation.\nD: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\nE: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, we can deduce that Megregian, who reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, must review Sunset.\n\nNow, let's consider the three students who review Undulation. If Megregian does not review Undulation, then we have two students left, O'Neill and Jiang. Since Lopez does not review Undulation, Jiang must be one of the three students who review Undulation. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
