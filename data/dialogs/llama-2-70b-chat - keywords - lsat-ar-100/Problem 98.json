K cannot be shown in the morning, so it cannot be shown after J, which is shown in the evening.\n\nB: L is shown at some time after J is shown. - This option is possible. L must be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning. So, L could be shown in the afternoon or evening, after K.\n\nC: P is shown at some time after J is shown. - This option is also possible. P could be shown in the afternoon or evening, after J.\n\nD: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. - This option is not possible. M is shown in the afternoon, and N and O cannot be shown before M. Therefore, they cannot be shown after M.\n\nE: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. - This option is not possible. K cannot be shown in the morning, so N and P cannot be shown after K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
