After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the conditions and incorrect application of logic.\n\nThe question asks about the necessary conditions for both G and H to be selected. Let's analyze the given choices:\n\nA: F or else K - This choice is incorrect because if F is selected, then K cannot be selected due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.\n\nB: F or else M - This choice is incorrect for the same reason as A.\n\nC: K or else M - This choice is correct. If K is selected, then M must be selected due to the condition that if K is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\n\nD: M or else Q - This choice is incorrect because even if M is selected, Q does not have to be selected.\n\nE: P or else Q - This choice is incorrect because even if P is selected, Q does not have to be selected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: K or else M.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
