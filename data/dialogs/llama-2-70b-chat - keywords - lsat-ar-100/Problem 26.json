Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.

Wayne performs a modern piece in the first or fifth solo. Wayne cannot perform a traditional piece in the third solo, as it is already assigned to Zara. Therefore, the earliest Wayne can perform a traditional piece is in the fourth solo.\nThe minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is two.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
