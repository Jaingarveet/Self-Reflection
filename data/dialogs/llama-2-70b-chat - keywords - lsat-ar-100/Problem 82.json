Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

I misunderstood the condition that \"Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\" I thought it meant that both Parra and Tiao could work in Zone 1, which led to my incorrect answer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the choices again:\n\nA: This choice violates the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n\nB: This choice violates the condition that Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n\nC: This choice satisfies all the given conditions. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other (Zone 3), and Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 (Tiao works in Zone 1).\n\nD: This choice violates the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n\nE: This choice violates the condition that There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
