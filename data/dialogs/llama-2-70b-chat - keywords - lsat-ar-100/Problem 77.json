Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space.

Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Oversight\n* Misinterpretation of rules\n* Insufficient consideration of constraints\n"

Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nWith these rules in mind, we can deduce that the only possible parking spaces for Young are #5 and #6, since Robertson must have a lower number than Young, and Xu must have a lower number than Souza. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces for Young is limited to two possible spaces.\nSimilarly, the only possible parking spaces for Xu are #4 and #5, since Xu must have a higher number than Souza, and Young must have a higher number than Togowa. Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces for Xu is also limited to two possible spaces.\nNo other employee has such a limitation, as Robertson, Souza, Togowa, and Vaughn can be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces.\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) two.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
