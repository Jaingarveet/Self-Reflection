Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the problem\n* Lack of attention to detail\n* Failure to carefully evaluate the given constraints\n"

Let's analyze the problem again carefully.\nThe problem states that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, we can conclude that Young must be assigned a parking space higher than #4, since Togowa cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4.\nAdditionally, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Robertson must be assigned a parking space higher than #4.\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\nThis is not possible since Togowa cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4.\n\nB: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nThis is possible, but it would violate the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n\nC: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\nThis is possible and consistent with the rules given.\n\nD: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\nThis is not possible since Souza must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Xu, and Xu cannot be assigned a parking space lower than #3.\n\nE: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\nThis is not possible since Vaughn cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4, and Robertson must be assigned a parking space higher than #4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
