I thought that Kevin and Rebecca had to lead sessions on the same day, but it's actually Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n\nHere's my revised answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\nIf Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then we know that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Olivia's session cannot meet on Wednesday morning, which means that Lan's session cannot meet on Wednesday morning either, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.\n\nTherefore, the only option that could be true EXCEPT is:\n\nD: Olivia's session meets Thursday morning.\n\nSince Olivia's session cannot meet on Wednesday morning, it must meet on Thursday or Friday. However, since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Olivia's session must meet in the morning. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if I have made any mistakes."
