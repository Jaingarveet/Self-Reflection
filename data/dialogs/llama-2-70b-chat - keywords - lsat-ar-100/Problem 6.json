The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

Specifically, I mistakenly assumed that Jiang reviewed more plays than Lopez, which led me to choose answer A.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the information provided actually implies that Lopez reviews fewer plays than Jiang. Therefore, answer A is actually incorrect.\n\nFurthermore, I realized that the correct answer must be either B, C, or D, since O'Neill cannot review more plays than Kramer, as they both review Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nMegregian reviews more plays than Lopez, and Lopez does not review any play that Jiang reviews. Therefore, Megregian must review at least one play that Jiang does not, which means Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang.\n\nNote: The error keywords provided are not relevant to this question, as they do not appear in the given information or the correct answer."
