I misunderstood the conditions and incorrectly applied the information given.\n\nThe correct answer is (E) Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must be in Zone 3 together.\n2. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3.\n3. Tiao cannot be in Zone 3 because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and Udall is already in Zone 3.\n4. Kim cannot be in Zone 3 because the condition states that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra is already in Zone 3.\n5. Mahr cannot be in Zone 3 because the only remaining option is Kim, and Kim cannot be in Zone 3.\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
