J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nIf J is third, we can create a possible ordering of the articles:\nS, Q, J, G, R, Y, H\nIn this ordering, condition 1 is met as no consecutive articles cover the same topic.\nCondition 2 is also met, as S is earlier than Q, and Q is third.\nCondition 3 is satisfied, as S is earlier than Y.\nCondition 4 is fulfilled, as J is earlier than G, and G is earlier than R.\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\nA: G is fourth - This is incorrect, as G must be earlier than R, and R is fourth in this ordering.\nB: His sixth - This is incorrect, as there is no information about the sixth article.\nC: Q is first - This is incorrect, as Q cannot be first, as S must be earlier than Q.\nD: S is second - This is incorrect, as S must be earlier than Y, and Y is fifth in this ordering.\nE: Y is fifth - This is correct! In the possible ordering above, Y is indeed fifth.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: Y is fifth.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
