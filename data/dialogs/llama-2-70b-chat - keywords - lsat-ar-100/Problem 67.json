The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\n  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.\n  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.\n  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of conditions\n* Lack of attention to detail\n* Incorrect inference\n"

I misunderstood the conditions and made an incorrect inference.\nHere's my reflection on the problem, my previous solution, and the correct answer:\n\nThe problem states that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, it's not possible for all three batches of the same kind of cookie to be made on the same day.\n\nMy previous solution was choice A, \"Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\" However, this is incorrect because it violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n\nThe correct answer is choice B, \"Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\" This satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
