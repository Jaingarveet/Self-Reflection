The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

Please let me know if I need to revise my response."
