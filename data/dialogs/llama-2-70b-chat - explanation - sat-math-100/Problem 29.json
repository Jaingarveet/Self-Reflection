To find the planet where the same object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons, we can use the formula $W=mg$. We need to find the planet where $g$ is such that $W=170$.\nWe can start by looking at the chart and identifying the planets where the acceleration due to gravity is greater than 10 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$. These planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\nWe can eliminate Jupiter because the acceleration due to gravity is too high, 26.0 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$, and the weight of the object would be too great.\nWe can also eliminate Neptune because the acceleration due to gravity is 14.1 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$, which is still too high.\nBetween Saturn and Uranus, Saturn has a slightly higher acceleration due to gravity, 11.1 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$, compared to Uranus' 10.7 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$. Therefore, the object would have a slightly higher weight on Saturn.\nSo, the planet where the same object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons is Saturn.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
