I reasoned that $2 x\\left(x^{2}-3 x\\right)$ was equivalent to $2 x^{3} - 6 x^{2}$, which is equal to $-4 x^{2}$ when simplified.\n\nHowever, upon further review, I realized that my answer was incorrect. I made a mistake in my calculation, and I didn't properly simplify the expression.\n\nThe correct answer is actually C: $2 x^{3}-3 x$. To see why, we can rewrite the given expression as $2 x\\left(x^{2}-3 x\\right) = 2 x^{3} - 6 x^{2} + 3 x$. Then, we can simplify this expression by combining like terms: $2 x^{3} - 6 x^{2} + 3 x = 2 x^{3} - 3 x$. Therefore, the equivalent expression is $2 x^{3}-3 x$.\n\nSo, my mistake was that I incorrectly simplified the expression. I mistakenly added $6 x^{2}$ and $3 x$ instead of subtracting them. This mistake led me to choose the wrong answer.\n\nNow that I've reflected on my mistake, I'm confident that I can correctly answer the question. Here's my revised answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
