Let's try again.\nIf $a^{2} + b^{2} = z$ and $ab = y$, we can start by expanding the first equation:\n$a^{2} + b^{2} = (a + b)(a - b)$\nWe can then substitute $ab = y$ into the equation:\n$(a + b)(a - b) = z$\nNow, we can factor out a common factor of $a$ from both terms:\n$(a + b)a - (a - b)b = z$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$2ab = z$\nNow, we can substitute $ab = y$ again:\n$2y = z$\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n$y = (z/2)$\nNow, we can compare this expression to the choices:\nChoice A: $(a+2b)^{2}$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$(a + 2b)^{2} = a^{2} + 4ab + 4b^{2}$\nSubstituting $ab = y$, we get:\n$(a + 2b)^{2} = a^{2} + 4y + 4b^{2}$\nThis is not equivalent to $4z + 8y$.\nChoice B: $(2a+2b)^{2}$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$(2a + 2b)^{2} = 4a^{2} + 8ab + 4b^{2}$\nSubstituting $ab = y$, we get:\n$(2a + 2b)^{2} = 4a^{2} + 8y + 4b^{2}$\nThis is not equivalent to $4z + 8y$.\nChoice C: $(4a+4b)^{2}$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$(4a + 4b)^{2} = 16a^{2} + 16ab + 16b^{2}$\nSubstituting $ab = y$, we get:\n$(4a + 4b)^{2} = 16a^{2} + 16y + 16b^{2}$\nThis is not equivalent to $4z + 8y$.\nChoice D: $(4a+8b)^{2}$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$(4a + 8b)^{2} = 16a^{2} + 32ab + 64b^{2}$\nSubstituting $ab = y$, we get:\n$(4a + 8b)^{2} = 16a^{2} + 32y + 64b^{2}$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$(4a + 8b)^{2} = 16(a^{2} + 2y + 4b^{2})$\nThis is equivalent to $4z + 8y$.\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice D: $(4a+8b)^{2}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
