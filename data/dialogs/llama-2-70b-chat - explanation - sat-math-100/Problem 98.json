This time, I will solve it by elimination.\n\nThe first equation is 3x + 4y = -23.\nThe second equation is 2y - x = -19.\n\nMultiplying the first equation by 2 and adding it to the second equation, we get:\n\n6x + 8y = -46\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y:\n\n6x = -46 - 8y\n\nx = -46/6 - 8y/6\n\nx = -7 - 8y/6\n\nNow, substituting x into one of the original equations, we can solve for y:\n\n3(-7 - 8y/6) + 4y = -23\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n-21 - 24y/6 + 4y = -23\n\n-24y/6 = -4\n\ny = 6\n\nNow, substituting y into x = -7 - 8y/6, we get:\n\nx = -7 - 8(6)/6\n\nx = -7 - 48/6\n\nx = -7 - 8\n\nx = -15\n\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is (x, y) = (-15, 6).\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
