To find when the ball will hit the ground, we need to find when the height is equal to zero.\n\nSetting h = 0 and substituting the given equation, we get:\n\n0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt^2 = 25/4.9\n\nt^2 = 5\n\nt = sqrt(5)\n\nt â‰ˆ 2.236\n\nSince the question asks for the approximate time, we can round up to 2.3 seconds.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
