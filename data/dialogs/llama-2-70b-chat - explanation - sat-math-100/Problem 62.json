Using the sample data, the researcher estimated that $23 \\%$ of the students in the population saw a movie at least once per month. The margin of error for this estimation is $4 \\%$. Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion about all students at the university, based on the given estimate and margin of error?\nChoices:\n  A: It is unlikely that less than $23 \\%$ of the students see a movie at least once per month.\n  B: At least 23\\%, but no more than $25 \\%$, of the students see a movie at least once per month.\n  C: The researcher is between $19 \\%$ and $27 \\%$ sure that most students see a movie at least once per month.\n  D: It is plausible that the percentage of students who see a movie at least once per month is between $19 \\%$ and $27 \\%$.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered choice [REDACTED], but the correct answer is [REDACTED].\nI misunderstood the wording of the choices and selected the wrong one.\nThe correct answer, [REDACTED], states that it is plausible that the percentage of students who see a movie at least once per month is between $19 \\%$ and $27 \\%$.\nThis is consistent with the given information, including the estimated percentage and margin of error.\n"
