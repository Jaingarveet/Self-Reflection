The equation given in the question is:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - 4 = 9x - 6$$\n\nI misunderstood the question and solved for the value of $x$ instead of $3x - 2$.\n\nTo solve for $3x - 2$, we need to first simplify the given equation:\n\n$$\\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - 4 = 9x - 6$$\n\n$$\\frac{2}{3}(9x) - \\frac{2}{3}(6) - 4 = 9x - 6$$\n\n$$6x - \\frac{4}{3} - 4 = 9x - 6$$\n\n$$6x - \\frac{4}{3} - 10 = 9x - 6$$\n\n$$3x - \\frac{4}{3} = 3$$\n\n$$3x = \\frac{4}{3} + 3$$\n\n$$3x = \\frac{7}{3}$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $3x - 2$ is:\n\n$$3x - 2 = \\frac{7}{3} - 2 = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is choice C: $-\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nI hope this answer is correct, and I appreciate any feedback that can help me improve my understanding and accuracy."
