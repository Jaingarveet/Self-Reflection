        "content": "  My apologies for my previous response. Let's break down the problem step by step:\nAlan's weekly gasoline expenditure can be calculated as follows:\nWeekly gasoline expenditure = Total miles driven × Gas price\nWeekly gasoline expenditure = 100 miles/week × $4/gallon = $400/week\nAlan wants to reduce his weekly gasoline expenditure by $5, so he needs to reduce his total weekly miles driven by:\nReduction in weekly miles = Weekly gasoline expenditure ÷ Gas price\nReduction in weekly miles = $5 ÷ $4/gallon = 1.25 gallons\nSince Alan's car can travel 25 miles per gallon, he needs to reduce his weekly miles driven by:\nReduction in weekly miles = 1.25 gallons × 25 miles/gallon = 31.25 miles/week\nTherefore, the equation Alan can use to determine how many fewer average miles, m, he should drive each week is:\n25/4 m = 31.25\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
