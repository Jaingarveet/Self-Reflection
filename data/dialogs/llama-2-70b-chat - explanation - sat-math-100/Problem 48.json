Let's analyze the given equations:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n3x + b &= 5x - 7 \\\\\n3y + c &= 5y - 7\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWe can observe that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ are the same, and the constant terms are the same. This indicates that we can set up a proportionality relationship between the two equations:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n3x + b &= 5x - 7 \\\\\n3y + c &= 5y - 7\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow, we are given that $b$ is $c$ minus $\\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$3x + (c - \\frac{1}{2}) = 5x - 7$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$3x + c - \\frac{1}{2} = 5x - 7$$\n\nNow, we can equate the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ by substituting $y = x + \\frac{1}{2}$:\n\n$$3(x + \\frac{1}{2}) + c - \\frac{1}{2} = 5(x + \\frac{1}{2}) - 7$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$3x + 3\\frac{1}{2} + c - \\frac{1}{2} = 5x + 5\\frac{1}{2} - 7$$\n\nComparing the coefficients of $x$ and $y$, we get:\n\n$$3x = 5x - 3\\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$x = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNow, substituting $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the first equation, we get:\n\n$$3\\frac{1}{2} + b = 5\\frac{1}{2} - 7$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$b = \\frac{1}{2} - 7$$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
