A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?\nChoices:\n  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store\n  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected\n  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees\n  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of sampling and its relation to the population.\nI thought that option [REDACTED] was the best choice because it seemed to be the most straightforward method to gather information from a single store and generalize it to the entire population.\nHowever, I realize now that this method is not appropriate because it only provides information about one store, and we cannot generalize the results to the entire population.\n"
