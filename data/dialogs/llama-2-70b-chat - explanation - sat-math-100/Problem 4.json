I mistakenly substituted (2, k) into the equation of the line instead of (k, 32). This led me to conclude that k = 32, which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is k = 4. The line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) passes through the origin, so we can write:\n\n2 + k = 0\nk + 32 = 0\n\nSolving the system of equations, we get:\n\n2 + k = 0\nk + 32 = 0\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides of the first equation, we get:\n\nk = -2\n\nSubtracting 32 from both sides of the second equation, we get:\n\nk = -32\n\nSince k cannot be negative, the only possible value of k is 4. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 4."
