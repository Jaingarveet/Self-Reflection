Let's break down the problem step by step:\nThe original price of the laptop is $p$ dollars.\nThe store gives a 20% discount, so the discounted price is $p \\times 0.8 = 0.8p$ dollars.\nThe sales tax is 8% of the discounted price, which is $0.08 \\times 0.8p = 0.064p$ dollars.\nThe total amount Alma paid to the cashier is the sum of the discounted price and the sales tax: $0.8p + 0.064p = 0.864p$ dollars.\nNow, we can set up an equation to represent the original price of the laptop in terms of the amount Alma paid:\n$p = \\frac{0.864p}{1.08}$\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$p = \\frac{0.864}{1.08}p$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
