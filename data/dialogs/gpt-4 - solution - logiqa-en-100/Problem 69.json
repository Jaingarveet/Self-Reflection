This is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. Therefore, any assumption that does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses would not necessarily make the inference hold. The assumption that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's (Choice A) does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses, and therefore does not necessarily make the inference hold.\n"
