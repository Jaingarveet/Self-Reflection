Read the question carefully and identify the phenomenon that needs to be explained.\n2. Consider the relationship between traffic volume and speed.\n3.

I assumed that high traffic volume would lead to more accidents, but I did not consider that high traffic volume can also lead to slower speeds, which can reduce the severity of accidents.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe phenomenon that needs to be explained is that highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents. The relationship between traffic volume and speed is important because high traffic volume can lead to slower speeds, which can reduce the severity of accidents.\n\nAnswer choice A is not relevant to the phenomenon described because it does not explain why highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.\n\nAnswer choice B is not relevant to the phenomenon described because it does not explain why highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.\n\nAnswer choice C is the best answer because it suggests that most motorists on heavily traveled highways are commuting to or from work, which means they are likely driving at slower speeds and are more familiar with the road, reducing the likelihood of fatal accidents.\n\nAnswer choice D is not relevant to the phenomenon described because it does not explain why highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.\n\nAnswer choice E is not relevant to the phenomenon described because it does not explain why highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents."
