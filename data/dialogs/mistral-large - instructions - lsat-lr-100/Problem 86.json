        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to understand what it is asking.\n2. Identify the key information provided in the context.\n3. Consider how this information relates to each of the answer choices.\n4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly supported by the information provided.\n5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information provided.\n"
