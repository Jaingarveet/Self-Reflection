Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.\n  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.\n  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.\n  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.\n  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the reasoning behind the original statement.\n2. Compare the reasoning in each answer choice to the reasoning in the original statement.\n3. Identify the answer choice that presents a similar reasoning to the original statement.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is based on the reasoning, not just the difference between the options.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your identified reasoning.\n"

The reasoning behind the original statement is that when presented with two equally desirable and unfamiliar options, the person will choose the more expensive one.\n2.

When presented with two options, the person chooses one, making it unlikely they would choose the other.\nC.
