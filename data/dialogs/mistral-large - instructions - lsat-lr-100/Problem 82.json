Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the argument and the objection.\n2. Determine what Patricia needs to show to counter Tamara's objection.\n3. Evaluate each choice to determine which one best supports Patricia's argument.\n4. Work step-by-step through your reasoning.\n5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that best supports Patricia's argument.\n"

Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\n3. To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the squeaky floors were not necessarily a response to the fear of ninjas.\n4. Evaluating each choice:\nA: This choice does not support Patricia's argument because it does not address the fear of ninjas.\nB: This choice supports Patricia's argument because it suggests that the squeaky floors were not an effective deterrent against ninjas, and therefore, not necessarily a response to the fear of ninjas.\nC: This choice does not support Patricia's argument because it does not address the fear of ninjas.\nD: This choice does not support Patricia's argument because it does not address the fear of ninjas during the Tokugawa period.\nE: This choice does not support Patricia's argument because it does not address the fear of ninjas during the Tokugawa period.\n5. Double-checking my reasoning, I can confirm that choice B is the best counter to Tamara's objection.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
