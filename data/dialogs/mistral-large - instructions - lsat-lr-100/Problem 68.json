However, this assumption could be false if cocker spaniels are more likely to stray from their owners than other breeds, or if there are more stray dogs found in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing option B, which is not relevant to evaluating the assumption. The correct answer is option C, which provides information about the number of stray dogs found in and around Flynn Heights compared to other parts of the city. This information is relevant to evaluating the assumption that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights."
