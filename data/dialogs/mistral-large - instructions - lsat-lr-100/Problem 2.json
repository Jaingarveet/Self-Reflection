It does not provide any information about the total number of Canadian films produced this year, the number of Canadian films shown at international film festivals, or the number of films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nWe can infer that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films since only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. However, we cannot infer anything about the proportion of Canadian films that won prizes at international film festivals or the proportion of Canadian films that were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the given statements. I assumed that most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival, which is not stated in the given statements.\n\nTo avoid making the same mistake, I carefully read the given statements and identified the relationship between the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and the films that won prizes at international film festivals. I considered all possible scenarios and eliminated any answer choices that cannot be inferred from the given statements.
