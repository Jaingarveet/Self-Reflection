        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step to make sure we get the right answer this time:\n1) The company produces 420 components per month. Over a year that is:\n   420 * 12 = 5040 components per year\n2) The production cost is $110 per component. So the total yearly production cost is: \n   5040 * $110 = $554,400\n3) They want a minimum yearly profit of $626,400. \n   So the total revenue must be at least:\n   Minimum Revenue = Production Cost + Minimum Profit\n                    = $554,400 + $626,400 \n                    = $1,180,800\n4) To get the minimum price per component, divide the minimum revenue by total yearly units:\n   Minimum Price = Minimum Revenue / Yearly Units\n                 = $1,180,800 / 5040\n                 = $234.28571...\n   \n5) Rounding up to the nearest integer gives a minimum price of $235 per component.\n6) Looking at the answer choices, $240 is the smallest value that is greater than or equal to $235.\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that guarantees the desired yearly profit is $240.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
