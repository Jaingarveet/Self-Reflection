I correctly calculated that the frog effectively gains 1m per day, but I incorrectly concluded that the frog would reach the top on the 29th day. In reality, the frog needs an extra day to fully escape the well after reaching the 29m mark.\n"

Let me think through this again step-by-step:\n- The well is 30m deep and the frog starts at the bottom\n- Each day the frog jumps up 3m but falls back down 2m \n- So the net gain per day is 3m - 2m = 1m\n- After 29 days, the frog will have climbed 29m, reaching a height of 29m in the 30m well\n- However, the frog still needs one more day to jump the final 1m and get out of the well completely\n- Therefore, it will take the frog a total of 30 days to fully escape the well\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
