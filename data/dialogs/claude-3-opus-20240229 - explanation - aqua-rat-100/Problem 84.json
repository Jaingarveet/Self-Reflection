        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know Susan must be to the left of Tim. This means there are two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim:\n   - Susan, Tim\n   - Susan, [empty chair], Tim\n2. Now for each of those two arrangements, Zen can sit in any of the remaining chairs. So:\n   - If Susan and Tim are next to each other, Zen can sit on either end, giving 2 possibilities.\n   - If there is a chair between Susan and Tim, Zen must sit in that chair, giving 1 possibility.\n3. So in total, there are 2 + 1 = 3 possible arrangements where Susan is to the left of Tim.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: there are 3 ways to arrange the children with Susan to the left of Tim.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
