        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) Let the height of the tower be h and the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.\n2) When the angle of elevation is 45°, we have: tan(45°) = h/x, or x = h (since tan(45°) = 1)\n3) After 10 minutes, the angle of elevation is 60°. Let the distance of the car from the base at this point be y.\n   We have: tan(60°) = h/y, or y = h/√3 (since tan(60°) = √3)\n4) The distance traveled by the car in these 10 minutes is: x - y = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3)\n5) Since the speed is uniform, the time taken to cover the remaining distance y will be:\n   Additional time = y / (distance covered in 10 min) \n                   = (h/√3) / (h(1 - 1/√3) / 10)\n                   = 10/(√3 - 1)\n                   = 10(√3 + 1) / (3 - 1)\n                   = 5(√3 + 1)\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 5(√3 + 1) more minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
