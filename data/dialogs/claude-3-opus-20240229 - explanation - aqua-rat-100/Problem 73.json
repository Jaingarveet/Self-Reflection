I correctly identified that the total number of students must be a multiple of 25 for both the percentage of physics students and math students to be whole numbers. However, I failed to consider the additional constraint that the sum of the percentages of physics and math students should not exceed 100%. If 48% of the students took either physics or math, then the remaining 52% must have taken neither, which is not possible if every student must take at least one of these subjects.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The school has more than 501 students.\n2. 20% of the students took physics. For this to be a whole number of students, the total number of students must be a multiple of 5.\n3. 28% of the students took math. For this to be a whole number of students, the total number of students must be a multiple of 25. (Since 4 x 25 = 100, and 28 is 7/25 of 100).\n4. So the total number of students must be a multiple of 25 greater than 501. The first few such numbers are 525, 550, 575, 600, etc.\n5. However, we also need to ensure that the sum of the percentages of physics and math students does not exceed 100%. Otherwise, it would imply some students took neither subject.\n6. At 550 students:\n   - 20% in physics = 110 students\n   - 28% in math = 154 students\n   - Total in either physics or math = 110 + 154 = 264\n   - Percentage in either physics or math = 264/550 = 48%\n   - This leaves 52% who took neither, which is not possible.\n7. At 575 students:\n   - 20% in physics = 115 students\n   - 28% in math = 161 students \n   - Total in either physics or math = 115 + 161 = 276\n   - Percentage in either physics or math = 276/575 = 48%\n   - Again, this leaves 52% who took neither.\n8. At 600 students:\n   - 20% in physics = 120 students\n   - 28% in math = 168 students\n   - Total in either physics or math = 120 + 168 = 288\n   - Percentage in either physics or math = 288/600 = 48% \n   - Once again, 52% took neither subject.\nTherefore, the least number of students that satisfies all the conditions is 600.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
