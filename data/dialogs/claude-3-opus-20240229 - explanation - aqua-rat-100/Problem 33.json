I correctly calculated the area of the square and the area of the two semicircles that were cut out. However, when subtracting the area of the semicircles from the area of the square, I forgot to convert the result from square centimeters to square meters. This led me to choose an incorrect answer that was off by a factor of 100.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step, being careful with units:\n1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. \n   Area of square = side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2\n2. Two semicircles are cut out, with the sides of the square as their diameters.\n   Radius of each semicircle = 20/2 = 10 cm\n   Area of semicircle = (1/2) * pi * r^2 \n                      = 0.5 * pi * 10^2\n                      = 50pi cm^2\n   \n   Area of two semicircles = 2 * 50pi = 100pi cm^2\n3. Remaining area = Area of square - Area of semicircles\n                  = 400 - 100pi cm^2\n                  = (400 - 100pi) cm^2\n                  â‰ˆ 85.84 cm^2\n4. The question asks for the answer in square meters.\n   1 m^2 = 10000 cm^2\n   So, remaining area in m^2 = 85.84 / 10000 = 0.008584 m^2\n5. Looking at the choices, the closest answer is 8.58 x 10^-3 m^2, which is choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
