When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*√72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34.

        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step, keeping in mind the error I made previously with the upper bound calculation.\n1) The expression for x is: x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)\n2) We're told that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. Let's find the lower and upper bounds for x.\n3) For the lower bound, substitute n = 36:\n   x = (36^2 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)\n     = (1296 + 480 + 16) / (36 + 24 + 4)\n     = 1792 / 64\n     = 28\n4) For the upper bound, substitute n = 72 (and this time, calculate 4√72 carefully):\n   x = (72^2 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)\n     = (5184 + 2√72*76 + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)\n     = (5184 + 1292.82... + 16) / (72 + 33.94... + 4)  [Note: 4√72 ≈ 33.94, not 34]\n     = 6492.82... / 109.94...\n     ≈ 59.08\n5) So the bounds are: 28 < x < 59.08 (approximately)\nLooking at the choices, the one that best matches this range is:\nD: 28 < x < 60\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
