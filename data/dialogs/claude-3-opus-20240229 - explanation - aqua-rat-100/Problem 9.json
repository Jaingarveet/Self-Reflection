If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 16\n  C: 24\n  D: 30\n  E: 40\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my calculation of the number of bags sold. I divided the total profit by the profit per bag, but this is incorrect because the profit per bag was calculated as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost price. To find the number of bags sold, I should have divided the total profit by the profit per bag in dollars, not as a percentage.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the explanation from the reflection:\n1. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.\n2. Each bag is sold for $100.\n3. 25% of $100 is $25. So the profit per bag is $25.\n4. The total profit made is $3,000.\n5. To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag in dollars:\n   * Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag\n   * Number of bags = $3,000 / $25\n   * Number of bags = 120\nLooking at the choices, 120 bags is not an option. The closest number of bags is 120.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
