I incorrectly thought that I needed to divide the total number of permutations by [REDACTED] to account for the repeated letter.

This means there are only 6 distinct letters: P, R, O, B, L, E. \n3) We want to find the number of ways to rearrange these 6 distinct letters into a 7 letter word.\n4) The number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is n!. \n5) Since we have 6 distinct letters, the number of ways to arrange them is 6!.\n6) 6! = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720\nTherefore, the number of ways to rearrange the letters of \"PROBLEC\" into 7 letter words with no repeating letters is 720, which corresponds to 6!.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
