        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the information provided:\n1. Points A, B, C, D lie in order on the circumference of the circle.\n2. Minor arc AC is 160°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means:\n   - Minor arc AB = 160° / 2 = 80°\n   - Minor arc BC = 160° / 2 = 80°\n3. Minor arc BD is 150°. \n4. From the reflection, I know I previously made an error assuming D was on the major arc AC. So D must actually be on the minor arc AC.\n5. To find the measure of minor arc AD, I can subtract minor arc BD from the full circle (360°):\n   - Minor arc AD = 360° - 150° = 210°\nHowever, 210° is not one of the answer choices. The closest is 220°.\nLet me double check my work...\nAha! I made a small error. Minor arc AD should be:\n- Minor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BD\n- Minor arc AD = 80° + 150° = 230°\n230° is not one of the answer choices either. But based on the information given, it is the correct measure of minor arc AD.\nSince I must select one of the given choices, I'll choose the closest answer.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
