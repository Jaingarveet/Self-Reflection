        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that G is on the top shelf, and K must be on a higher shelf than F, K must also be on the top shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf and K is on a higher shelf than F, F and M cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and we already have two books (G and K) on the top shelf, we can only have two books on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. I is on the middle shelf, and since O must be on a higher shelf than L, L must also be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the books on the middle shelf are [REDACTED], and possibly others.\n"
