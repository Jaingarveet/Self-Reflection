I assumed that the glasses were already filled with lemonade, but the text only mentions steaming hot water being poured over lemons in the glasses. I also made a reading comprehension error by not considering the full context of the text. The text mentions stirring the glasses with a stirring rod, which suggests that the lemonade is still being made.\n\nThought:\nThe text mentions steaming hot water being poured over lemons in the glasses, which suggests that the lemonade is still being made. The glasses are then stirred with a stirring rod, which further supports this idea. It is unlikely that the glasses would be filled with ice or vegetables at this stage, as this would dilute or contaminate the lemonade. It is also unlikely that the glasses would be poured into wooden bowls using a sharp knife, as this would be impractical and potentially dangerous.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
