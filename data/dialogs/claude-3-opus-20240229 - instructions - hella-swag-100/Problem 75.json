[step] The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go. Consider stopping caring about your work/colleagues criticism and you might feel more relaxed in the short term.\nChoices:\n  A: Richard templar says in the rules of wealth act as if you don't need the money and people will no longer have power over you. [title] Believe, from deep in your gut, that you can do better.\n  B: But as time goes on, the hard way tends to become ever harder. Stop caring about what others say/look at what they like.\n  C: [substeps] Don't be afraid to look back on and the future. Remind yourself that it is impossible to work your way to the top, but soon you will be jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl.\n  D: Give your notice to somebody who simply deserves it. This is an integral part of the healthy and productive life you lead.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the given text carefully, paying attention to tone, word choice, and formatting clues.\n2. Ask yourself if the advice seems genuine and constructive, or exaggerated and tongue-in-cheek. \n3. Look for a continuation that matches the tone and style of the original text.\n4. Be wary of selecting an answer choice simply because it offers more \"reasonable\" advice, if it doesn't fit the passage.\n5. Consider the author's likely intent - are they sincerely giving advice or satirizing bad advice?\n"

        "content": "You're right, upon further reflection, the original passage seems to be satirizing bad career advice rather than offering genuine tips. A few key clues:\n- The exaggerated, informal language like \"hit bottom\", \"don't care what others say\", \"desperate schoolgirl\" suggests it's not serious guidance.\n- Advising to stop caring about work and colleagues' opinions is the opposite of typical career advice. \n- The formatting with a \"header\", \"title\" and \"steps\" mimics the style of a self-help article but the content is absurd.\nWith that in mind, the best answer choice will likely continue this satirical tone rather than pivoting to earnest advice. Looking at the options again:\nA and D seem to offer more reasonable suggestions that don't fit the over-the-top style. \nB and C maintain the tongue-in-cheek exaggeration, but C goes even further with the ridiculous image of \"jumping from top to bottom like a desperate schoolgirl.\"\nSo based on matching the satirical tone and intent of the original passage, C is the most fitting continuation.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
