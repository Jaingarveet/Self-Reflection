Let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ in both equations equal: $$\\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\\\ -2x+4 y=-38\\end{array}$$Now, subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate $y$: $$5x = 15$$Divide both sides by 5 to solve for $x$: $$x = 3$$Substitute $x = 3$ into the first equation to solve for $y$: $$3(3) + 4y = -23$$ $$9 + 4y = -23$$ $$4y = -32$$ $$y = -8$$Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(3, -8)$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
