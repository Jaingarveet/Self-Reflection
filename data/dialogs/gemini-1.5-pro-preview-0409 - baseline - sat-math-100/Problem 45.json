Let's use (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89):\nm = (21.89 - 16.94) / (10 - 5) = 0.99\nNow we need to find the y-intercept (b). We can plug in one of the points and the slope into the equation f(x) = mx + b and solve for b. Let's use (5, 16.94):\n16.94 = 0.99 * 5 + b\nb = 11.99\nTherefore, the function is f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
