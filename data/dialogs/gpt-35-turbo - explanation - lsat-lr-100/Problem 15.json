However, upon reviewing the question and the options, it appears that the correct answer is B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true. Morgenstern's argument assumes that the only risk in quitting a job is not finding another one, which is not necessarily true. There may be other risks involved, such as financial instability or difficulty finding a job in a particular field. Therefore, the argument is flawed in that it relies on an assumption that is not necessarily true."
