However, it is not directly related to the phenomenon described in the question. \nChoice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it provides a direct explanation for the phenomenon. If most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed, then it makes sense that highways with the most traffic, which tend to have slower-moving traffic, would have a lower rate of fatal accidents.\n"
