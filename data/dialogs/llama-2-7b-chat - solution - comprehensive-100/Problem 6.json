Let me re-evaluate the problem using the correct method.\n\nThe midpoint of the line segment ST is U, and the length of the line segment RU is needed. We can find the length of RU by using the formula:\n\nLength of RU = (1/2) × (distance between R and U)\n\nWe know that U is the midpoint of ST, so the distance between R and U is half of the length of ST.\n\nLength of ST = 22\n\nSo, the distance between R and U = 22/2 = 11\n\nLength of RU = (1/2) × 11 = 5.5\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
