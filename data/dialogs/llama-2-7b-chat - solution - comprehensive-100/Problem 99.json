After reflecting on my mistake, I realized that I misunderstood the question and selected an agent that is not actually used in chemical peeling.\n\nThe correct answer is (D) Salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is not an agent used in chemical peeling. The other options, (A) Glycolic acid, (B) Kojic acid, and (C) Phenol, are all agents that are commonly used in chemical peeling.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to better understand the question and provide the correct answer this time."
