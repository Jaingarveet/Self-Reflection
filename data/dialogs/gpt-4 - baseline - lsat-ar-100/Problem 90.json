        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?\nChoices:\n  A: a 1-day website target\n  B: a 2-day voicemail target\n  C: a 2-day website target\n  D: a 3-day voicemail target\n  E: a 3-day website target\n"

This means that Image is the only client that can have a 1-day voicemail target. Therefore, a 1-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one client. However, this option is not given in the choices. \nThe other condition that can help us answer the question is that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that Truvest cannot have a 1-day website target because if it did, Solide would have no shorter target available. Therefore, a 1-day website target cannot be set for more than one client. \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
