Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?\nChoices:\n  A: grain\n  B: livestock\n  C: machinery\n  D: produce\n  E: textiles\n"

Livestock is held in a bay with a higher number than Textiles.\n3. Produce is held in a bay with a higher number than Fuel.\n4. Textiles is next to Produce.\nFrom these conditions, we can infer that Textiles cannot be in the highest-numbered bay (6), because Livestock and Grain must be in higher-numbered bays than Textiles. Similarly, Livestock cannot be in bay 6 because Grain must be in a higher-numbered bay. Therefore, Grain could be in bay 6, and Livestock could be in bay 5. \nSince Textiles must be next to Produce, and Produce must be in a higher-numbered bay than Fuel, the lowest possible bay for Produce is bay 3 (with Fuel in bay 2 and Textiles in bay 4). \nTherefore, the only cargo that cannot be in bay 4 is Livestock, because it must be in a higher-numbered bay than Textiles, which could be in bay 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
