Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n"

However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to give reports the next day, Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Monday and Robert on Wednesday. This means that Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because she must give her report the day after Nina. \nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
