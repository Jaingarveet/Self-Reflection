Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?\nChoices:\n  A: one\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n"

The only session left for Lan is Thursday morning. \nSo, we can determine the sessions for four of the other lab assistants: Olivia, Nessa, Kevin, Rebecca, and Lan.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
