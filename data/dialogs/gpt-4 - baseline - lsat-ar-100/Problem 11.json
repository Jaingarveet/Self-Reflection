Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be all of the solos that are traditional pieces?\nChoices:\n  A: the first, third, and fourth\n  B: the second, third, and fourth\n  C: the third and fourth\n  D: the third and fifth\n  E: the fourth and fifth\n"

The first cannot be traditional because Wayne must perform a modern piece before any traditional piece is performed. The second cannot be traditional because the third and fourth are the only consecutive traditional pieces. The fifth cannot be traditional because the performer of the second solo cannot perform the fifth, and the second performer must be Wayne (since he must perform a modern piece before any traditional piece is performed).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
