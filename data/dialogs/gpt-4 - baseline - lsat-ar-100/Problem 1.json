This can be true as it doesn't violate any conditions.\nB: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. This can be true as Franco can testify on Wednesday with Iturbe.\nC: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This can be true as two witnesses are allowed to testify on Tuesday.\nD: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday. This can be true as it doesn't violate any conditions.\nE: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. This cannot be true because if two witnesses testify on Monday and two on Tuesday, then only one can testify on Wednesday. But we know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and at least one other witness (Franco or Garcia) must also testify on Wednesday because they can't testify on the same day. So, this would mean more than five witnesses in total, which is not possible.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
