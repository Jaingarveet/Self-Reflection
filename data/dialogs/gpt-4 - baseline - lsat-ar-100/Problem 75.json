The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\n"

Therefore, the only possible answer is Lopez.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
