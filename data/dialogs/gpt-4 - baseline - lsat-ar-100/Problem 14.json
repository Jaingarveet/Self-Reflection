This satisfies the first condition. \nSince T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, there are four compositions before T and F, and two compositions after them. This satisfies the second condition. \nO cannot be performed fifth because T is performed fifth, so O must be performed first. This satisfies the third condition. \nThe eighth composition can be either L or H, this doesn't affect S's position. \nP is performed at some time before S, so S cannot be performed first, second, third, or fourth because P must be performed before it and O is already performed first. \nAt least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed first, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. So, S cannot be performed second. \nTherefore, S must be performed either seventh or eighth. But since the eighth composition is either L or H, S must be performed seventh. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
