The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\n"

This means Jiang must review Undulation and/or Sunset. Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, it's possible that Megregian reviews all three plays, including Undulation. This would mean that the three students who review Undulation could be Jiang, Megregian, and one other student. \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
