Both a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum have a definite volume, meaning they occupy a specific volume of space. This property is common to both samples, regardless of their size or state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: a definite volume.\n\nReflection:\nAfter reflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I misunderstood the term \"sample\" and confused it with the number of atoms in a substance. This time, I carefully read the question, understood the term \"sample,\" and focused on the physical properties of the two samples. I analyzed the properties of a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum and determined that both have a definite volume. I double-checked my answer by reviewing the properties of the samples in question and made sure it was correct."
