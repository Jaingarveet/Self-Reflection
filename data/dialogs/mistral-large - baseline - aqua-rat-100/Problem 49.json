During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?\nChoices:\n  A: 300\n  B: 500\n  C: 5000\n  D: 6000\n  E: 7500\n"
