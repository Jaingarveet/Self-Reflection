The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is 10 centimeters.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of revolutions in 30 seconds. Since the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, in 30 seconds (which is half a minute), it will make 300/2 = 150 revolutions.\n\nThe distance traveled by the point in one revolution is the circumference of the circle, which is 2π(10) = 20π centimeters.\n\nSince the fan makes 150 revolutions in 30 seconds, the total distance traveled by the point is 150 * 20π = 3000π centimeters.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
