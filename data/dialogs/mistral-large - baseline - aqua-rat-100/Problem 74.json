Choose 3 vertices and the center (F)\n2. Choose 2 vertices, the center (F), and one of the remaining vertices.\n\nFor case 1, we have 5 choose 3 ways to select the vertices, which is 10 ways.\nFor case 2, we have 5 choose 2 ways to select the first two vertices, which is 10 ways. Then, we have 3 remaining vertices to choose from, so we have 3 ways to select the last vertex. Therefore, we have 10 * 3 = 30 ways for case 2.\n\nHowever, we have overcounted the quadrilaterals that include the center and two adjacent vertices, which would form a triangle instead of a quadrilateral. There are 5 such cases, one for each vertex.\n\nSo, the total number of quadrilaterals is 10 (case 1) + 30 (case 2) - 5 (overcounted) = 35.\n\nBut none of the choices match this answer. There must be a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet's reconsider case 2. We have 5 choose 2 ways to select the first two vertices, which is 10 ways. But we don't have 3 ways to select the last vertex. Instead, we have 2 ways to select one of the remaining non-adjacent vertices. Therefore, we have 10 * 2 = 20 ways for case 2.\n\nSo, the total number of quadrilaterals is 10 (case 1) + 20 (case 2) - 5 (overcounted) = 25.\n\nBut none of the choices match this answer either. There must be another mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet's reconsider the overcounting. We only overcount the quadrilaterals that include the center and two adjacent vertices. But in case 2, we are not choosing two adjacent vertices, so there is no overcounting.\n\nSo, the total number of quadrilaterals is 10 (case 1) + 20 (case 2) = 30.\n\nBut none of the choices match this answer either. There must be a mistake in the question or the choices.\n\nAction: Cannot answer as none of the choices match the correct answer."
