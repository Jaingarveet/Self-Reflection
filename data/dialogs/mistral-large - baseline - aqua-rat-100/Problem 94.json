It seems that the question may be asking for the number of distinct letters needed to form these combinations, rather than the total number of combinations.\n\nSince we are using 2 letters for each bike number, and there are 26 possible letters, we only need 2 distinct letters to form all possible combinations.\n\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\nNote: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The correct answer is \"None of the Above\" since the question is asking for the number of distinct letters needed to form the combinations, rather than the total number of combinations."
