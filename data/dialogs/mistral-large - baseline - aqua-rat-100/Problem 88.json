Since the train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours, the total distance is 100 \\* 10 = 1000 miles.\n\nNext, let's calculate the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance. Since the first quarter of the distance is 1000/4 = 250 miles, and the train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, it takes 250/100 = 2.5 hours to cover the first quarter of the distance.\n\nAfter covering the first quarter of the distance, the train slows down to a speed of 75 miles/hour. The remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. At a speed of 75 miles/hour, it takes 750/75 = 10 hours to cover the remaining distance.\n\nTherefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
