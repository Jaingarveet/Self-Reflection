Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Exactly one witness is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that Iturbe and Jackson are both testifying on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one day, Monday, for the remaining three witnesses: Franco, Garcia, and Hong. Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, either Franco or Garcia must testify on Monday, but not both, because they cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, exactly one witness must testify on Monday.\n"
