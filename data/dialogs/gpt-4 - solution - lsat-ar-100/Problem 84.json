        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe conditions state that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, meaning there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. However, this does not mean that there cannot be two books on the bottom shelf if there is only one book on the top shelf. Therefore, options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] should not be eliminated based on this condition.\nThe conditions also state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option [REDACTED] can be eliminated. \nThe conditions also state that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option [REDACTED] can be eliminated. \nThis leaves options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] as possible answers. However, option [REDACTED] can be eliminated because it includes four books, and there are only three shelves, with at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED].\n"
