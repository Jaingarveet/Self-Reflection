Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that bay 4 is holding produce, and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, then fuel must be in one of the bays numbered 1, 2, or 3. \nThe bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5. However, since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, textiles cannot be in bay 5. Therefore, textiles must be in bay 3.\nSince textiles are in bay 3, livestock must be in bay 5. \nThe bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain must be in bay 6. \nSo, the cargo for bays 3 (textiles), 4 (produce), 5 (livestock), and 6 (grain) are completely determined.\n"
