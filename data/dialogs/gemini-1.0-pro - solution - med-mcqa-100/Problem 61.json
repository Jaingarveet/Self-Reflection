I am still under development and learning to improve my accuracy. \nHere's my thought process for this question:\n1. **Newborn seizures**: These are seizures that occur in babies under 28 days old. They are relatively common, affecting about 1-3 out of every 1000 newborns.\n2. **Types of seizures**: There are many different types of seizures, but the most common ones in newborns are:\n    * **Subtle seizures**: These are seizures that are difficult to detect because they involve very small movements or changes in behavior. They are the most common type of seizure in newborns, accounting for about 50% of cases.\n    * **Clonic seizures**: These are seizures that involve rhythmic jerking movements of the limbs or face. They are the second most common type of seizure in newborns, accounting for about 20% of cases.\n    * **Tonic seizures**: These are seizures that involve stiffening of the muscles, usually in the arms and legs. They are less common than subtle and clonic seizures in newborns.\n    * **Myoclonic seizures**: These are seizures that involve brief, shock-like jerks of the muscles. They are also less common than subtle and clonic seizures in newborns.\nBased on this information, the most common type of seizure in newborns is **subtle seizures**.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
