I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the possible causes of an unstable lie.\n* I have learned that an unstable lie can be caused by a variety of factors, including oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumors, and uterine anomalies.\n* I will use this knowledge to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Answer:**\nThe correct answer is **D: Uterine anomalies**.\n**Explanation:**\nUterine anomalies are a common cause of an unstable lie. This is because they can change the shape of the uterus, making it difficult for the baby to find a stable position. Other possible causes of an unstable lie include oligohydramnios, placenta previa, and pelvic tumors. However, these are less common than uterine anomalies.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
