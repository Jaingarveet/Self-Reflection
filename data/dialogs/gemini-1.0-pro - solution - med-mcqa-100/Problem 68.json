I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Thought:**\n* Suxamethonium is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, which means it acts by causing a sustained depolarization of the motor endplate, leading to muscle paralysis.\n* Mivacurium, pancuronium, and vecuronium are non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, which means they act by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the motor endplate, leading to muscle paralysis.\n* Of the non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, mivacurium has the shortest duration of action, followed by vecuronium, and then pancuronium.\n**Answer:**\nBased on the information above, the shortest-acting skeletal muscle relaxant among the options provided is **mivacurium**.\n**Action:**\nAnswer(\"B\")"
