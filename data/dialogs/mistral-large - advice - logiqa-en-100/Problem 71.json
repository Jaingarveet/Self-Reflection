I focused too much on the reasons why people favored college students as nannies, rather than why they would not want to hire them.\n\nAfter reflecting on the problem, I realized that the statement that can reasonably explain the contradiction should provide a reason why people would favor college students as nannies but not want to hire them. I then carefully considered each option and determined that option B was the best answer.\n\nIn the future, I will make sure to carefully read the question and consider all aspects of the problem before answering. I will also make sure to decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step."
