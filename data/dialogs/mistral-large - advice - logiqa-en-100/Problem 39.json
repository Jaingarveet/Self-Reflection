Therefore, it must be type B.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I made assumptions about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes. However, I realized that I needed to consider what the robots were able to do correctly in order to determine their type. I also eliminated answer choices that could not be true based on the information given, such as both robots being type C or one of them being type C. Finally, I double-checked my reasoning and final answer to ensure that it was correct."
