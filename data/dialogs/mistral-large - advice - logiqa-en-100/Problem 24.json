I realized that the fallacy in this statistical reasoning is that it is based on a biased sample. The sample only includes in-service staff who died in a five-year period, which is not representative of the entire population of intellectuals in Zhongguancun. I decomposed the problem into multiple simple steps and thought through each subproblem step-by-step. I double-checked my answer to ensure that it accurately describes the identified fallacy.
