Since M can only participate if F participates, M also cannot participate. Therefore, J must participate since either J or K must participate. If J participates, then G must also participate. So the players are E, J, and G. There is one spot left, which can only be filled by K since M cannot participate.\n2. If F participates, then E cannot participate. M can participate since F participates. Therefore, J must participate since either J or K must participate. If J participates, then G must also participate. So the players are F, J, G, and M.\n\nIn both scenarios, G and J must participate. However, the question asks for two players that must be included in the game. Therefore, we must look for a scenario where G and J are not the only two players that must be included.\n\nIn scenario 1, E, J, G, and K must participate. Therefore, G and K must be included in the game.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
