However, this is not necessarily true, as the absolute increase in land prices could still be significant, even with a small percentage increase.\n\nThought:\nTo doubt the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices, we need to find a choice that shows a small absolute increase in land prices despite a significant increase in housing prices.\n\nChoice A shows a significant increase in housing prices (19.1%) and a moderate increase in land prices (6.53%). However, without knowing the absolute values, we cannot determine if the increase in land prices is small.\n\nChoice B shows a moderate increase in housing prices (7.2%) and a very small increase in land prices (0.37%). This choice is doubtful of the assertion, as it suggests that other factors may be contributing to the increase in housing prices.\n\nChoice C is the opinion of the chairman of Huayuan Real Estate, which supports the assertion that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.\n\nChoice D is the opinion of the chairman of Yongtai Development Company, which suggests that supply and demand are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices, not land prices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
