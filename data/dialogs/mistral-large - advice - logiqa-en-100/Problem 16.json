I realized that I did not carefully read the question and compare each choice to the hypothesis identified in the question. I also assumed that one of the given choices must be correct, which led me to choose an incorrect answer. In the future, I will always carefully read the question and each choice, compare each choice to the hypothesis, and choose \"None of the Above\" if none of the given choices accurately reflects the hypothesis."
