The argument suggests that regulations and the judgment of right and wrong are two separate things, but they can be related. The argument also suggests that regulations can prohibit things that are not inherently wrong and require things that are inherently wrong.\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not carefully evaluate each answer choice in the context of the argument. I chose an answer that suggested a different relationship between regulations and the judgment of right and wrong.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.\" This answer supports the argument by providing additional evidence that regulations and the judgment of right and wrong are related. It suggests that the judgment of right and wrong is based on rules or standards, which can be regulations.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
