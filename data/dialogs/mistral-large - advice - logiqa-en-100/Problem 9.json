If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.\n4. M is at least one of the members of these two groups.\n5. At least one of the same employees in both groups.\n\nNow, let's examine the current composition of the groups:\n\nPrinting group: F, H, L, M\nBinding group: G, H, J\n\nIf K is to replace a member of either group, we must ensure that none of the conditions are violated.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate F as an option (A) because F and K cannot be in the same group (condition 2).\n\nNext, we can eliminate G as an option (B) because K is not in the binding group, so replacing G with K would require J to also be in the binding group (condition 3), which is already the case.\n\nNow, let's consider H as an option (C). If K replaces H in the printing group, J must also be in the printing group (condition 3). However, this would violate condition 5, as there would be no common member between the two groups. Therefore, we cannot replace H with K.\n\nFinally, let's consider L as an option (D). If K replaces L in the printing group, J must also be in the printing group (condition 3). This would result in the printing group having the following members: F, H, J, K, M. This does not violate any conditions, as F and K are not in the same group (condition 2), J is in the same group as K (condition 3), M is still in at least one of the groups (condition 4), and H is the common member between the two groups (condition 5).\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
