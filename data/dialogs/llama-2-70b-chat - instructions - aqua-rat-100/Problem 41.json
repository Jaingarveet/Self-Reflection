I misunderstood the question and calculated the number of friends who attended the picnic instead of the number of friends who were supposed to attend.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n* The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.\n* Four friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.\n* The total number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic = 4 x 4 = 16 (Let's call this variable \"S\").\n* The number of friends who actually attended the picnic = S - 4 (Since four friends did not turn up).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic:\n\nS = 16\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of friends who actually attended the picnic:\n\nActual attendance = S - 4\n= 16 - 4\n= 12\n\nThe answer is B: 12.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
