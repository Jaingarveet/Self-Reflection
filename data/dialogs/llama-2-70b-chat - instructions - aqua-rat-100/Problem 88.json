        "content": "  Sure, I'll do my best to answer the question.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total distance traveled by the train.\nThe question states that the train takes 10 hours to reach its destination, so the total distance traveled by the train is 100 miles/hour x 10 hours = 1000 miles.\n\nStep 2: Identify the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance.\nThe question states that the train covers a quarter of the distance before the rain starts. So, the distance covered before the rain is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles.\nThe time taken to cover this distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour is 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.\n\nStep 3: Identify the time taken to cover the remaining distance.\nThe question states that the train slows down to a speed of 75 miles/hour after the rain starts. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles (1000 miles - 250 miles) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the total journey duration by adding the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance.\nThe total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.\n\nStep 5: Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nI double-checked my calculations, and they seem accurate.\n\nStep 6: Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nThe answer that matches my calculated result is C: 12.5 hours.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
