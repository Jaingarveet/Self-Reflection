I mistakenly calculated the selling price without considering the discount. I realized that the question asks for a discount, and therefore, I need to subtract the discount amount from the selling price.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\nThe cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200/-.\n2. Identify the cost price of the sewing machine.\nThe cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200/-.\n3. Calculate 20% of the cost price.\n20% of Rs. 1200/- is Rs. 240/-.\n4. Add the calculated percentage to the cost price to find the selling price.\nRs. 1200/- + Rs. 240/- = Rs. 1440/-.\n5. Check if the question asks for a profit or a discount.\nThe question asks for a discount.\n6. If the question asks for a discount, subtract the discount amount from the selling price.\nRs. 1440/- - Rs. 240/- = Rs. 1200/-.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nThe correct answer is Rs. 1200/-.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"
