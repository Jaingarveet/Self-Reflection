I mistakenly calculated the number of unpainted faces as 498. However, upon reflection, I realized that my calculation was incorrect.\n\nHere's my corrected solution:\n\n1. The surface area of the outer cube is 6*5^2 = 300 square centimeters.\n2. The number of small cubes on the surface of the outer cube is 6*5^2 = 300.\n3. The total number of faces on the surface of the outer cube is 300*6 = 1800.\n4. The number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted is 1800 - 300 = 1500.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
