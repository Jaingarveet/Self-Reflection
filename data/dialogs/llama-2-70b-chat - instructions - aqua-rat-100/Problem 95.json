I misunderstood the problem and calculated the concentration of milk instead of tea. I also made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nSolution:\nLet's break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. First, John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk. This reduces the concentration of tea to 50 - 15 = 35%.\n2. He replaces 15% of the resultant solution with milk again. Now, the concentration of tea is 35 - 15 = 20%.\n3. Finally, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. The concentration of tea is now 20 - 10 = 10%.\n\nTherefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 10%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
