Understand the problem and identify the relevant information:\nThe depth of the well is 30m, and the frog jumps 3m up and falls back 2m down each day.\n2. Calculate the total movement upward in one day:\nThe net movement upward in one day is 3m - 2m = 1m.\n3. Divide the depth of the well by the total movement upward in one day to find the number of days it will take to come out of the well:\n30m / 1m per day = 30 days.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe correct answer is B: 26 days.\nI should have chosen this answer in my previous response.\nI hope this corrected answer helps me avoid similar mistakes in the future."
