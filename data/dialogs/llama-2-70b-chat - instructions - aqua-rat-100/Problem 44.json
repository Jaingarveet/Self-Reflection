Identify the number of men required to complete the work in 1 day.\n8 men can complete the work in 6 days, so 1 man can complete the work in 6 days.\n2. Divide the number of men by 2 to find the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day.\n1 man can complete the work in 6 days, so 1/2 man can complete the work in 3 days.\n3. Round up the result to the nearest whole number.\n1/2 man rounded up to the nearest whole number is 1 man.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
