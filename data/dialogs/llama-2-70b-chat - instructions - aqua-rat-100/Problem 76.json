Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nPreviously, I answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A.\nUpon reflection, I realized that my mistake was in not carefully evaluating the given choices and their corresponding calculations.\nI learned that it's essential to double-check my work and consider all possible calculations before selecting an answer.\nI also realized that I should have paid closer attention to the given constraints on n (36 ≤ n ≤ 72) and their impact on the calculations.\n\nFor this question, I will carefully evaluate each choice and perform the necessary calculations to determine the correct answer.\nI will also ensure that my calculations are accurate by double-checking my work.\n\nNow, let's proceed to answer the question:\n\n1. The city where Johns Hopkins University is located is Baltimore.\n2. The state where Johns Hopkins University is located is Maryland.\n3. The number of letters in the name of the city (Baltimore) is 8.\n4. The number of letters in the name of the state (Maryland) is 7.\n5. The product of the number of letters in the city and state is 8 x 7 = 56.\n6. Now, we need to calculate the value of x:\nx = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)\nGiven n = 56 (from step 5), we have:\nx = (562 + 2√56(56 + 4) + 16) / (56+ 4√56+ 4)\nx = (3136 + 2√56(60) + 16) / (56+ 4√56+ 4)\nx = (3136 + 128 + 16) / (56+ 4√56+ 4)\nx = 3280 / 60\nx = 54.67\nSince x is a decimal, we round it to the nearest integer.\nRounding up, we get:\nx ≈ 55\n7. Now, let's compare our calculated value of x (55) with the given choices:\nA: 20 < x < 54 (Incorrect - our calculated x = 55 is outside this range)\nB: 23 < x < 58 (Incorrect - our calculated x = 55 is outside this range)\nC: 25 < x < 64 (Incorrect - our calculated x = 55 is outside this range)\nD: 28 < x < 60 (Incorrect - our calculated x = 55 is outside this range)\nE: None of these (Incorrect - our calculated x = 55 does not match any of the given choices)\n\nSince our calculated value of x does not match any of the given choices, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
