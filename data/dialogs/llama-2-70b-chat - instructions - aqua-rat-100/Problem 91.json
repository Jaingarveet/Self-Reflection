Draw a diagram of A's journey:\n\n[Insert diagram of A's journey]\n\n2. Identify the legs of the right triangle formed by A's journey:\nThe legs of the right triangle are 3 km (south), 5 km (east), and 3 km (north).\n\n3. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to 3^2 + 5^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 25 + 9 = 43.\n\n4. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse:\nThe length of the hypotenuse is the square root of 43. Using a calculator, we get:\n\n√43 ≈ 6.5 km\n\n5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length:\nThe answer that matches the calculated length is 6.5 km, which is choice E: 6km.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
