If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then the number of members in the club is:\n\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous response, I made a mistake by not paying attention to the fact that the ages were in arithmetic progression. I incorrectly chose answer C.\n\nTo solve this problem, we know that the youngest member is 7 years old, so the next member's age would be 7 + 3 = 10. The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression is 3 months, so the next member's age would be 10 + 3 = 13. We can continue this pattern to find the ages of the remaining members:\n\n10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70\n\nThe sum of these ages is 250, so we can find the number of members by dividing the sum by the common difference:\n\n250 / 3 = 83\n\nTherefore, the number of members in the club is 83.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
