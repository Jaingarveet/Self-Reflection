If 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team?\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I answered this question incorrectly. I mistakenly calculated the percentage of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team instead of the percentage of students who are members of the swim team.\n\nBreakdown of the problem:\n1. First, we need to find the percentage of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This is given as 24%.\n2. Next, we need to find the percentage of members of the swim team who are not members of the chess club. This is given as 20%.\n3. We then need to use the information from steps 1 and 2 to calculate the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.\n\nCalculations:\n1. The percentage of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team is 24%.\n2. The percentage of members of the swim team who are not members of the chess club is 20%.\n3. To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we need to subtract the percentage of members of the swim team who are not members of the chess club from the percentage of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n\n24% - 20% = 4%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 4%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") 4%"
