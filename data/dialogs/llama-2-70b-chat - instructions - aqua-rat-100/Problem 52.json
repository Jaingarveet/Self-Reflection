Let's try to solve this question again.\n\nStep 1: Identify the amount of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y.\nAlloy X: Zinc = 6/15, Copper = 9/15\nAlloy Y: Zinc = 7/18, Copper = 11/18\n\nStep 2: Set up a proportion to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.\nLet x be the ratio of zinc in alloy Z, and y be the ratio of copper in alloy Z.\nWe know that the total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 40 grams, and the total amount of copper in alloy Z is 60 grams.\nSo, we can set up the following proportion:\n\n6/15 = (40/100) * x\n9/15 = (40/100) * y\n7/18 = (60/100) * x\n11/18 = (60/100) * y\n\nStep 3: Simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying.\nWe get the following system of equations:\n\n40x = 60y\n40y = 60x\n\nStep 4: Solve for x and y.\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.\n\nWe know that 40x = 60y, so we can write:\n\nx = 60y/40\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into the second equation:\n\n40y = 60(60y/40)\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n40y = 3600y/40\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3600:\n\ny/40 = 1/9\n\ny = 40/9\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into the first equation:\n\n40x = 60(40/9)\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n40x = 2400/9\n\nx = 2400/9\n\nStep 5: Find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.\nWe have found that x = 2400/9 and y = 40/9.\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\n2400/9 : 40/9\n\nSimplify:\n\n266 : 44\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 266:44.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
