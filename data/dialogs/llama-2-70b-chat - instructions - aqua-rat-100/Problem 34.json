        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe cost price of the book (CP) can be calculated using the formula:\nCP = SP - Profit\n\nGiven that the book was sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%, the selling price (SP) is:\nSP = CP + Profit\nSP = CP + (10% of CP)\nSP = CP + 0.1CP\nSP = 1.1CP\n\nNow, we can calculate the cost price:\nCP = SP - 1.1CP\nCP = 27.50 - 1.1(27.50)\nCP = 27.50 - 29.75\nCP = -2.25\n\nSince the cost price is negative, it means the selling price was lower than the cost price, resulting in a loss.\n\nNow, let's calculate the new selling price (SP2) when the book was sold for Rs. 25.75:\nSP2 = CP + Profit\nSP2 = -2.25 + (10% of -2.25)\nSP2 = -2.25 + (-0.225)\nSP2 = -2.475\n\nNow, we can calculate the profit percentage:\nProfit % = (Profit/CP) x 100\nProfit % = (2.475 - 27.50)/27.50 x 100\nProfit % = -2.475/27.50 x 100\nProfit % = -8.98%\n\nThe correct answer is E: 4% Loss.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
