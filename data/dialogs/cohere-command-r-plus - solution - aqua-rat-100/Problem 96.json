At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 months\n  B: 4 months\n  C: 23 months\n  D: 24 months\n  E: 84 months\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet [REDACTED] join x months after [REDACTED].\nA's profit for the first [REDACTED] = Rs. 40,000 * (2/12) = Rs. 6,667\nA's profit for the remaining 10 months = Rs. 40,000 * (10/12) * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000\nA's total profit for the year = Rs. 6,667 + Rs. 75,000 = Rs. 81,667\nB's profit for (12-x) months = Rs. 60,000 * (12-x)/12 * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12\nC's profit for x months = Rs. 150,000\nEquation: \nA's profit + B's profit + C's profit = Total profit\nRs. 81,667 + Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12 + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000\nSimplifying the equation:\nRs. 81,667 + Rs. 6,250 * (12-x) + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000\nSolving for x, we get x = 4\n"
