Each layer consists of $5 \\times 5$ smaller cubes, and we have 6 faces of the large cube, so there are $5 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 150$ smaller cubes in the outer surface layer. Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are $6 \\times 150 = 900$ faces in total. Of these, one-third are inside the hollow cube, so $900 \\div 3 = 300$ faces are not painted, and $900 - 300 = 600$ faces are painted. Thus, $900 - 600 = 300$ faces remain unpainted, which is choice E.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
