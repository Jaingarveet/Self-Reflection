This can be simplified to 23:27 by dividing both parts of the ratio by 2. To express this ratio as a fraction in its simplest form, we can multiply both parts by 11 to get whole numbers: (23 * 11):(27 * 11) = 253:297. \n\nFinally, we can simplify this ratio further by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 253 and 297, which is 11. Dividing both parts of the ratio by 11 gives us 23:27, which is the simplest form. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'C: 59:90'.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
