What will be the measure of each side?\nChoices:\n  A: 9\n  B: 11\n  C: 22\n  D: 25\n  E: 31\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe total area of the rectangle is 27 cm x 17 cm = 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. When the rectangle is rebent into a square, the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the square is also 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. \n\nTo find the length of one side of the square, we divide the area by the length of one side: \n45[REDACTED] sq. cm / side = side^2\n\nside^2 = 45[REDACTED]\nside = √45[REDACTED] ≈ 21.4 cm\n\nSince we need an integer side length, we round down to the nearest integer: 21 cm.\n"
