If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field?\nChoices:\n  A: 51 days\n  B: 61 days\n  C: 71 days\n  D: 81 days\n  E: 91 days\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe cow is tethered in the middle and moves in a circular pattern, but the area grazed is square-shaped. The square's side length is half of the rope length, so it's 7 feet. The area of the square field is 7*7 = 49 square feet. Therefore, it will take 49 / 10 = **4.9 days** for the cow to graze the whole field. The closest answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.\n"
