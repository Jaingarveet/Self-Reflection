How much money did John have ?\nChoices:\n  A: 22\n  B: 60\n  C: 28\n  D: 26\n  E: 18\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nLet's assume John has x amount of money. \n\nAccording to Mark, if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, from Mark's perspective: \nJohn's contribution = 1/2 * x\nMark already had: 75 - (1/2)x\n\nAccording to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs. 75. So, from John's perspective: \nJohn's original amount + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75\nThis can be written as: x + (1/3)(2x - 75) = 75\n\nNow, we can solve for x: \n75 = x + (2/3)x - 25\n75 = (5/3)x - 25\n100 = (5/3)x\nx = [REDACTED]\n"

I should have recognized that Mark's statement refers to his amount after receiving money from John, not his initial amount. To correctly solve the problem, I should have set up two equations based on both Mark's and John's perspectives and then solved for the variable representing John's money.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
