For the next 5 quarter-miles, the fare is $0.10 each, bringing us to 6 quarter-miles or 1.5 miles for $4.00. \n\nContinuing in this pattern, we can travel 11 quarter-miles for $8.00, and the next quarter-mile will cost $8.10. As $8.10 is the closest we can get to our budget without going over, this is the maximum distance. \n\nConverting 11 quarter-miles to miles, we get 11 / 4 = 2.75 miles. Adding the quarter-mile included in the flat rate brings us to a final answer of 3.00 miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
