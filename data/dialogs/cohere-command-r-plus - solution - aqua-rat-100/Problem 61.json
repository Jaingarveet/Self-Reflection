Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?\nChoices:\n  A: 180\n  B: 90\n  C: 270\n  D: 360\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nLet the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] be $x$ miles. \nKevin drives at $70$ mph for $\\frac{x}{70}$ hours. \nThen, he immediately drives back at $[REDACTED]$ mph for the same distance, taking $\\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}$ hours. \nThe total trip time is thus $\\frac{x}{70} + \\frac{x}{[REDACTED]} = \\frac{16x}{630} = \\frac{8x}{315}$. \n\n$3$ hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching [REDACTED]. \nAt this point, he had traveled for $\\frac{8x}{315} - \\frac{17}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}$ hours. \nDuring this time, he covered the distance $(70 \\text{ mph}) \\times (\\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hour}) = \\frac{35}{3}$ miles. \n\nThe remaining distance to [REDACTED] is $70$ miles, so the total distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] is $x = \\frac{35}{3} + 70 = 175$ miles. \nTherefore, the correct answer is $[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]$ miles.\n"
