He went to see his doctor and the doctor gave him 5 tablets asking him to take one tablet every 15 minutes.\nHow much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?\nChoices:\n  A: 45 Min\n  B: 75 Min\n  C: 90 Min\n  D: 120 Min\n  E: 60 Min\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe time interval between each tablet consumption is 15 minutes. \nTo find the total time to consume all 5 tablets, we recognize that '15 minutes' is a quarter of an hour, and therefore, 5 tablets will take 5 * 15 minutes = 5 * 1/4 hours = 5/4 hours.\nConverting this fraction to minutes, we get 5/4 hours * 60 minutes = 75/4 minutes = 18.75 minutes.\nSo, the correct answer is 75 minutes, or choice [REDACTED].\n"
