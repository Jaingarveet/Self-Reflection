What then is the length of the space shuttle?\nChoices:\n  A: 50 m\n  B: 75 m\n  C: 100 m\n  D: 125 m\n  E: 150 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe shuttle's speed = distance/time = 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. This is its vertical speed. \n\nHowever, to find the length of the shuttle, we need to use a different calculation. The shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so we can find its length by using this formula: \nLength = distance/time = 700m/5s = 140m \n\nThe length of the shuttle is 140 meters, which matches choice [REDACTED].\n"
