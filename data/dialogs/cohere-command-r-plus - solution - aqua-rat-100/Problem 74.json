How many different quadrilaterals can be formed by joining 4 of the points A,B,C,D,E and F?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 10\n  C: 5\n  D: 15\n  E: 20\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThere are [REDACTED] choices for the first point and 4 choices for the second point. For the third point, there are 3 choices, and for the fourth point, there are 2 choices. The number of ways to choose 4 out of [REDACTED] points is calculated as [REDACTED] x 4 x 3 x 2 = [REDACTED]0. However, this includes quadrilaterals with intersecting sides, which cannot be formed. \n\nThere are 4 choices for the first point ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], D), and for the second point, there are 3 choices ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], D). The third point has 2 choices, and the fourth point is determined. This results in 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 quadrilaterals with intersecting sides. \n\nTo find the total number of valid quadrilaterals, subtract the intersecting ones from the total: [REDACTED]0 - 24 = 96. \n\nNow, we need to consider the quadrilaterals that include point F. There are [REDACTED] choices for the three remaining points, resulting in [REDACTED] valid quadrilaterals that include the center point. \n\nTherefore, the final count of unique quadrilaterals is 96 + [REDACTED] = **[REDACTED]1**.\n"
