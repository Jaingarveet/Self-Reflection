What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nThe company produces 420 units of the component monthly, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5040 components. \n\nTo make a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must exceed the production costs by this amount. \n\nTotal production costs are 5040 * $110 = $554,400 \n\nSo, the total sales revenue required is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800 \n\nNow, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: \n\n$1,180,800 / 420 = $[REDACTED]0 / 9 = $311.11 (rounded to the nearest cent) \n\nSo, the correct answer is [REDACTED].\n"

The closest option is $20 more, making the answer $254.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
