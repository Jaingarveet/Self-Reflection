There are [REDACTED] options for Susan. Once Susan's position is fixed, there are [REDACTED] children left to be seated, and they can be arranged in [REDACTED] ways. Hence, there are a total of $[REDACTED] \\times [REDACTED] = 4$ arrangements.\n\nHowever, one of these arrangements does not follow the constraint as it places Susan to the right of Tim. So, we subtract [REDACTED] from the total to get $4-[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]$ valid arrangements.\n"
