During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven that Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and they made a total of 35 toys, we can assume they worked for a similar duration. \n\nLet's calculate the number of hours each person worked, considering their individual rates: \nFor Alex: \n - Hours worked = 7 hours/toy * Toys made = 7 * 35 = 245 hours \n\nFor Jacob: \n - Hours worked = 9 hours/toy * Toys made = 9 * Total toys made by Jacob = 9 * unknown\n\nWe know they worked for almost the same number of hours, so: \n - 245 hours (Alex) ≈ 9 * Toys made by Jacob \n\nNow, we can solve for the number of toys made by Jacob: \n - Toys made by Jacob ≈ 245/9 ≈ 27.2 \n\nSince Jacob cannot make a fraction of a toy, he made 27 toys. \n\nSo, Jacob made [REDACTED] toys, which is choice [REDACTED].\n"
