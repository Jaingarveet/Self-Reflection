In the first 10 months of this year,the store has sold an average(arithmetic mean) of only 20 microwave ovens per month. What was the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period ?\nChoices:\n  A: 21\n  B: 30\n  C: 31\n  D: 32\n  E: None of the above\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nFor the first 19 months, an average of 42 microwave ovens were sold per month. \nSo, a total of 19 * 42 = 798 microwaves were sold.\nIn the next 10 months, an average of 20 microwave ovens were sold per month. \nThus, a total of 10 * 20 = 200 microwaves were sold.\nIn the total 22 months, 798 + 200 = 998 microwaves were sold.\nTo find the average number of sales per month, divide the total number of microwaves sold (998) by the number of months (22). \n998 / 22 = 45.36, which rounds to 45.\nThe average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 45.\n"

I should have calculated the total number of ovens sold over the entire 22-month period and then divided by 22 to find the average. Now, I have corrected my calculation and arrived at the correct answer, which is 45.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
