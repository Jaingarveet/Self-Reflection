Here is my self-reflection:\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* I misunderstood the information provided in the passage.\n* I failed to analyze the given choices carefully.\n* I did not consider the context of the passage and the assertions made in it.\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is (C) The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage states that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. Therefore, the assertion that house prices will definitely increase as land development costs increase is doubtful. This is because the passage suggests that land prices are the primary driver of housing prices, rather than the cost of land development.\n\nAdvice:\nTo improve my answer, I should have carefully read and analyzed the passage, paying close attention to the information provided and the assertions made. I should also have considered the context of the passage and the topic of the question. Additionally, I should have evaluated each choice carefully and considered the evidence provided in the passage to determine the most doubtful assertion."
