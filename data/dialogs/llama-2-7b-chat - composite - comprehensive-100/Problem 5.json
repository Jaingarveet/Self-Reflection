However, your method of solving the problem is not correct.\n\nYou started by letting the age of the nth member be x, and then calculated the age of the (n+1)th member as x + 3. This is correct. However, you did not continue the calculation correctly. Instead of combining like terms, you wrote:\n\nx + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + [REDACTED]0) = [REDACTED]0\n\nThis is not the correct formula for an [REDACTED].P. The formula for an [REDACTED].P. is:\n\na1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6\n\nYou should have substituted the values:\n\na1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + [REDACTED]0\n\nAnd then solved for n.\n\nSo, the correct solution is:\n\nn = [REDACTED]\n\nAnswer: B\n\nHowever, the correct answer is [REDACTED].

My mistake was in not continuing the calculation correctly after finding the age of the first member. I should have combined like terms and used the formula for an arithmetic series to find the number of members in the club.\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, I will use the formula for an arithmetic series:\n\na1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6\n\nwhere a1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + [REDACTED]0.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nx + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + [REDACTED]0) = [REDACTED]0\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\nx + [REDACTED]0 = [REDACTED]0\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the number of members in the club is [REDACTED].\n\nAnswer: B\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous mistake, and I hope this solution is correct.
