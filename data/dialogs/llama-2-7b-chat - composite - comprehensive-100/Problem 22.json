Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly identified the possible days on which each of the students could give their oral reports based on the conditions provided.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the conditions\n - Incorrect reasoning\nSolution:\nGeorge can give a report on Tuesday, as it is the only day he is allowed to give a report.\nNina can give a report on either Monday or Tuesday, as the conditions do not specify which day she must give her report.\nRobert cannot give a report on Wednesday, as the conditions state that he cannot give an afternoon report on that day.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the days on which each student can give their oral report.\n2. Use the conditions provided to determine the possible days on which each student can give their report.\n3. Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct day on which each student can give their report.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.\n - Use the conditions provided to determine the possible days on which each student can give their report.\n - Double-check your reasoning and calculations to ensure accuracy.\n - Always choose the answer that corresponds to the correct day on which each student can give their report.\n"
