What should the monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500?\nChoices:\n  A: $50000\n  B: $40000\n  C: $30000\n  D: $20000\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nYou are correct that the monthly sales should be $20,000 to reach a monthly salary of $1500. However, the answer I provided is incorrect. The correct answer is (D) $20,000.\n\nHere's why:\n\nYou set up the equation correctly:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1500\n\nSubtracting $500 from both sides gives you:\n\n$500 + (monthly sales x 5%) = $1000\n\nDividing both sides by 5% gives you:\n\nMonthly sales = $20,000\n\nGreat job!\n\nHere are some tips to help you with similar problems in the future:\n\n1. Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n2. Use the given information to set up the equation or formula that will help you solve the problem.\n3. Isolate the variable or terms that you want to solve for.\n4. Use algebraic manipulation to solve for the variable or term you are trying to find.\n5. Check your answer to make sure it is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nKeep practicing, and you'll get better and better at solving math problems!\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
