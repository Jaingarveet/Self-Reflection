Two equations are linearly independent if they do not represent the same line. If they are linearly dependent, they either represent the same line (infinite solutions) or parallel lines (no solution).\n\nTo check for linear dependence, we can compare the slopes of the two equations. If the slopes are equal, the equations are linearly dependent.\n\nThe slope of the first equation is $-3$. The slope of the second equation is $-\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nSetting the slopes equal to each other, we get $-3 = -\\frac{a}{2}$. Solving for $a$, we get $a = 6$.\n\nHowever, we need to check if this value of $a$ results in parallel lines or the same line. To do this, we can compare the y-intercepts of the two equations. If the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel and there is no solution.\n\nThe y-intercept of the first equation is $6$. The y-intercept of the second equation is $4$.\n\nSince the y-intercepts are different, the lines are parallel and there is no solution when $a = 6$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
