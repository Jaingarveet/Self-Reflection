So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.\nQuestion: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?\nChoices:\n  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.\n  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.\n  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.\n  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.\n  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.\n"

It assumes that because squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover, then a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. This is a fallacy because it ignores the possibility that squirrels might eat from a bird feeder even if it has a protective cover.\nThe flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments:\n* **Choice A:** This argument is similar to the context argument because it assumes that because a tire's pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, then a car owner who checks the tire pressure regularly will not have a tire that wears out prematurely. This is a fallacy because it ignores the possibility that a tire's pressure might become too low even if the car owner checks it regularly.\n* **Choice B:** This argument is also similar to the context argument because it assumes that because a tire's pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, then a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. This is a fallacy because it ignores the possibility that a tire's pressure might become too low even if the car owner checks it regularly.\n* **Choice C:** This argument is not similar to the context argument because it does not make a flawed syllogism. It simply states that tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly and then suggests that car owners need to be made aware of this fact.\n* **Choice D:** This argument is similar to the context argument because it assumes that because a tire's pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, then a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. This is a fallacy because it ignores the possibility that a tire's pressure might become too low even if the car owner checks it regularly.\n* **Choice E:** This argument is not similar to the context argument because it does not make a flawed syllogism. It simply states that if a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, but it also states that it will wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. It then concludes that keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer if it is often driven on gravel roads.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
