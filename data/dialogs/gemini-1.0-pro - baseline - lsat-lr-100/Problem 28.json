Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\n"

We need to find the answer that weakens this claim the most.\n**Let's analyze each option:**\n* **A:** This supports the argument by showing a general increase in crime, including violent crime.\n* **B:** This is irrelevant as the argument focuses on the overall likelihood of being a victim, not specific age groups.\n* **C:** This weakens the argument by suggesting more crimes are being reported, potentially inflating the perceived increase.\n* **D:** This weakens the argument by showing proactive measures to address the issue, potentially reducing crime.\n* **E:** This weakens the argument by suggesting the problem might be concentrated in a smaller group, not affecting everyone equally.\n**Conclusion:**\nOption **C** most seriously weakens the argument by suggesting the reported increase might not reflect a true rise in violent crime but rather increased reporting.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\") \n"
