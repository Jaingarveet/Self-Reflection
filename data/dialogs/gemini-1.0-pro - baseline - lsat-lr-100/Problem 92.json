It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child.\n  B: Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt.\n  C: The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it.\n  D: The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.\n  E: The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.\n"

This implies that the curator believes that the hippopotamus was intentionally damaged as part of a religious ritual.\nAssumption A is not required because the argument does not depend on whether the tomb belonged to a child.\nAssumption B is not required because the argument does not depend on whether earthenware figures were ever used as children's toys.\nAssumption C is not required because the argument does not depend on whether the tomb was undisturbed after the hippopotamus was placed in it.\nAssumption D is required because if the hippopotamus' legs were broken naturally, then it would not be evidence of a religious ritual.\nAssumption E is not required because the argument does not depend on whether the hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
