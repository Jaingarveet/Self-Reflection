        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\n"

        "content": "## Analysis:\nThe passage describes how the presence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere can be used to distinguish between stars and brown dwarfs. \n* **Stars with mass equal to or greater than the Sun:** \n    * Have incomplete mixing in their nuclear furnaces, leaving lithium in their atmospheres.\n* **Stars with less mass than the Sun:** \n    * Have complete mixing in their nuclear furnaces, consuming all lithium.\n* **Brown dwarfs:** \n    * Do not have fully functional nuclear furnaces, so their lithium remains unconsumed.\n## Evaluating the choices:\n* **A:** Incorrect. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun also lack lithium.\n* **B:** Correct. The presence of lithium indicates incomplete mixing, which is characteristic of stars with mass equal to or greater than the Sun.\n* **C:** Incorrect. Brown dwarfs, which have lithium, are less massive than stars.\n* **D:** Incorrect. The passage states that stars with less mass than the Sun also have lithium.\n* **E:** Incorrect. Brown dwarfs, which are less massive than stars, have lithium.\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
