The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: There was the same number of people in each group.\n  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.\n  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.\n  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.\n  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.\n"
