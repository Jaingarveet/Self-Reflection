So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: It makes an appeal to a general principle.\n  B: It denies the good faith of an opponent.\n  C: It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.\n  D: It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy.\n  E: It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses.\n"
