Therefore, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.\nQuestion: Which one of the following uses flawed reasoning most similar to that used in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.\n  B: Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.\n  C: Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly. Thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment.\n  D: Some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend. Thus, some of the decisions regarding school curricula should be made without regard for the wishes of the children's parents.\n  E: Only a small percentage of the profits that companies make are directly attributable to good management decisions. Thus, even companies that are managed badly will usually turn a profit.\n"

It assumes that scholars and those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are mutually exclusive groups.\nB: This uses a converse error. It reverses the relationship between the two groups.\nC: This uses a faulty generalization. It concludes that no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment based on the actions of some corporations.\nD: This uses a flawed reasoning pattern similar to the original argument. It assumes that parents who show no interest in school curricula and parents whose wishes should be considered are mutually exclusive groups.\nE: This uses a faulty generalization. It concludes that all companies will turn a profit regardless of management decisions based on the fact that some profits are not directly attributable to good management.\nTherefore, the answer that uses flawed reasoning most similar to the original argument is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
