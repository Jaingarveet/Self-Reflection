Read the question carefully and identify the specific term \"isthmus classification.\"\n2. Recall the contributions of Dr. Kim to endodontics, specifically his root canal isthmus classification.\n3. Avoid misassociating root canal classifications with other notable endodontists, such as Vertucci, who focused on the number of canals rather than isthmi.\n4. Select the correct choice, which is A: Kim.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the specific terms or keywords in the question.\n - Be aware of common misconceptions or misassociations in the field.\n - Ensure that you thoroughly understand the contributions of key figures in the field.\n - Avoid making assumptions or oversights based on partial knowledge.\n - Cross-reference the provided choices with your knowledge to ensure an accurate match.\n"
