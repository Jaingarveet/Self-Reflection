        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation: I overlooked the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. I focused on the other conditions and missed this critical point. I should have started by placing the pharmacy in one of the end positions and then worked through the other requirements. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Oversight\n- Misinterpretation\n- Pharmacy placement\n\nSolution: \nStep 1: Start by placing the pharmacy at one end, as per the constraints. We can choose to place it in space 1 or space 7. Let's choose space 1 for now. \n\nStep 2: The other end must be occupied by one of the restaurants. Place one restaurant in space 7. \n\nStep 3: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Let's place the optometrist in space 2, next to the pharmacy. \n\nStep 4: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Place the toy store in space 3, next to the optometrist. \n\nStep 5: We now have the veterinarian, the second restaurant, and the shoe store left to place. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Place the veterinarian in space 4, next to the toy store. \n\nStep 6: The shoe store can now be placed in space 5. \n\nStep 7: Finally, the second restaurant goes in space 6. \n\nThe final order is: pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, veterinarian, shoe store, restaurant, restaurant. This matches choice E. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Start by placing the pharmacy at one end. \n2. Place a restaurant at the other end. \n3. Place the optometrist or veterinarian next to the pharmacy. \n4. Place the toy store, ensuring it's not next to the veterinarian. \n5. Place the remaining business from step 3, if not already placed. \n6. Place the shoe store and second restaurant, ensuring the restaurants are separated by at least two businesses. \n7. Double-check that all constraints are met. \n\nAdvice: \n- Read and understand all the constraints before starting. \n- Prioritize the constraints and tackle them one by one. \n- Start with the constraints that have a definite placement, like the pharmacy and restaurant in this case. \n- Work systematically through the remaining constraints. \n- Double-check your final arrangement against all constraints. \n- Be mindful of negative constraints (e.g., \"cannot be next to\") and ensure you interpret them correctly.\n"
