I made a calculation error when simplifying the equation $3x - \\frac{244}{7} = -23$ and ended up with $x = \\frac{83}{21}$ instead of the correct value, $x = 3$. This led me to choose answer option D, which was incorrect. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Simplification error\n- Fraction arithmetic error\n\nSolution: Solving the system of equations step by step: \n\n$\\begin{array}{r}\n3x + 4y = -23 \\quad \\cdot2 \\\\\n6x + 8y = -46 \\\\\n\\end{array}$\n\n$\\begin{array}{r}\n2y - x = -19 \\quad \\cdot4 \\\\\n8y - 4x = -76 \\\\\n\\end{array}$\n\nAdding the two equations eliminates $y$:\n$6x + 8y + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$\n$14y = -122$\n$y = -\\frac{122}{14} = -8.71$ (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nNow, plug $y$ into one of the original equations to find $x$:\n$3x + 4y = -23$\n$3x + 4(-8.71) = -23$\n$3x - 34.84 = -23$\n$3x = 11.84$\n$x = \\frac{11.84}{3} \\approx 3.95$ (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nSo, the solution is $(x, y) \\approx (3.95, -8.71)$, which is closest to choice **B**. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4 to clear the fractions.\n2. Add the two equations to eliminate $y$.\n3. Solve for $y$ in the resulting equation.\n4. Plug the value of $y$ into one of the original equations.\n5. Solve for $x$.\n6. Check your calculations and the final answer. \n\nAdvice:\n- Always distribute multiplication over addition/subtraction when simplifying equations. \n- Be careful with fractions and perform calculations accurately. \n- Double-check your arithmetic and calculations at each step. \n- When approximating decimal values, round consistently to a set number of decimal places. \n- Always check your final answer choices for the best match.\n"
