I should have distributed the $7$ to both terms in $7(8-b)$, which would have given me $56-7b=c$. This would have led to the correct values for $c$. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Distribution error\n- Sign error\n\nSolution: \n\nWe are given that $(ax + 2)(bx + 7) = 15x^2 + cx + 14$ for all values of $x$. \n\nExpanding the left side: \n$(ax + 2)(bx + 7) = abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$\n\nComparing coefficients, we get: \n$ab = 15$\n$7a = c$\n$2b = 1$\n\nSolving for $b$ in the last equation, we get $b = \\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nWe are also given that $a + b = 8$. \n\nPlugging in $b = \\frac{1}{2}$, we get: \n$a + \\frac{1}{2} = 8$ \n$a = 8 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{15}{2}$\n\nNow, we can find $c$ by plugging $a = \\frac{15}{2}$ into $7a = c$: \n$c = 7 \\cdot \\frac{15}{2} = \\frac{105}{2} = 52.5$\n\nSo, the two possible values for $c$ are $31$ and $41$. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Expand the left side of the equation and match coefficients. \n2. Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the given equations. \n3. Plug the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression $7a$ to find the two possible values for $c$. \n4. Check your calculations and ensure you are correctly solving for $c$. \n\nAdvice: \n - Always distribute when expanding equations. \n - Pay attention to signs and distribute them correctly. \n - Double-check your calculations and ensure you are solving for the correct variable. \n - Read the question carefully and identify all given equations or values. \n - Don't rush; take your time and work through each step methodically.\n"
