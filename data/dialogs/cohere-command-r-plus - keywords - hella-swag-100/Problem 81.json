[step] You can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. Often, diviners use forked sticks from trees such as willow, peach, and witch hazel.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Some people also use exaggerated branches or canes because canes have been used so often in witchcraft. There may even be string hung from the branches before getting started on your project.\n  B: Look for a stick that has a fork with branches of equal length on either end of the fork. [substeps] If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod.\n  C: You will buy one in a hardware store or hunting store. [substeps] Dowsing or divining rods are no different than sticks, and will require signatures on the stick, such as a helix, that you'll use to figure out how to cast your spells.\n  D: These cast sparks, and are useful tools for lighting up a fire.
