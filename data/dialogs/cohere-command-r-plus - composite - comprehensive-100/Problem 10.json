If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?\nChoices:\n  A: Rs 400\n  B: Rs 500\n  C: Rs 600\n  D: Rs 700\n  E: Rs 800\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Arithmetic error\n- Division error\n- Calculation error\n\nSolution:\nThe total amount to be distributed is Rs. 8600, and there are 11 family members in total: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. \n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of family members: \nTotal family members = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. \n\nStep 2: Find the share for each nephew: \nNephew's share = Total amount / Total family members = Rs. 8600 / 11 = Rs. 781.82 (rounded to two decimal places). \n\nStep 3: Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share: \nDaughter's share = 4 * Nephew's share = 4 * Rs. 781.82 = Rs. 3127.28. \n\nStep 4: Check the answer options: \nOption [REDACTED] offers the closest rounded value to our calculated result, so the final answer is [REDACTED]. \n\nInstructions:\n- Calculate the total number of family members. \n- Find the share for each nephew by dividing the total amount by the total number of family members. \n- Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share. \n- Check the answer options for the closest match to your calculated result. \n\nAdvice:\n- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dividing amounts. \n- Pay attention to the relationships between the amounts received by different family members. \n- Ensure you understand the question's context and relationships before beginning calculations. \n- Rounding values can help simplify calculations, but be mindful of significant figures and potential rounding errors.\n"
