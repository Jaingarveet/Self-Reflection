Thus, it is not a common agent for chemical peeling, which focuses on exfoliation and surface skin renewal. \n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the purpose of chemical peeling and the types of agents typically used. \n2. Evaluate each option independently, considering their unique properties and mechanisms of action. \n3. Avoid making assumptions about the completeness of the choices provided. \n4. Specifically, consider the mechanism of action and target skin concerns for each agent. \n5. Identify the agent that does not align with the typical goals of chemical peeling, which is primarily exfoliation and surface skin renewal. \n\nAdvice:\n- Avoid making assumptions about the choices provided. \n- Understand the fundamental mechanisms and goals of the procedure or treatment in question. \n- Consider unique properties and mechanisms of action for each option, rather than treating them interchangeably. \n- Be mindful of the specificity of the question and ensure that your answer aligns with the precise nature of the inquiry.\n"
