Expand the left side of the equation and match coefficients. \n2. Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the given equations. \n3. Plug the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression $7a$ to find the two possible values for $c$. \n4. Check your calculations and ensure you are correctly solving for $c$. \n\nAdvice:\n - Always distribute when expanding equations. \n - Pay attention to signs and distribute them correctly. \n - Double-check your calculations and ensure you are solving for the correct variable. \n - Read the question carefully and identify all given equations or values. \n - Don't rush; take your time and work through each step methodically.\n"
