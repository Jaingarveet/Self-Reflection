What is the length of line segment RU?\nChoices:\n  A: 6\n  B: 7\n  C: 8\n  D: 9\n  E: 10\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Calculation error\n- Length calculation error\n\nSolution:\n\nGiven:\n- RS = 5\n- RT = 1[REDACTED]\n- ST = 22\n\nWe want to find RU. \n\nSince U is the midpoint of ST, then:\n- UT = 22 / 2 = 11\n\nNow, we can find RU:\n- RU = RT - UT = 1[REDACTED] - 11 = [REDACTED]\n\nSo, the length of line segment RU is [REDACTED].\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST.\n2. Identify the relationship between the segments: U is the midpoint of ST.\n3. Calculate the length of UT since U is the midpoint: UT = ST / 2.\n4. Find the length of RU using the given information: RU = RT - UT.\n5. Double-check your calculations and the relationship between the segments.\n[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the question carefully and identify the given information.\n- Draw a diagram if it helps visualize the problem.\n- Clearly define the variables and relationships in the problem.\n- Double-check your calculations and the logic behind them.\n- Ensure you understand the geometric properties and definitions involved.\n"
