This weakens the argument about more wealthy individuals investing.\nOption C talks about speculators, which doesn't directly address the number of wealthy individuals or their motivation for buying.\nOption D talks about the attractiveness of the US market, which supports the argument rather than weakening it.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
