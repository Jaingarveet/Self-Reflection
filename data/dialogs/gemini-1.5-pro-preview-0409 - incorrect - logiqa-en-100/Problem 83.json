This leaves no room for G, as we already have 3 players (F, M, and either J or K). So, option A is not guaranteed.\n*   Option B (E and M): If M is in, F must be in (condition 4). This contradicts condition 1 (E or F, but not both). So, option B is not possible.\n*   Option C (F and K): If F is in, M must be in (condition 4). This leaves no room for K, as we already have 3 players (F, M, and either J or K). So, option C is not guaranteed.\n*   Option D (G and K): If K is in, J cannot be (condition 2). This doesn't contradict G being in, as condition 3 only specifies that J implies G, not the other way around. This combination satisfies all conditions and doesn't lead to contradictions. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
