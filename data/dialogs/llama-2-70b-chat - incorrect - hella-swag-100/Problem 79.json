Option A, \"is shown, all in black and white,\" does not relate to the context of the text and seems out of place. Option B, \"shows additional information about the wash,\" could be a possible completion, but it is not the most likely choice given the context. Option C, \"is shown with a river flowing,\" is also unrelated to the context. Option D, \"is shown of a price tag,\" does not make sense in the context of a dog being bathed. Therefore, the most likely completion is Option A."
