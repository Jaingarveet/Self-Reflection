Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?\nChoices:\n  A: The cost and selling price of \"Inferno\" are lower than that of \"Harbour\".\n  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.\n  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.\n  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to \"Inferno\" magazine.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the argument\n - Ignoring relevant options\n - Narrow interpretation of the argument\n"

The argument is that some advertisers refused to renew their contracts with the \"Inferno\" magazine because of its violent and pornographic content, which shows that these advertisers consider their ethical responsibilities. To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports this idea. Option B is irrelevant because it does not address the ethical concerns of the advertisers. Option A is also irrelevant because it does not address the advertisers' ethical concerns. Option D is also irrelevant because it does not address the ethical concerns of the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts. Option C is the best answer because it supports the idea that advertisers who advertise in family magazines are not interested in violent and pornographic content, which strengthens the argument that the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts with \"Inferno\" magazine did so because of their ethical concerns. \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
