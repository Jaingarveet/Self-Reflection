So, if F is not selected, then M will not be selected.\nUsing these conditions, we can eliminate some choices:\n- A: F and H cannot be selected together because E or F has one person to participate, but not both.\n- C: G and M cannot be selected together because unless F participates, M does not participate.\n- D: H and M cannot be selected together because unless F participates, M does not participate.\nSo, the only possible choice is B: G and J.\nIf J is selected, then G will also be selected. And, either E or F will be selected. So, the team can be formed by selecting G, J, and either E or F. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
