One solution is $a = 3, b = 5$, and the other is $a = 6, b = 2$.\n\nPlugging these values back into the equation $7a = c$, we get:\n$c = 3 \\times 7 = 21$ for $a = 3$\n$c = 6 \\times 7 = 42$ for $a = 6$\n\nSo, the two possible values for $c$ are 21 and 42.\n\nHowever, these values are not among the choices given.\n\nLet's go back and check our calculations. We can see that we made a mistake in the expansion of the left side of the equation. The correct expansion is:\n$(ax+2)(bx+7)=abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$\n\nComparing coefficients, we should have the system of equations:\n$ab = 15$\n$7a = c$\n$2b = 14$\n\nSolving this system of equations, we find the solutions $a = 3, b = 5, c = 35$ and $a = 6, b = 7, c = 42$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $c = 35$ and $c = 42$, which correspond to choices B and D, respectively.\nAction: Answer(\"B,D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

I also failed to consider that the question asked for the two possible values of $c$, not the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Algebraic error\n- Binomial expansion error\n- System of equations error\n\nSolution: We are given the equation:\n$(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$\n\nExpanding the left side:\n$(a x+2)(b x+7)=abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$\n\nComparing coefficients:\n$ab = 15$\n$7a = c$\n$2b = 14 \\Rightarrow b = 7$\n\nWe are also given $a + b = 8$.

The correct answer is D: 31 and 41, as these are the only options that yield a value of 7 when added together.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Expand the left side of the equation and compare coefficients with the right side.\n2. Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the given equation $a + b = 8$.\n3. Plug the value of $b$ into the equation $ab = 15$ to find $a$.\n4. Calculate the value of $c$ using the equation $7a = c$.\n5. Find the two values of $c$ that satisfy the equation when $a$ and $b$ are varied.\n6. Ensure your values of $c$ satisfy the original equation.\n7. Choose the answer option that matches these values of $c$.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and identify exactly what is being asked.\n- Double-check your expansion of binomial expressions and coefficient comparisons.\n- Solve one variable at a time and substitute known values back into the equations.\n- Always validate your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\n- Remember that the question may ask for specific values, not variables."
