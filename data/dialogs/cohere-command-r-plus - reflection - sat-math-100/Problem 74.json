I made a calculation error when simplifying the numerator of the final fraction. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Simplification error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Calculation error\n\nSolution: \nWe can rationalize the denominator of the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}} \\cdot \\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)(x+3)} = \\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)+(x+3)} = \\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$.\n\nThen, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $2x+5$:\n$\\frac{(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5)}{(2x+5)^2}$.\n\nSimplifying the numerator, we get:\n$(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5) = 2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30$.\n\nSimplifying the denominator, we get:\n$(2x+5)^2 = 4x^2 + 20x + 25$.\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is:\n$\\frac{2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30}{4x^2 + 20x + 25}$.\n\nTo get the expression in the form given in the choices, we need to find the common denominator of the fraction, which is $4x^2 + 20x + 25$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $\\frac{x^2+5x+6}{x^2+5x+6}$, we get:\n$\\frac{(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6)}{(4x^2 + 20x + 25)(x^2+5x+6)}$.\n\nSimplifying the numerator, we get:\n$(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6) = x^5 + 8x^4 + 35x^3 + 70x^2 + 100x + 150$.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent expression is:\n$\\frac{x^5 + 8x^4 + 35x^3 + 70x^2 + 100x + 150}{x^2 + 5x + 6}$.\n\nThis matches the expression in choice B, $\\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{2x + 5}$.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Rationalize the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate.\n2. Simplify the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction.\n3. Check if the resulting fraction matches any of the choices.\n4. If not, multiply the numerator and denominator by the expression that makes the denominator match one of the choices.\n5. Simplify the resulting fraction and choose the correct answer.\n\nAdvice:\n- Be careful with fraction simplification and multiplication.\n- Double-check your calculations and simplify each step completely before moving on. \n- Be cautious when multiplying complex expressions. \n- Ensure that you understand the properties of fractions and rational expressions."
