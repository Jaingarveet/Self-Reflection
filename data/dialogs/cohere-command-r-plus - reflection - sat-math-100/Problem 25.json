Substituting this into the second equation yields $2x^2 + 6 = 2x + 6$. Simplifying and rearranging gives $x^2 - x - 3 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, we find that the positive solution is $x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$. Substituting back into the first equation gives $y = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}$. So, $xy = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{13} + 13}{4} = \\frac{14 + 2\\sqrt{13}}{4}$. This simplifies to $3 + \\sqrt{13}$, which does not match any of the given choices.\n\nTherefore, the given answer choices are incorrect.\nAction: None of the above.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
