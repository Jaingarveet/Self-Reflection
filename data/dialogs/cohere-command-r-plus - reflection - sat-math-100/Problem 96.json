        "content": "Explanation:\nI incorrectly set up the equation to solve for the percentage change in the width. \nI should have compared the areas of the original and altered rectangles to account for the 12% decrease in area. \nInstead, I incorrectly equated the altered area to 88% of the original area, leading to an incorrect value for $p$.\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Percentage error\n- Equation setup error\n\nSolution:\nLet $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the rectangle.\nThe original area of the rectangle is $LW$.\nAfter altering the rectangle, the new length is $1.1L$, and the new width is $(1-p/100)W$.\nThe new area of the rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.\nWe are given that this alteration results in a 12% decrease in the area, so $A' = 0.88 \\times LW$.\n\nNow, we set up the equation:\n$$0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n$$0.88 = 1.1(1-p/100)$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by 100:\n$$88 = 110 - 110p/100$$\n\nIsolating $p$:\n$$-110p/100 = -22$$\n$$p = 20$$\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and the variable to be determined ($p$).\n2. Define variables: Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.\n3. Calculate the original area: The area of the rectangle is $LW$.\n4. Calculate the altered area: After changing the length and width, the new area is $(1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.\n5. Set up the equation: The altered area is 12% less than the original area, so set up the equation $0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$.\n6. Simplify the equation: Simplify the equation to isolate $p$.\n7. Solve for $p$: Calculate the value of $p$ by isolating it in the equation.\n8. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches the calculated value of $p$.\n\nAdvice:\n- Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the variable to be solved.\n- Define clear variables to represent the unknown values.\n- Use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the variables.\n- Simplify equations step-by-step to avoid errors.\n- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context.\n- Be cautious when dealing with percentages, and ensure you apply them correctly."
