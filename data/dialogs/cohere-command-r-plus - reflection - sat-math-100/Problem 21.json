I also made a mistake in distributing the negative sign when simplifying the solutions.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Simplification error\n- Sign error\n\nSolution: We are given the quadratic equation $3x^2 + 12x + 6 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we can solve for the values of $x$.
