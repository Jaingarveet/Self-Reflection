        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the data and made an algebra error. I incorrectly assumed a linear relationship between x and y, ignoring the constant term. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Data interpretation error\n- Algebra error\n- Assumption error\n\nSolution: \n\nThe table shows that as x increases by 3a, y decreases by a. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. \n\nThe equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: \n\n$2x - 3y = 0 \\times 5a$. \n\nMultiplying by 5a gives: \n\n$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \\times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \\times a$, or $x + 2y = a$. \n\nInstructions: \n\n1. Examine the table and identify the pattern: as x increases by 3a, y decreases by 1a. \n2. Recognize this as a linear relationship with a negative slope. \n3. Find the y-intercept by identifying the value of y when x=a. \n4. Express the relationship as an equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. \n5. Rearrange the equation to make x the subject, and then multiply by the appropriate value of a to match the options. \n\nAdvice: \n\n- Always examine the data carefully and identify patterns or relationships. \n- Avoid making assumptions; work with the data as it is presented. \n- When dealing with linear relationships, focus on the slope and y-intercept. \n- Practice rearranging equations and identifying equivalent expressions. \n- Double-check your work by substituting values from the table into your equation."
