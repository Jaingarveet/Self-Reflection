Squaring both sides gives $4x=(x-3)^2=x^2-6x+9$. Simplifying this equation gives $3x^2-6x-9=0$.

        "content": "Explanation: I incorrectly assumed that both roots of the quadratic equation were valid solutions to the given equation. The correct answer is $x = 9$, as $x = 1$ does not satisfy the given equation. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Algebraic error\n- Quadratic equation error\n- Invalid solution error\n\nSolution: \n\nGiven equation: $\\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$ \n\nFirst, square both sides: $4x = (x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$ \n\nThis simplifies to: $3x^2 - 6x - 9 = 0$ \n\nUsing the quadratic formula: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 108}}{6} = \\frac{6 \\pm 6\\sqrt{3}}{6}$ \n\nThis gives two values: $x = 1$ and $x = 9$. \n\nHowever, we must now check which of these values satisfy the original equation. \n\nFor $x = 1$: $\\sqrt{4(1)} = 1 - 3$, which is not true. \n\nFor $x = 9$: $\\sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3$, which simplifies to $6 = 6$, a true statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct solution is $x = 9$. \n\nInstructions: \n\n1. Square both sides of the equation, being mindful of the direction of the equality. \n2. Simplify the resulting quadratic equation. \n3. Apply the quadratic formula to find potential solutions. \n4. Check each potential solution in the original equation, not just the simplified quadratic form. \n5. Ensure that the direction of the equality is maintained throughout all steps. \n\nAdvice: \n\n- Always check your solutions in the original equation, not just simplified forms. \n- Be cautious when squaring equations; the direction of the equality is crucial. \n- Understand the difference between solutions to a quadratic equation and valid solutions to the original problem. \n- Take care when applying the quadratic formula, ensuring accurate substitution of coefficients."
