        "content": "Explanation: I incorrectly applied the formula and made a calculation error. I calculated the weight on each planet without considering the mass of the object, which was a fundamental misunderstanding of the formula $W = mg$. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Formula application error\n- Calculation error\n- Incorrect variable usage\n\nSolution: We are given that the weight of an object on Earth is $W = 150$ newtons, and we want to find the planet where this object would weigh approximately $170$ newtons. Using the formula $W = mg$, we can calculate the mass of the object:\n\\[ 150 = m \\cdot 9.8 \\]\n\\[ m \\approx 15.3 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the planet where the product of mass and acceleration due to gravity is closest to $170$. \n\nFor Choice B, Saturn:\n\\[ W = 15.3 \\cdot 11.1 \\approx 170.33 \\]\n\nTherefore, Choice B, Saturn, is the correct answer. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity. \n2. Calculate the mass of the object using the weight on Earth and Earth's acceleration due to gravity. \n3. For each planet, multiply the calculated mass by the respective acceleration due to gravity to find the weight. \n4. Compare the calculated weights to the desired weight of $170$ newtons. \n5. Choose the planet that provides the closest approximation. \n\nAdvice: \n - Always double-check your understanding of the formula and how to apply it. \n - Pay close attention to the units and ensure they match the given values. \n - Carefully read and interpret the data provided in the table or chart. \n - Systematically work through each choice, step-by-step, without rushing to a conclusion. \n - Verify that your calculations and final answer satisfy all conditions of the problem."
