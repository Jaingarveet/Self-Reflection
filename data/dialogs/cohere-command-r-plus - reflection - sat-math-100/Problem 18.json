Identify the expression you need to simplify: $9^{3/4}$. \n2. Recognize that you can rewrite $9^{3/4}$ as $9^{1/4} * 9^{1/2}$. \n3. Simplify $9^{1/4}$ to $\\sqrt[4]{9}$ and $9^{1/2}$ to $\\sqrt{9}$. \n4. Calculate $\\sqrt[4]{9} = 3$ and $\\sqrt{9} = 3^{1/2} = 3\\sqrt{3}$. \n5. Multiply $3$ and $3\\sqrt{3}$ to get $3\\sqrt{3}$. \n\nAdvice: \n- Familiarize yourself with index rules and practice their application. \n- Be cautious when simplifying expressions with multiple indices; break down the problem step-by-step. \n- Double-check your understanding of the rules and their application. \n- Practice similar problems to reinforce your understanding and application of index rules."
