The key is to analyze each option in the context of all the given information and identify any contradictions. \n## Answering the Question:\n**Given:**\n* Three types of cookies: Oatmeal (O), Peanut Butter (P), Sugar (S)\n* Three batches of each type made weekly (Mon-Fri)\n* No two batches of the same type on the same day\n* At least one batch made on Monday\n* 2nd Oatmeal batch = same day as 1st Peanut Butter batch\n* 2nd Sugar batch = Thursday\n**Additional Information:** \n* 1st Peanut Butter batch = Tuesday (from question)\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday.** - This is possible. Since the first Peanut Butter batch is on Tuesday and at least one batch is made on Monday, it could be the first batch of Oatmeal and Sugar cookies.\n* **B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.** - This is NOT possible. We know the first Peanut Butter batch is on Tuesday, and no other first batch can be on the same day. \n* **C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday.** - This is possible. Since the 2nd Oatmeal batch is on the same day as the 1st Peanut Butter batch (Tuesday), the second batch of Sugar cookies could be on Wednesday. \n* **D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday.** - This is possible. We know the 2nd Sugar batch is on Thursday, and the second batch of either Oatmeal or Peanut Butter could also be on Thursday.\n* **E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday.** - This is possible. With the constraints of the other days, it's likely that two types of cookies will have their third batch on Friday.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
