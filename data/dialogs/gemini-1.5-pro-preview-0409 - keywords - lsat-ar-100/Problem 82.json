Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

Missing a detail like \"either/or\" could lead to an invalid assignment.\n* **Overlooking Implications:**  Some conditions have cascading effects. For example, if Parra and Quinn are together, and either Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 if Parra is there.\n* **Not Checking All Conditions:**  It's crucial to verify that the final assignment satisfies *all* given conditions, not just a subset.\n## Solving the Current Problem:\n1. **Parra/Quinn Together:** Options A and B are eliminated as they separate Parra and Quinn.\n2. **Zone 3 Largest:** Options C and E violate the condition that Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.\n3. **Remaining Option:**  Option D places Stuckey and Udall together (satisfying one condition) and leaves Zone 3 with the most representatives. We need to check if the remaining conditions are met.\n4. **Zone 1:**  With Stuckey and Udall in Zone 1, this leaves Kim and Tiao for Zone 2, satisfying the \"either/or\" condition for both zones.\n5. **Final Verification:**  Option D satisfies all conditions:\n    * Parra and Quinn are together.\n    * Stuckey and Udall are together.\n    * Either Parra or Tiao (Tiao in this case) is in Zone 1.\n    * Either Tiao or Udall (Udall in this case) is in Zone 2.\n    * Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
