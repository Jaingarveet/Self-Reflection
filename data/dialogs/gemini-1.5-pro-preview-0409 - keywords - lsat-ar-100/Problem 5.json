Also, the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. \n2. **Fixed Positions:** \n    * I is on the middle shelf.\n    * K is above F.\n    * O is above L.\n    * F and M are on the same shelf.\n3. **Deductions:**\n    * Since K is above F and F is with M, K must be either on the middle shelf with I or on the top shelf.\n    * Since O is above L, they cannot both be on the bottom shelf (which has the most books). So, at least one of them must be on the middle or top shelf.\n4. **Evaluating Options:**\n    * **A:** We don't know O's exact position relative to M. \n    * **B:** We don't know G's position, so we can't compare it to K.\n    * **C:** This MUST be true. Since I is on the middle shelf and K is either on the middle or top shelf (above F), F (and M) must be on the bottom shelf. \n    * **D & E:** We lack information about G and L's positions to make definitive comparisons.\nTherefore, based on the given conditions and deductions, the only option that MUST be true is C.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
