This spot could be for K or O (but not both).\n* If K is on top, then F and M must be on the middle shelf along with I. This would violate the \"more books on bottom shelf\" rule. \n* Therefore, **O must be on the top shelf with G, and K must be on the middle shelf with I.**\n**Analyzing Choices:**\n* **A: H, I:** This doesn't account for K being on the middle shelf.\n* **B: I, L:** This doesn't account for K being on the middle shelf.\n* **C: H, I, L:** This doesn't account for K being on the middle shelf.\n* **D: I, K, L:** This satisfies the conditions with K and I on the middle shelf and O and G on the top shelf, leaving F, M, and H for the bottom shelf.\n* **E: F, I, M:** This would violate the \"more books on bottom shelf\" rule.\n**Therefore, the correct answer is the one that includes I and K on the middle shelf.**\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
