Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Error:\nWhile I don't have access to the specifics of my previous error ([REDACTED]), I can generally analyze potential pitfalls in this type of logic puzzle:\n* **Misinterpreting Rules:**  The complexity arises from the interlinked rules.  It's crucial to consider all rules simultaneously, not in isolation. For instance, focusing solely on \"Robertson > Young\" without considering \"Young > Togowa\" could lead to an error.\n* **Overlooking Possibilities:**  Jumping to conclusions based on limited information is another pitfall.  The question asks for what **must** be true, not what *could* be true.  So, exploring all valid arrangements is necessary before determining the definitive outcome.\n* **Calculation Errors:**  Simple mistakes in ordering or comparing numbers can occur, especially when dealing with multiple constraints.\n## Answering the Current Question:\nGiven Robertson is assigned parking space #3:\n1. **Robertson > Young:**  This means Young must be in #1 or #2.\n2. **Young > Togowa:**  Therefore, Togowa must be in #1 (if Young is in #2) or cannot be placed (if Young is in #1).\n3. **Xu > Souza:**  We don't have enough information to place Xu or Souza definitively yet.\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A: Souza in #4:**  This is possible but not guaranteed. Xu could be in #4, pushing Souza to #1 or #2.\n* **B: Togowa in #2:**  This is impossible as it violates \"Young > Togowa\".\n* **C: Vaughn in #5:**  We have no information restricting Vaughn's placement, so this is not necessarily true.\n* **D: Xu in #6:**  This is possible but not guaranteed.  Xu could be in #4 or #5 depending on Souza's placement.\n* **E: Young in #2:**  This **must** be true based on the given constraints.\nTherefore, the correct answer is: **Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
