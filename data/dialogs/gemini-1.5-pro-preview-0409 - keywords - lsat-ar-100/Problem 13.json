It's crucial to carefully analyze each condition and their implications on the possible schedules.\n**Key Learnings:**\n* **Break down the problem:**  Analyze each condition separately and then combine them to deduce the possible scenarios.\n* **Consider all constraints:** Ensure every condition is satisfied in the proposed solution.\n* **Eliminate possibilities:** Use the conditions to eliminate options that lead to contradictions.\n**Applying Learnings to the Current Problem:**\n1. **Franco and Hong testify on the same day:** This leaves Tuesday or Wednesday as possibilities since Hong cannot be on Monday.\n2. **Iturbe testifies on Wednesday:** This means Franco and Hong cannot be on Wednesday as only one other witness can be there.\n3. **Therefore, Franco and Hong must be on Tuesday:** This satisfies the condition of exactly two witnesses on Tuesday.\n4. **Garcia cannot be on Tuesday:** Due to the constraint with Franco.\n5. **At least one witness on Monday:** This must be Garcia as all others are accounted for.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
