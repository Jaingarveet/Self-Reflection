Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

These are crucial to consider when eliminating possibilities.\n* **Deductive Reasoning:** We need to use the given information and constraints to deduce the schedule step-by-step.\n* **Impact of Lan's Wednesday Absence:**  Since Lan isn't leading a Wednesday session, this opens up possibilities for other assistants and might create a chain reaction affecting the remaining schedule.\n**Approach:**\n1. **Analyze Constraints:** List down each constraint and its implications for the schedule.\n2. **Eliminate Possibilities:** Based on Lan not being on Wednesday, eliminate options for other assistants based on their constraints.\n3. **Deduce Remaining Schedule:**  Use the process of elimination and remaining constraints to determine who MUST lead a Thursday session. \n**Applying this approach should lead to the correct answer.** \n"
