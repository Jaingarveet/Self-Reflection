The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R.

If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

For example, \"at most one\" is different from \"exactly one.\"\n* **Logical Fallacies:**  Jumping to conclusions based on partial information or assuming connections between conditions that don't exist can lead to errors.\n## Answering the Question:\nLet's analyze each option based on the given conditions:\n* **A: F, G, K, P, Q:** This violates the condition that \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\" (Two botanists and two zoologists are present)\n* **B: G, H, K, L, M:** This violates the condition that \"K and M cannot both be selected.\"\n* **C: G, H, K, L, R:** This option seems to satisfy all conditions: one botanist, two chemists, and one zoologist. F and K are not together, K and M are not together, and M is not present, so the condition about P and R is irrelevant.\n* **D: H, K, M, P, R:** This option satisfies the conditions related to M, P, and R, but it violates the condition that \"K and M cannot both be selected.\"\n* **E: H, L, M, P, Q:** This option satisfies the conditions related to M, P, and R, but it violates the condition that \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\" (One botanist and two zoologists are present)\nTherefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
