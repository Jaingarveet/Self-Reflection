However, we need to check if the remaining students can fill the afternoon slots without violating any constraints.\n* **B: Irving, Robert, and Helen:** This option violates the constraint that Robert cannot give an afternoon report, as he would need to present in the afternoon on Monday if assigned the morning slot on Tuesday.\n* **C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia:** This option violates the constraint that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, as she would need to present in the afternoon on Tuesday if assigned the morning slot on Wednesday.\n* **D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving:** This option violates the constraint that both Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.\n* **E: Robert, George, and Helen:** This option violates the constraint that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the only option that seems to satisfy all constraints is **A: Helen, George, and Nina**. We can further verify that the remaining students (Olivia, Irving, and Robert) can fill the afternoon slots without any conflicts.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
