It's crucial to carefully analyze each condition and their implications on the possible schedules.\n**Key Learnings:**\n* **Methodical Approach:** Break down the problem into smaller steps, considering each constraint individually and then in conjunction with others.\n* **Visual Aids:** Utilizing tools like tables or diagrams can help visualize the scheduling possibilities and eliminate inconsistencies.\n* **Elimination Strategy:**  Focus on eliminating options that contradict the given conditions, narrowing down to the correct answer.\n**Applying Learnings to the Current Problem:**\n1. **Iturbe testifies on Wednesday:** This is a fixed condition, leaving Monday and Tuesday for the remaining four witnesses.\n2. **Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday:** This leaves two witnesses for Monday.\n3. **Hong does not testify on Monday:** So, Hong must testify on Tuesday along with one other witness.\n4. **Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia:** This means Franco and Garcia must be on separate days. \n5. **Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday:** This is the new condition we need to incorporate.\n**Analysis with the new condition:**\n* We know Iturbe and Jackson are on Wednesday.\n*  Hong is with one other person on Tuesday.\n* This leaves Franco and Garcia for Monday.\nTherefore, with Jackson on Wednesday, **exactly one witness (Garcia) is scheduled to testify on Monday.** \nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
