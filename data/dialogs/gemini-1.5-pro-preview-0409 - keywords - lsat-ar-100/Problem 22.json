Additionally, F and K cannot both be selected.\n* **B: F or else M:** Similar to A, F cannot be selected with G and H. While M is a possibility, it's not the only option as other chemists could be chosen.\n* **C: K or else M:** This seems plausible. If K is chosen, then we have one from each category (G, H, K). If M is chosen, then P and R must also be selected, fulfilling the requirement with (G, H, M, P, R).\n* **D: M or else Q:**  This is not necessarily true. If K is chosen as the chemist, then Q doesn't need to be selected.\n* **E: P or else Q:** This is also not guaranteed. If K is chosen as the chemist, neither P nor Q is required.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the panel must include either **K or else M** to fulfill all conditions when G and H are selected.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
