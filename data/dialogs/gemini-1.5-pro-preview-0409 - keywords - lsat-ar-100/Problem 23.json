Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina\n  B: Lenore, George, and Irving\n  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore\n  D: Robert, George, and Irving\n  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

It also allows for flexibility with Nina's placement (either Monday or Tuesday morning) without violating any constraints.\nTherefore, based on the given constraints and elimination of conflicting options, the most likely answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
