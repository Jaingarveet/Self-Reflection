I might have focused too much on a single scenario that fit the given conditions, neglecting other valid arrangements. \n## Solving the Problem:\n1. **Analyze Constraints:**\n    - Grain > Livestock > Textiles\n    - Produce > Fuel\n    - Textiles is next to Produce\n2. **Consider Possibilities:**\n    - We need to find a statement that **cannot be true** given these constraints.\n3. **Evaluate Options:**\n    - **A:** Fuel and Machinery have no specific constraints, so they could be next to each other. \n    - **B:** Similarly, Grain and Machinery have no restrictions preventing adjacency.\n    - **C:** Livestock and Fuel also have no direct constraints against being neighbors.\n    - **D:** Produce and Livestock have no direct constraint preventing them from being next to each other.\n    - **E:** Textiles is **next to Produce**, and Produce is **greater than Fuel**. This means there's always at least one bay (Produce) between Textiles and Fuel. \n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, the statement that must be false is **E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.** \n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
