This means S cannot be third (as Q wouldn't be after it) and cannot be second (as it would be before Q which wouldn't be third). So, options C and D are eliminated.\n2. **J, G, and R:** J must be before G, and G must be before R. This means G cannot be second as J wouldn't have a place before it. So, option A is eliminated.\n3. **Remaining Options:** We are left with options B (H is second) and E (Y is third). \n4. **Analyzing Option B:** If H is second, then the first article must be either Q or S (nutrition).  Then, the third article must be the other nutrition article (Q or S). However, this violates the condition that S can only be before Q if Q is third. So, option B is also eliminated. \n5. **Conclusion:** By elimination, the only option that could be true is **E: Y is third**. This allows for a sequence like S-J-Y-G-R-Q-H, satisfying all given conditions.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
