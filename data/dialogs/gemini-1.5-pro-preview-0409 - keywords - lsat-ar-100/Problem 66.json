This leaves the first four positions for Nutrition and Wildlife articles. Since S must be before Y and cannot be third, the only possibility is **S-Q-Y-[Nutrition article]**. \n* **E: Y is fifth:** This contradicts the constraint \"S must be earlier than Y\".\nTherefore, the information that fully determines the order is **R being seventh**. This forces the placement of J, G, and the sequence of S, Q, and Y, leaving only one possible arrangement for the remaining Nutrition article.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
