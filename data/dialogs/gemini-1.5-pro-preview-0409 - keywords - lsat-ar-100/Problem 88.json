The bottom shelf has more books than the top.\n* **Fixed Positions:** \n    * I is on the middle shelf.\n    * K is above F.\n    * O is above L.\n    * F and M are on the same shelf.\n* **Possible Error Sources:**\n    * **Misinterpreting relative positions:**  Statements like \"K is above F\" don't specify the exact shelf for either book, only their relative placement. \n    * **Overlooking shelf capacity:**  With only 3 shelves and at least 2 books per shelf, options leading to overcrowding on one shelf would be invalid.\n    * **Missing interdependence:**  Choosing an option that doesn't provide enough information to determine the placement of all remaining books.\n**Approach to Solving:**\n1. **Analyze each option:**  Consider how each option interacts with the fixed positions and shelf distribution constraints.\n2. **Eliminate options:**  Discard options that contradict the given conditions or don't provide enough information to place all books.\n3. **Identify the option:**  Select the option that definitively places all books on specific shelves without violating any constraints. \n**Applying this approach, let's analyze the options:** \n"
