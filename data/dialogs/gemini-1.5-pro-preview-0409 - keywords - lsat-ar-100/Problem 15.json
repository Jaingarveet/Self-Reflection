Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

I will carefully analyze each constraint and consider all possible valid arrangements to arrive at the correct answer. \n## Answering the Question:\n**Given:** Shoe store is in space 4.\n**Constraints:**\n1. **Pharmacy and Restaurant at Ends:** This leaves spaces 2, 3, 5, and 6 for the remaining businesses.\n2. **Restaurants Separated:**  Restaurants cannot be in both spaces 2 and 5, or 3 and 6.\n3. **Pharmacy Neighbors:**  The pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian.\n4. **Toy Store Restriction:** The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n**Analysis:**\n* **Option A:** We don't have enough information to confirm if the optometrist is next to a restaurant. \n* **Option B:**  This is possible but not guaranteed. The pharmacy could be next to the optometrist instead.\n* **Option C:**  This is possible but not guaranteed.  The toy store's position is flexible.\n* **Option D:**  This is also possible but not guaranteed. The toy store could be in various positions.\n* **Option E:**  This is the only option that **must be true**.  Since the pharmacy and a restaurant occupy the ends, and restaurants must be separated by two spaces, the veterinarian cannot be in spaces 2 or 6. With the shoe store in space 4, the only remaining space for the veterinarian is space 5, making it next to the shoe store.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
