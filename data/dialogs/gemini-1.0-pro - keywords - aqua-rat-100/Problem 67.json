I incorrectly assumed that 6 pita breads were equivalent to 2 rolls, when in fact, the problem states that 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 rolls.\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the problem by focusing on the number of pita breads and rolls instead of the amount of falafel they contain.\n* **Incorrect assumption:** I made an incorrect assumption that the amount of falafel in each pita bread and roll was the same.\n**Corrected solution:**\n1. **Set up the proportions:**\n    * 6 pita breads = 2 rolls\n    * 3 rolls = 5 baguettes\n    * 2 baguettes = x pita breads\n2. **Cross-multiply and solve for x:**\n    * 6 * 3 * 2 = 2 * 5 * x\n    * x = 36 / 10\n    * x = 18 / 5\nTherefore, 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as **18/5 pita breads**.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")**"
