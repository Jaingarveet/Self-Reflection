I will try my best to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I previously made a mistake in calculating the probability of neither event occurring. I incorrectly subtracted the probabilities of the two events instead of multiplying them.\n* **Solution:** To find the probability of neither event occurring, we need to multiply the probability of event A not occurring by the probability of event B not occurring.\n* **Logic:** This is because the two events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other event.\n**Answer:**\nTo calculate the probability of neither event occurring, we can use the following formula:\n```\nP(neither A nor B) = P(not A) * P(not B)\n```\nwhere:\n* P(neither A nor B) is the probability of neither event A nor event B occurring\n* P(not A) is the probability of event A not occurring\n* P(not B) is the probability of event B not occurring\nWe know that the probability of event A occurring is 0.56, so the probability of event A not occurring is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.\nSimilarly, we know that the probability of event B occurring is 0.74, so the probability of event B not occurring is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\nTherefore, the probability of neither event A nor event B occurring is:\n```\nP(neither A nor B) = 0.44 * 0.26 = 0.1144\n```\n**Conclusion:**\nThe greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is **0.1144**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
