I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Error:** I misinterpreted the problem statement and assumed that the price difference was between white and brown sharpeners, not between each white and brown sharpener.\n* **Incorrect assumption:** I incorrectly assumed that the price difference was the same for all white and brown sharpeners.\n* **Logical error:** I made a logical error in my calculations, which led to an incorrect answer.\n**Corrected solution:**\nLet's assume that the price of a white sharpener is x rupees and the price of a brown sharpener is (x-1) rupees.\nAccording to the problem statement, Jack buys 18 sharpeners for rs. 100. So, we can write the equation:\n18x - 18 = 100\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 6.5\nTherefore, the price of a white sharpener is rs. 6.5 and the price of a brown sharpener is rs. 5.5.\nNow, let's find out how many white and brown sharpeners Jack bought.\nLet's assume that Jack bought w white sharpeners and b brown sharpeners. We know that:\nw + b = 18\nAlso, we know that the total cost of the sharpeners is rs. 100. So, we can write the equation:\n6.5w + 5.5b = 100\nSolving these two equations simultaneously, we get:\nw = 9 and b = 9\nTherefore, Jack bought 9 white sharpeners and 9 brown sharpeners.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")**"
