I will try my best to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I made a calculation error in my previous attempt.\n* **Reason:** I did not correctly apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n* **Correction:** I will carefully review the formula and ensure I use it correctly this time.\n**Solution:**\nLet's denote the number of members in the club as n.\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by:\n```\nS = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d]\n```\nwhere:\n* S is the sum of the series\n* n is the number of terms\n* a is the first term\n* d is the common difference\nIn this case, we have:\n* S = 250 years\n* a = 7 years\n* d = 3 months = 0.25 years\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n```\n250 = n/2 * [2 * 7 + (n-1) * 0.25]\n```\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n```\n500 = n * (14 + 0.25n - 0.25)\n500 = n * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n```\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n```\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n```\nThis is a quadratic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula:\n```\nn = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n```\nwhere:\n* a = 0.25\n* b = 13.75\n* c = -500\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we get:\n```\nn = (-13.75 ± √(13.75^2 - 4 * 0.25 * -500)) / 2 * 0.25\nn = (-13.75 ± √(189.0625 + 500)) / 0.5\nn = (-13.75 ± √689.0625) / 0.5\nn = (-13.75 ± 26.25) / 0.5\n```\nWe get two possible solutions:\n* n = 25\n* n = -20\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, the correct answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")**"
