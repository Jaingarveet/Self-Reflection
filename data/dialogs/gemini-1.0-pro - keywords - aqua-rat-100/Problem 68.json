I incorrectly assumed that the LCM was always a multiple of the GCF, which is not always the case.\nTo correctly answer this question, I need to consider the following:\n* The GCF of two integers is the largest integer that divides both integers evenly.\n* The LCM of two integers is the smallest integer that is a multiple of both integers.\n* The product of the GCF and LCM of two integers is equal to the product of the two integers.\nIn this case, the GCF of the two integers is 11, and the LCM is 7700. The product of the GCF and LCM is 11 * 7700 = 84700.\nSince one of the integers is 350, the other integer must be 84700 / 350 = 242.\nTherefore, the other integer is 242.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
