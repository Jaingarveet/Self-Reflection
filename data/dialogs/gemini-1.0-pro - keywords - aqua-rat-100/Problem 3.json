I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I incorrectly identified the capital of Maryland as Baltimore instead of Annapolis.\n* **Cause:** I did not carefully consider the information provided in the question.\n* **Correction:** I will pay closer attention to the details of the question and ensure that my answer is consistent with the information provided.\n**Answer:**\n**Thought:**\n* The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the original square cloth was 140 square feet (70 * 2).\n* Since the area of a square is calculated as side * side, the side of the original square cloth was the square root of 140, which is approximately 11.83 feet.\n* If the square cloth was trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the new length of that edge is 11.83 - 4 = 7.83 feet.\n* The perimeter of the original square cloth was 4 * 11.83 = 47.32 feet.\n* However, since the cloth was trimmed, the new perimeter is 2 * (7.83 + 11.83) = 39.32 feet.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
