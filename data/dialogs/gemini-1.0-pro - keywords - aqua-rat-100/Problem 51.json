I incorrectly assumed that U was the midpoint of line segment RT instead of line segment ST. This led me to choose the wrong answer.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I will carefully read the problem and make sure I understand the information given before attempting to solve it. I will also pay close attention to the wording of the problem, especially when it comes to key terms like \"midpoint.\"\nHere is my step-by-step solution to the problem:\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - R, S, T, and U are points on a line.\n   - U is the midpoint of line segment ST.\n   - The lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively.\n2. Determine the length of line segment SU:\n   - Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the lengths of line segments SU and UT are equal.\n   - Therefore, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST, which is 22/2 = 11.\n3. Determine the length of line segment RU:\n   - The length of line segment RU is the sum of the lengths of line segments RS and SU.\n   - Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 5 + 11 = 16.\nTherefore, the length of line segment RU is 16.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
