I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I overlooked the option of using two letters to represent a book type.\n* **Solution:** I need to consider both single letters and pairs of letters when calculating the minimum number of letters needed.\n* **Constraints:** Each book type must be uniquely represented, and the order of letters in a pair does not matter.\n**Answer:**\nTo represent 10 book types uniquely, we can use:\n* **Single letters:** We can use 10 different letters to represent 10 book types.\n* **Pairs of letters:** We can choose 2 letters out of 26 (ignoring order) to create 26C2 = 325 unique pairs.\nTherefore, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is **10**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\")"
