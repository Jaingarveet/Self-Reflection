I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Error:** I previously answered the question incorrectly.\n* **Reason for error:** I did not consider the condition that the sum of the 5 numbers when divided by 10 should be a perfect square.\n* **Correct approach:**\n    * Find the sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n    * Check if the sum is divisible by 10.\n    * If the sum is divisible by 10, check if the quotient is a perfect square.\n**Solution:**\nLet the 5 consecutive odd numbers be x, x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8.\nThe sum of the 5 numbers is:\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20\nFor the sum to be divisible by 10, 5x must be divisible by 10. This means x must be an even number.\nLet x = 44. Then the 5 numbers are 44, 46, 48, 50, and 52.\nThe sum of the 5 numbers is 240.\n240/10 = 24, which is a perfect square.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: 44.\n**Action:** Answer(\"E\")"
