I will also double-check my calculations to ensure they are correct.\nHere's my revised approach:\nLet X be the original number of friends.\nThe total cost of the picnic was Rs. 96.\nFour friends did not turn up, so the remaining number of friends is X-4.\nEach of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so the total extra contribution is 4(X-4).\nThe total cost is now shared equally among the remaining friends, so each contributes (96 + 4(X-4))/(X-4).\nThis can be expressed as the equation:\n96 + 4(X-4) = (X-4) * (96 + 4(X-4))/(X-4)\nSimplifying the equation:\n96 + 4X - 16 = 96 + 4X - 16\n4X = 96\nX = 24\nTherefore, the original number of friends was 24.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
