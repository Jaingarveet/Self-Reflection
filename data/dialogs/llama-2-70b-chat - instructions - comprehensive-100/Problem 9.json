Identify the conversion factor: 40 miles/inch\n2. Convert 1 inch to miles: 1 inch = 40 miles/inch\n3. Multiply the length of the road in inches by the conversion factor: 20 inches x 40 miles/inch = 800 miles\nDouble-checking my calculations, I can see that my answer is correct.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
