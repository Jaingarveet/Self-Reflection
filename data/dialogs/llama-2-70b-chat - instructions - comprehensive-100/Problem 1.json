Let's try to solve this problem again.\n\nThe monthly salary S of a shop assistant is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. We need to find the monthly sales so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.\n\nThe equation to represent the problem is:\nS = 500 + (0.05) x Sales\n\nWe want S to be equal to $1500, so we can set up the equation as follows:\n1500 = 500 + (0.05) x Sales\n\nNow, let's solve for Sales:\n1000 = (0.05) x Sales\n\nSales = 1000 / (0.05)\nSales = 20,000\n\nTherefore, the monthly sales should be $20,000 so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
