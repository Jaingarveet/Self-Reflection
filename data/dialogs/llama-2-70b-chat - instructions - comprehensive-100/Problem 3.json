        "content": "  Sure, I'll be happy to help you with that.\n\nLet X be the number of sales made.\nThe total amount of sales made would be 250X.\nThe total commission earned would be 10% of 250X = 25X.\nThe total salary earned would be 25X + 1000.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000, we can set up the equation:\n25X + 1000 ≥ 1000\n\nSubtracting 1000 from both sides gives us:\n25X ≥ 0\n\nDividing both sides by 25 gives us:\nX ≥ 0\n\nSince X has to be a whole number, the minimum number of sales required to reach a salary of at least $1000 is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 15.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
