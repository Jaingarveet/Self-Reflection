        "content": "  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is choice E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The organizer cannot select more than four French works, so they must select at least one Russian novel.\n2. The organizer must select at least three novels, and they cannot select more than four French novels. Therefore, they must select at least one Russian novel.\n3. The organizer must select at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Therefore, if they select two French novels, they must also select two Russian novels.\n4. If the organizer selects both French plays, they cannot select the Russian play. Therefore, the Russian play must be selected if the organizer selects only one play.\n\nGiven these constraints, the only possible selection that satisfies all the requirements is:\n\n* Two French novels\n* Two Russian novels\n* One French play\n* One Russian play\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice E: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further mistake."
