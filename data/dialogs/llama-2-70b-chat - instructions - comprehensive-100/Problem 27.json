Read the question carefully and ensure a clear understanding of the conditions set for the service targets.\n2. Evaluate each answer choice based on the conditions provided.\n3. Select the answer choice that cannot be set for more than one client.\n\nMy previous answer was incorrect, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the conditions set for the service targets. I mistakenly chose answer choice A, a 1-day website target, assuming that it would be the most restrictive target. However, upon re-evaluating the conditions, I realized that the correct answer is answer choice C, a 2-day website target.\n\nThe conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, if a client has a 2-day website target, their voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image cannot have a 2-day website target. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide cannot have a 2-day website target either.\n\nTherefore, the only client that can have a 2-day website target is Truvest. However, since Truvest's website target must be longer than Image's voicemail target, Truvest cannot have a 2-day website target. Thus, a 2-day website target CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients, making answer choice C the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
