Choose the answer that best completes the text.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe text suggests that the best way to avoid ATM fees is to use an ATM associated with your bank. The correct answer choice should mention something about learning the locations of ATMs associated with your bank.\n\nChoice B states, \"Try to learn where atms associated with your bank are located.\" This matches the solution of using an ATM associated with your bank and is the best answer choice.\n\nThe other answer choices do not match the solution of using an ATM associated with your bank and are therefore incorrect.\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question. I thought the answer was D, but upon reflection, I realized that D does not match the solution of using an ATM associated with your bank.\n\nI then re-read the question and understood that the correct answer should mention something about learning the locations of ATMs associated with your bank. I chose B, which matches the solution and is the correct answer."
