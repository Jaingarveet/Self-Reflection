I mistakenly chose option D, Salicylic acid, which is actually a commonly used agent in chemical peeling.\n\nTo correctly answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Review the list of commonly used agents in chemical peeling: Glycolic acid, Kojic acid, Phenol, and Salicylic acid.\n2. Ensure I understand the properties and uses of each agent:\n\t* Glycolic acid: An alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells, revealing smoother, brighter skin.\n\t* Kojic acid: A natural compound that inhibits melanin production, often used to lighten skin and reduce pigmentation.\n\t* Phenol: A strong agent that can remove both the outer layer and the middle layer of skin, used for deeper peels.\n\t* Salicylic acid: A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that exfoliates the skin, unclogs pores, and reduces inflammation.\n3. Carefully read the question and choices:\nThe question asks which option is not an agent used in chemical peeling.\n4. Eliminate any answer choices that do not match the description in the question:\n\t* Option D, Salicylic acid, is a commonly used agent in chemical peeling, so it cannot be the correct answer.\n5. Choose the correct answer:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is Phenol. Phenol is a strong agent that can remove both the outer layer and the middle layer of skin, used for deeper peels. It is not a commonly used agent in chemical peeling, unlike the other options."
