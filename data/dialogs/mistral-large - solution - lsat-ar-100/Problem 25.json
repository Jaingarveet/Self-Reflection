Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If G is fourth, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fifth.\n  B: J is first.\n  C: Q is second.\n  D: S is fifth\n  E: Y is sixth.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nIf G is fourth, then J must be earlier than G, so J can be first, second, or third.\nIf J is first, then the second article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the second article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the second article cannot be Y. Therefore, the second article must be Q.\nIf J is second, then the first article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the first article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the first article cannot be Y. Therefore, the first article must be Q.\nIf J is third, then the first and second articles cannot be about finance, so they must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the first and second articles cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the first and second articles cannot be Y. Therefore, the first and second articles must be Q and S, in that order.\nIn all cases, the fifth article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the fifth article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Q, the fifth article cannot be Q. Therefore, the fifth article must be Y.\n"
