Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If J is third, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is fourth\n  B: His sixth\n  C: Q is first\n  D: S is second\n  E: Y is fifth\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nIf J is third, then the first two articles cannot be finance articles, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, the first two articles must be either nutrition or wildlife articles.\nIf S is earlier than Q, then S cannot be first, as S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. Therefore, S must be second.\nIf [REDACTED], then the first article must be a nutrition article, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, Q must be first.\nIf [REDACTED], then the fourth article cannot be a nutrition article, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, G cannot be fourth.\nIf J is earlier than G, and G is earlier than R, then R cannot be earlier than J. Therefore, R cannot be fifth.\nIf S is earlier than Y, then Y cannot be earlier than S. However, Y can still be fifth, as there is no condition that prevents it from being so.\n"
