Specifically, I overlooked the rule that \"L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\"\n\nSolution:\nSince J must be shown in the evening, it cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon. Therefore, the first two houses shown in the morning cannot be J, and the three houses shown in the afternoon cannot be J.\n\nSince K cannot be shown in the morning, it must be shown either in the afternoon or evening. However, since L must be shown after K and before M, and there are only two houses shown in the evening (J and one other), K cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon.\n\nSince L must be shown after K and before M, and K is shown in the afternoon, L cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, L must be shown either in the afternoon or evening. However, since there are only two houses shown in the evening (J and one other), and M cannot be shown in the evening (because L must be shown before M), L must be shown in the afternoon.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"B: L is shown in the afternoon.\"\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
