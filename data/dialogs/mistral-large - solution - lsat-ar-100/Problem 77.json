        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the rules given:\n\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nFrom rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).\n\nNow, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).\n\nHowever, we must also consider rule 2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. Since Robertson can only occupy one of the [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces, and Young and Togowa must occupy [REDACTED] of the remaining [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces, Souza can only be assigned the remaining lower-numbered space (#1, #2, or #3). This means that Xu can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining higher-numbered spaces (#5 or #6).\n"
