Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made?\nChoices:\n  A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  B: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\n  C: oatmeal: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday\n  D: oatmeal: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday peanut butter: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n  E: oatmeal: Monday, Thursday, Friday peanut butter: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, as the first batch of oatmeal cookies is already made on Monday.\nThe second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Thursday, as only one batch of each kind of cookie is made on a single day.\nTherefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.\nThe first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, as it is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.\nThe second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Friday.\nThe third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Tuesday.\nThe third batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Thursday.\nThe first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday, as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. It also cannot be made on Wednesday, as the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. Therefore, it must be made on Monday.\nThe third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, Thursday, or Friday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Wednesday.\n"
