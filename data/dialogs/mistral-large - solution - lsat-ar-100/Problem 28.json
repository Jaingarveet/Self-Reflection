The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we need to select a botanist, a chemist, and a zoologist.\nWe already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R).\nSince more than one botanist is not allowed if more than one zoologist is selected, we cannot select another botanist.\nSince F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected, we cannot select [REDACTED].\nSince [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected, we cannot select [REDACTED].\nSince [REDACTED] is not selected, we do not need to select both [REDACTED] and R.\nTherefore, the only remaining option is another zoologist.\n"
