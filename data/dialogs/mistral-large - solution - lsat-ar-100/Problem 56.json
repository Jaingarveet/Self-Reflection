Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, Zone 1 must have at least 4 sales representatives.\n\nIf Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 2, and since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 2 can only have 2 sales representatives. This leaves only one sales representative for Zone 1, which contradicts the condition that Zone 1 must have at least 4 sales representatives. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.\n\nIf Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 2, and since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 2 can only have 2 sales representatives. This leaves only one sales representative for Zone 1, which contradicts the condition that Zone 1 must have at least 4 sales representatives. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.\n\nIf Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3. This means that there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.\n\nSince Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Parra cannot work in Zone 3, Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 either. This means that either Kim or Mahr must work in Zone 2.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI initially answered this question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. I thought this meant that Zone 3 must have at least 4 sales representatives, which led me to incorrectly eliminate some of the answer choices. After reflecting on the problem and the correct answer, I realized that Zone 3 can have exactly 3 sales representatives, as long as Zone 2 has only 2 sales representatives. This allowed me to correctly eliminate the answer choices and select the correct answer."
