        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Key information:\n   - Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week\n   - His car averages 25 miles per gallon\n   - Gasoline costs $4 per gallon\n   - Alan wants to reduce his weekly gas expenditure by $5\n   - We need to find how many fewer miles (m) he should drive\n2. The unknown variable is m, representing the number of miles Alan should reduce his driving by each week.\n3. Let's set up the equation:\n   - Currently, Alan drives 100 miles, and 100 miles ÷ 25 miles/gallon = 4 gallons used per week\n   - So his current weekly cost is 4 gallons × $4/gallon = $16\n   - If he reduces his driving by m miles, he'll use (100 - m) ÷ 25 gallons\n   - The cost will be ((100 - m) ÷ 25) × $4\n   - We want this new cost to be $5 less than the current cost of $16\n4. Equation: ((100 - m) ÷ 25) × $4 = $16 - $5\n5. Simplify: (4 - (4m ÷ 100)) × $4 = $11\n            16 - (16m ÷ 100) = $11\n            16 - (16m ÷ 100) = 11\n            16m ÷ 100 = 5\n            16m = 500\n            m = 500 ÷ 16 = 31.25 miles\n6. Therefore, Alan needs to reduce his driving by about 31.25 miles per week to save $5.\n7. Looking at the choices, (4/25)m = 5 matches our simplified equation of 16m ÷ 100 = 5.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
