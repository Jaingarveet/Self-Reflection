Identify the base number and the exponent.\n2. If the exponent is a fraction, rewrite the expression according to the properties of exponents: $(a^{\\frac{m}{n}}) = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\\frac{1}{n}})^m$.\n3.

The exponent is a fraction, so we rewrite the expression:\n   $9^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (\\sqrt[4]{9})^3 = (9^{\\frac{1}{4}})^3$\n3. Simplify the inner expression $9^{\\frac{1}{4}}$:\n   $9^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt[4]{9} = \\sqrt{3}$\n   \n   This is because $\\sqrt[4]{9} = 9^{\\frac{1}{4}} = (3^2)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 3^{\\frac{2}{4}} = 3^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{3}$\n4. Now, raise the simplified inner expression to the power of 3 (the numerator of the original exponent):\n   $(\\sqrt{3})^3 = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 3\\sqrt{3}$\n5. The resulting expression $3\\sqrt{3}$ cannot be simplified further.\n6. Looking at the answer choices, the expression $3\\sqrt{3}$ matches choice D.\nTherefore, the answer is D: $3\\sqrt{3}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
