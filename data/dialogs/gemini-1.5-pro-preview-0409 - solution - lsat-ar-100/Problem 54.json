The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the constraints.  \n## Answering the Question:\n1. **Jiang and Tamerlane:** We know Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane, and Kramer and O'Neill do. So, Tamerlane is covered.\n2. **Megregian's Reviews:** Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Since Kramer reviews Tamerlane, Megregian must review at least two plays. \n3. **Lopez and Megregian:** Neither reviews the same play as Jiang. Since Jiang doesn't review Tamerlane, and Megregian reviews at least two plays, Megregian **must review both Sunset and Undulation**.\n4. **Two Students with Same Reviews:** Since Megregian reviews both remaining plays, the two students with the same reviews must be Kramer and O'Neill, meaning they both **only review Tamerlane**. \n5. **Jiang's Remaining Review:** With Tamerlane and Undulation covered, Jiang's remaining review **must be Sunset**.\nTherefore, based on the given conditions and deductions, **Jiang reviews Sunset**. \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
