It's crucial to systematically analyze each option against all the conditions to ensure it fully complies.\n**Key Learnings:**\n* **Methodical Approach:** Each option needs to be checked against all the given conditions, not just a subset. \n* **Constraint Focus:** Pay close attention to the limiting conditions, such as the maximum number of French works or the relationship between French and Russian novels.\n**Improved Strategy:**\n1. **List the Constraints:** Clearly list out all the conditions mentioned in the problem.\n2. **Analyze Each Option:** Go through each option and compare it against the list of constraints. Eliminate options that violate any of the conditions.\n3. **Verify Remaining Options:** Double-check the remaining options to ensure they satisfy all the conditions before selecting the answer. \n**Applying the Improved Strategy:**\nLet's analyze each option:\n* **A:** This option violates the constraint of having at least 3 novels. \n* **B:** This option violates two constraints: having a maximum of 4 French works and the condition related to selecting both French plays.\n* **C:** This option violates the constraint of having at least one Russian novel if both French plays are selected.\n* **D:** This option violates the constraint of having a maximum of 4 French works.\n* **E:** This option satisfies all the given constraints: \n    * It has 5 works in total.\n    * It has 3 French works and 2 Russian works, complying with the limit on French works and the requirement for at least as many French novels as Russian novels.\n    * It has 3 novels in total.\n    * It doesn't violate the condition related to selecting both French plays.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **E**.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
