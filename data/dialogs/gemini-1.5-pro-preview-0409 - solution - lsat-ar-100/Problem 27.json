We need to check if it allows for another pair with identical reviews and unique combinations for the rest.\n* **C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill:** This contradicts the condition that Kramer and O'Neill are the pair reviewing Tamerlane.\n* **D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill:** This contradicts the given information that Kramer and O'Neill are the pair reviewing Tamerlane.\n* **E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill:** This contradicts the given information that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B allows for Kramer and O'Neill to be the pair with identical reviews (Tamerlane) and leaves room for the other three students to have unique combinations of the remaining two plays.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
