Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

However, I can still analyze the problem step-by-step and provide the best possible answer based on the given context and constraints. \n## Analyzing the Parking Space Assignment:\n1. **Robertson's Constraint:**  Must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, and must have a higher number than Young. This leaves only two possibilities for Robertson: **#3 or #4**.\n2. **Young & Togowa Constraint:** Young must have a higher number than Togowa. Since Robertson takes either #3 or #4, and Young needs a higher number, this leaves only **#5 or #6** for Young. Consequently, Togowa is limited to **#1 or #2**.\n3. **Xu & Souza Constraint:** Xu needs a higher number than Souza. We don't have enough information to pinpoint their exact spaces, but they will fill the remaining two spots (either #1 & #2 or #5 & #6) depending on the final placement of Robertson and Young. \n4. **Vaughn:** Has no constraints and will take the last remaining spot.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, **three employees (Robertson, Young, and Togowa) have only two possible parking space options each**. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
