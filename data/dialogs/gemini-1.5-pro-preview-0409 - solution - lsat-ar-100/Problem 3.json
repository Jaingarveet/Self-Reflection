Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the specific rule about Robertson's parking space assignment (#1-4) and neglected the cascading effects of other rules. Assigning Robertson to #3 does narrow down possibilities, but it's crucial to analyze how this choice impacts the placement of other employees based on the given rules.\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Robertson is in #3:** This satisfies the rule about Robertson's parking space being #1-4.\n2. **Young must be higher than Togowa:** Since Robertson is in #3, and Young needs a higher number than Robertson, Young must be in #4, #5, or #6. This leaves #1 and #2 for Togowa and Souza (their order doesn't matter yet).\n3. **Xu must be higher than Souza:** Since Souza can only be in #1 or #2, Xu must be in #4, #5, or #6. \n4. **Combining information:** We know Young and Xu both need spaces #4, #5, or #6. However, there are only two spaces left (since Robertson is in #3). \nTherefore, **Vaughn must be assigned parking space #5** to allow both Young and Xu to have higher-numbered spaces (#4 and #6, order doesn't matter).\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
