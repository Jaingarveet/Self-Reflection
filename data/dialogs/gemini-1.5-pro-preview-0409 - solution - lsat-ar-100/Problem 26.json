Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: What is the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece?\nChoices:\n  A: zero\n  B: one\n  C: two\n  D: three\n  E: four\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

If modern, Zara plays it.\n* **From 5:** This eliminates some sequencing options depending on who plays second.\n**Minimizing Wayne's Traditional Solos:**\nTo minimize Wayne's traditional pieces, we should explore scenarios where Zara plays the second traditional piece.\n**Scenario 1:**\n* **Second Solo:** Zara (Traditional) \n* **Third Solo:**  (Traditional) -  This satisfies the consecutive condition.\n* **Fourth Solo:**  Wayne (Modern) -  Following constraint 3 and ensuring Wayne plays modern before traditional.\n* **Fifth Solo:** Wayne/Zara (Modern/Traditional) -  Either option works as long as it's not Zara.\nIn this scenario, Wayne plays **one** traditional piece (potentially the fifth).\n**Scenario 2:**\n* **Second Solo:** Wayne (Modern)\n* **Third Solo:**  (Traditional)\n* **Fourth Solo:** Zara (Modern) \n* **Fifth Solo:** Wayne (Traditional)\nThis scenario also results in Wayne playing **one** traditional piece.\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth valid scenarios lead to Wayne playing a minimum of **one** traditional piece. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
