So, H and M being together is not possible.\n* **D:** I is on the middle shelf, and G could be there too, satisfying the condition.\n* **E:** We don't have enough information to determine if K and O are on the same shelf.\nTherefore, considering the possibilities and constraints, the only option that must be true is:\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
