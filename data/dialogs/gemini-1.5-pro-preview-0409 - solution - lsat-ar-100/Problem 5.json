This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the given information. \n## New Approach:\nThis time, I will focus on analyzing the relationships between the books and shelves, paying close attention to the \"higher/lower shelf\" conditions and the constraint of at least two books per shelf.\n**Analyzing the Conditions:**\n* **More books on bottom than top:** This means at least 3 books are on the bottom shelf and a maximum of 2 books can be on the top shelf.\n* **I is on the middle shelf:** This leaves 7 books to be distributed between the top and bottom shelves.\n* **K is higher than F:** This means K cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n* **O is higher than L:** Similar to K, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n* **F is on the same shelf as M:** This pair can be on either the top or bottom shelf.\n**Deductions:**\n* Since K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf, **F and M must be on the bottom shelf.**\n* This leaves I on the middle shelf and K, O, G, L on the top shelf.\n* From the given conditions, we know **O is higher than L** but we don't have enough information to determine the relative positions of K and G, or I and F.\nTherefore, the only statement that **must be true** is:\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
