However, I can still analyze the problem and provide the correct answer based on the given context and conditions.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Botanists:** Since both G and H are selected (two botanists), we can only have **at most one zoologist**.\n2. **Chemists:** \n    * **F and K cannot both be selected**: Since we have G and H (botanists), F cannot be selected. This means **K can be selected**.\n    * **K and M cannot both be selected**: This means if K is selected, M cannot be, and vice versa.\n3. **Zoologists:**\n    * **If M is selected, both P and R must be selected**: However, we can only have at most one zoologist due to having two botanists (G and H). So, **M cannot be selected**.\n## Conclusion:\n* **K can be selected** as F is not allowed with G and H.\n* **M cannot be selected** due to the limitation on the number of zoologists and the condition requiring both P and R with M.\nTherefore, the panel must include either **K or M**.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
