Levodopa is a drug that increases dopamine levels in the brain, not cholinergic activity.\n2. Benserazide is a drug that increases dopamine levels in the brain, not cholinergic activity.\n3. Selegiline is a drug that acts by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, not decreasing cholinergic activity.\n4. Biperiden is a drug that acts by decreasing brain cholinergic activity.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the mechanism of action of each anti-Parkinson drug.\n2. Pay close attention to the specific action of each drug.\n3. Ensure that you understand the difference between increasing dopamine levels and decreasing cholinergic activity.\n4. Double-check your answer by reviewing the drug's mechanism of action.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review the mechanism of action of a drug before answering a question.\n* Pay close attention to the specific action of each drug.\n* Use flashcards or other memory aids to help you remember the mechanism of action of different drugs.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the drug's mechanism of action.\n* Practice, practice, practice! The more you practice, the more comfortable you will become with the mechanisms of action of different drugs.\n"
