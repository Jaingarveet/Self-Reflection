However, \"senescent RBCs\" actually refers to red blood cells that are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the term \"senescent RBCs\"\n* Lack of knowledge about the characteristics of different types of malaria\n\nSolution:\nSenescent RBCs are mainly attacked in Quartan malaria, which is caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite. Quartan malaria is characterized by a 72-hour cycle of fever and chills, and it is more commonly found in temperate regions.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the type of malaria that is characterized by a 72-hour cycle of fever and chills.\n2. Recognize that senescent RBCs are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.\n3. Associate Quartan malaria with the attack on senescent RBCs.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always ensure a thorough understanding of the terminology used in the question.\n* Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of different types of malaria, including their symptoms and the parasites that cause them.\n* Pay attention to the details provided in the question and use them to guide your answer.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the information provided in the question and the relevant knowledge you have on the topic.\n"
