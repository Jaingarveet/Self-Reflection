I thought that necrosis was caused by the efflux of calcium ions from the cell, but it is actually caused by enzymatic digestion.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of cell death mechanisms\n* Necrosis vs. apoptosis\n* Enzymatic digestion vs. calcium efflux\n\nSolution:\nNecrosis is a type of cell death that occurs due to injury, infection, or other forms of cellular stress. One of the hallmarks of necrosis is the disruption of cell membrane integrity, which can lead to the release of intracellular enzymes into the extracellular space. These enzymes can then break down the cell's own components, leading to the death of the cell. Therefore, the correct answer is choice D, enzymatic digestion.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the mechanisms of cell death, including necrosis and apoptosis.\n2. Understand the difference between necrosis and apoptosis.\n3. Recognize that necrosis is caused by enzymatic digestion, not calcium efflux.\n4. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n5. Double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review the basics of a topic before moving on to more advanced concepts.\n* Understand the differences between similar concepts, such as necrosis and apoptosis.\n* Pay attention to key words and phrases in the question to help guide your answer.\n* Double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\n* Seek out resources, such as textbooks or online forums, to help clarify any misunderstandings.\n"
