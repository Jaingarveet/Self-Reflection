Review the branching pattern of the external carotid artery and its branches.\n2. Study the anatomy of the maxillary artery and its branches.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the course and distribution of the middle meningeal artery.\n4. Practice identifying the branches of the external carotid artery and the maxillary artery.\n5.
