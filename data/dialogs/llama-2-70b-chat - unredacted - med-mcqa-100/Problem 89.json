Read the question carefully and understand the condition being discussed.\n2. Eliminate any options that are not relevant to the condition.\n3. Choose the option that is least relevant to the condition.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the condition being discussed.\n- Use your knowledge of the condition to eliminate unnecessary options.\n- Double-check your answer by re-reading the question and options.\n- In diagnostic investigations, consider the specific modality and its ability to visualize the relevant structures.\n- In spondylolisthesis, X-rays and CT scans are more useful than MRI.\n"
