        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe cobra snake head appearance is a characteristic feature of ureterocele, not posterior urethral valve, as I previously misunderstood. Ureterocele is a condition where the ureter enters the bladder in a dilated, tortuous manner, resembling the head of a cobra snake. This radiological feature helps distinguish ureterocele from other conditions such as posterior urethral valve. It is essential to carefully read the options, associate the radiological feature with the correct condition, and double-check answers to avoid mistakes.\n\nError Keywords (optional):\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Radiological feature confusion\n* Posterior urethral valve\n* Ureterocele\n\nInstructions (optional):\n\n1.
