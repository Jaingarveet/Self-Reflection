In aerobic glycolysis, the end product is indeed lactic acid, but in anaerobic glycolysis, the end product is actually 2 ATP and 2 NADH.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Confusion\n* Metabolism\n* Glycolysis\n\nSolution:\nAnaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen and involves the breakdown of glucose to produce energy. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP and 2 NADH, which are produced when glucose is converted to pyruvate and then pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the steps of anaerobic glycolysis.\n2. Identify the end product of anaerobic glycolysis.\n3. Recall that in anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the end product of anaerobic glycolysis.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review the steps of metabolic pathways to ensure understanding.\n* Be familiar with the different end products of aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis.\n* Pay attention to the conditions under which each process occurs.\n* Double-check your answers to ensure they match the end product of the process.\n"
