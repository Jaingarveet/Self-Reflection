Option A contains the recommended dosage of 100 mg of iron and 500 mcg of folic acid, aligning with the WHO recommendations.

This dosage does not align with the WHO recommendations, and I should have carefully evaluated each option before selecting an answer.\n\nReflecting on my mistake, I realized that relying solely on memory without fully reading the question and considering the options led to my error. Additionally, I misapplied my knowledge of the WHO recommendations by not verifying the dosages in each option.\n\nTo avoid similar mistakes, it's essential to read the question carefully and thoroughly, use knowledge and information provided in the question to answer correctly, verify the dosages of medications or supplements before selecting an answer, and double-check the answer for accuracy. Healthcare providers should be consulted to determine the appropriate dosage of iron and folic acid supplements for individual patients."
