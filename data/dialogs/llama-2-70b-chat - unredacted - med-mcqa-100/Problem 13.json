I thought that CT scan was the most appropriate choice, but I failed to consider the fact that USG is more commonly used as a first-line imaging modality for pyloric stenosis.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Modality confusion\n* Misunderstanding of imaging indications\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Review the imaging modalities and their indications for pyloric stenosis.\n2. Understand that USG is the initial imaging modality of choice for pyloric stenosis.\n3. Recognize that CT scan is a more invasive and expensive modality that should be used when USG is equivocal or when there are other indications for its use.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the clinical presentation and symptoms of pyloric stenosis.\n2. Understand the role of imaging in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis.\n3. Familiarize yourself with the imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, including USG, UGI, CT, and MRI.\n4. Practice using case scenarios to differentiate between the imaging modalities and their indications.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review the clinical presentation and symptoms of a condition before considering imaging modalities.\n* Understand the advantages and limitations of each imaging modality.\n* Use case scenarios to practice differentiating between imaging modalities and their indications.\n* Consider seeking feedback from a radiologist or an expert in the field to improve your understanding of imaging modalities and their indications.\n"
