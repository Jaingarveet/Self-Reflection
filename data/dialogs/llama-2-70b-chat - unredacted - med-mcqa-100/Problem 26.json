I knew that flexion and extension in the neck occur at the Atlanto-axial joint, but I mistakenly identified the wrong joint.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Joint confusion\n* Anatomy mistake\n* Neck joints\n\nSolution:\nFlexion and extension in the neck occur at the Atlanto-occipital joint. This joint is between the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone. It allows for the nodding movement of the head.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the joint that allows for the nodding movement of the head.\n2. Recall the location of the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone.\n3. Associate the Atlanto-occipital joint with the correct movement.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Review the anatomy of the neck joints to avoid confusion.\n* Pay close attention to the specific movement associated with each joint.\n* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or illustrations, to help reinforce your understanding.\n* Practice identifying the different joints and their associated movements to build confidence.\n"
