I thought the cells were transplanted into the liver, but the correct answer is that they are injected into the portal vein.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Portal vein\n* Liver\n\nSolution:\nIslet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus involves transplanting islet cells from a donor pancreas into a recipient with type 1 diabetes. The transplanted cells can produce insulin, regulating the recipient's blood sugar levels. The transplantation site should provide adequate blood supply and minimize the risk of immune rejection.\n\nThe correct answer is \"B: Injected into the portal vein\". Islet cells are typically injected into the portal vein, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. This site allows the islet cells to mix with the blood supply and distribute throughout the body, reducing the risk of rejection and promoting their survival.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Understand the concept of islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus.\n2. Identify the correct site of transplantation for islet cells.\n3. Eliminate incorrect answer choices.\n4. Choose the correct answer, \"B: Injected into the portal vein\".\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always understand the question and the underlying concept.\n* Be familiar with the anatomy and physiology of the relevant organ systems.\n* Pay attention to detail and avoid simple mistakes.\n* Use a systematic approach to eliminate incorrect answer choices.\n* Double-check your answer before submitting.\n"
