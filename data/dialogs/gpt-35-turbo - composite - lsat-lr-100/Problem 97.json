        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?\nChoices:\n  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.\n  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.\n  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.\n  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.\n  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the role of the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. \nThe statement is not a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion. Instead, it is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Role confusion\n - Premise misidentification\nSolution:\nThe editorial argues that cell-phone usage on airplanes is ill-advised because it would be more upsetting than on buses and trains. \nThe statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument's structure.\n2. Identify the main conclusion of the argument.\n3. Identify the premises that support the main conclusion.\n4. Identify the role of each premise in the argument.\n5. Identify the conclusion that supports the main conclusion.\n6. Identify the role of each conclusion in the argument.\n7. Choose the answer that best describes the role of the statement in question.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument's structure.\n - Always identify the main conclusion of the argument.\n - Always identify the premises that support the main conclusion.\n - Always identify the role of each premise in the argument.\n - Always identify the conclusion that supports the main conclusion.\n - Always identify the role of each conclusion in the argument.\n - Be careful not to misinterpret the argument's structure or the role of its components.\n"
