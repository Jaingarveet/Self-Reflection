In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.\nQuestion: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.\n  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.\n  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.\n  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.\n  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misidentified the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above. The argument uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called \"hasty generalization,\" which draws a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence. \nOption [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it also uses a hasty generalization by assuming that most people in Highland County drive sedans based on the fact that most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. \nError Keywords:\n - Misidentification of the flawed pattern of reasoning\n - Hasty generalization\nSolution:\nThe argument above uses a flawed pattern of reasoning called \"hasty generalization,\" which draws a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence. \nOption [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it also uses a hasty generalization by assuming that most people in Highland County drive sedans based on the fact that most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the argument carefully and identify the pattern of reasoning used.\n2. Read each option and identify the pattern of reasoning used in each.\n3. Compare the pattern of reasoning used in each option to the pattern of reasoning used in the argument.\n4. Choose the option that uses a pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the argument carefully and identify the pattern of reasoning used.\n - Always read each option carefully and identify the pattern of reasoning used in each.\n - Always compare the pattern of reasoning used in each option to the pattern of reasoning used in the argument.\n - Remember that there are many different patterns of reasoning that can be flawed, so be familiar with them.\n"
