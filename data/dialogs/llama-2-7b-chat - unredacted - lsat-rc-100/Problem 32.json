        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as \"literature\" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique \"voices\" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.\nQuestion: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?\nChoices:\n  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.\n  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.\n  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.\n  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.\n  E: Though he composed and condueted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nGreat, let's break down the passage and analyze the information provided to determine the correct answer:\n\nThe passage mentions Duke Ellington in the context of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, and how Morrison has found a way to create a sense of ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. The author, Robert O'Meally, highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.\n\nThe passage does not provide any explicit credit to Ellington for inspiring Morrison's style of narration. While it is mentioned that Ellington perfected the art of composition, particularly in the context of jazz, there is no mention of him inspiring Morrison's narrative style. Therefore, option A is not supported by the passage.\n\nB: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.\n\nThe passage does not provide any information to suggest that Ellington prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos. In fact, the passage highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. This suggests that Ellington was not opposed to lengthy solos or improvisations, but rather, he had a deliberate approach to composition that allowed for both individual expression and collective unity. Therefore, option B is the best answer.\n\nC: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.\n\nThe passage does not mention Ellington as a minor character in Morrison's Jazz. In fact, the passage highlights his significance as a genius of music who perfected the art of composition, particularly in the context of jazz. Therefore, option C is not supported by the passage.\n\nD: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he conducted.\n\nThe passage does not provide any information to suggest that Ellington composed music specifically for the musicians he conducted. In fact, the passage highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. This suggests that Ellington's compositions were not specifically tailored to any particular musician, but rather, he allowed for individual expression within the framework of his compositions. Therefore, option D is not supported by the passage.\n\nE: Though he composed and conducted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.\n\nThe passage does not provide any information about Ellington's compositional style beyond jazz. While it is mentioned that Ellington perfected the art of composition, particularly in the context of jazz, there is no mention of him composing music of other genres. Therefore, option E is not supported by the passage.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option B: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.\n"
