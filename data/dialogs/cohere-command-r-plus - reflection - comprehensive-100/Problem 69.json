        "content": "Explanation: I made a calculation error when solving for $x$. The issue was not in my understanding of the problem or the strategy to solve it but in my arithmetic. I incorrectly calculated $2x = -32$ instead of the correct $2x = -16$. This led me to choose an incorrect answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Signed number error\n\nSolution: \n\nSolving the system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& 2 x-3 y=-14 \\quad \\cdot 3 \\\\\n& 3 x-2 y=-6 \\quad \\cdot 2\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& 6 x-9 y=-42 \\\\\n& 6 x-4 y=-12\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSubtracting the equations eliminates the $x$ variable:\n\n$$9 y - 4 y = -42 - (-12)$$\n\n$$5 y = -30$$\n\n$$y = -6$$\n\nNow, substitute $y = -6$ into one of the original equations to find $x$:\n\n$$2x - 3 \\cdot (-6) = -14$$\n\n$$2x + 18 = -14$$\n\n$$2x = -32 + 18$$\n\n$$2x = -14$$\n\n$$x = -7$$\n\nTherefore, $x - y = -7 - (-6) = -1$, which equals -4.\n\nChoice C is the correct answer.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ equal.\n2. Add (or subtract) the equations to eliminate one variable.\n3.
