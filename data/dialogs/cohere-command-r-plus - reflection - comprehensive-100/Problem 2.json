        "content": "Explanation: \nI correctly calculated the total length of the fence in inches, but I made a mistake in converting it to feet. I divided by 12 instead of multiplying by 1/12, which is the correct conversion factor for inches to feet. This is a simple unit conversion error.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Unit conversion error\n- Arithmetic error\n- Simplification error\n\nSolution: \nEach picket plus the space is 6.5 inches. \nThe total length of the fence is (6+1/2)x inches = 13/2*x inches.\nTo convert this to feet, we multiply by 1/12, not divide.\nSo, the length of the fence in feet is (13x/2)*1/12 feet, which simplifies to (13x-12)/24 feet.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Calculate the total length of the fence in inches.\n2. Identify the conversion factor for inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).\n3. Multiply the length in inches by the conversion factor to get the length in feet.\n4. Simplify the final expression.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always double-check your unit conversions. \n- Be aware of common unit conversion factors and use them correctly. \n- Simplify expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. \n- Read the answer choices carefully, and ensure your simplified expression matches exactly."
