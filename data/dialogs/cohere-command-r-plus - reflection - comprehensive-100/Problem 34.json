        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\n\nThought: \nThe correct answer is D: that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. This assumption is necessary for the argument to make sense; if we don't assume that most employees currently have a short commute, then the fact that they will have a longer commute after the move loses its significance.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation: \nI focused too narrowly on the commute times and overlooked the financial aspect implied in the statement. \nI missed the critical keyword \"afford\" and its connection to the employees' ability to maintain their current commute times. \nError Keywords:\n- Overlooked financial context\n- Missed critical keyword\n- Narrow focus\n\nSolution: \nThe argument assumes that Acme employees will not receive a significant pay raise accompanying the move, which would enable them to afford housing closer to Ocean View and maintain a shorter commute. \nIf employees received a substantial pay raise, the argument's premise about their commute times would be invalid. \n\nInstructions: \n1. Identify the key premise of the argument: most employees will have longer commutes after the move. \n2. Recognize the condition required for this premise to hold true: employees' financial situation must remain largely unchanged. \n3. Understand that the absence of a significant pay raise ensures employees cannot afford housing for shorter commutes. \n4. Choose the answer option that reflects this absence of a pay raise. \n\nAdvice: \n - Consider the broader context and implications of the statement. \n - Pay attention to critical keywords that indicate necessary assumptions or conditions. \n - Ensure you understand the logical connections between premises and conclusions. \n - Think about potential counterarguments or alternative explanations. \n - Practice identifying underlying financial, social, or legal implications in arguments."
