Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST.\n2. Identify the relationship between the segments: U is the midpoint of ST.\n3. Calculate the length of UT since U is the midpoint: UT = ST / 2.\n4. Find the length of RU using the given information: RU = RT - UT.\n5. Double-check your calculations and the relationship between the segments.\n6.
