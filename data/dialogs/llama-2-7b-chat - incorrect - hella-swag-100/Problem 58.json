I selected option A, \"Go for paper that is thick and durable as you will be gluing them together.\" However, upon further reflection, I realize that option B, \"Choose paper that has no patterns or embellishments\" is the most likely completion to the text. This is because the author of the text specifically mentions that the paper should be smooth and free of hairs or wrinkles, which suggests that they want the paper to be plain and unadorned. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
