The correct answer is (B) Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes. This option is the most likely completion because it aligns with the information provided in the text. Applying calamine lotion or witch hazel to the chilblains and letting it sit for up to 5 minutes can help to ease the itchiness without scratching, which may result in an infection.\n\nAdditionally, option (D) Repeat this cycle every day for up to three days until the itch is gone, is not the most likely completion as it does not align with the information provided in the text. Scratching the chilblains may result in an infection, so it is important to find alternative methods to relieve the itchiness without resorting to scratching.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely completion to the text is (B) Let it sit on the itchy rash for up to 5 minutes."
