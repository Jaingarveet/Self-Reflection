[substeps] Do not microwave the wrap, or attempt to speed up the warming by heating it in any other fashion.\n\nReflection:\nNo reflection information provided.\n\nAnswer:\nThe most likely completion to the text is (B) [substeps] There are a few precautions you must take regarding opening the wrap before using a thermacare on your entire body when it is hot outside. You must also take steps: stand close to a wall with plenty of space in between the heat wrap and the wall and ceiling.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text explains that the chemical ingredients in thermacare wraps need to be exposed to air to activate. Therefore, it is important to unwrap the heat wrap thirty minutes before use to allow the ingredients to be exposed to air. Opening the wrap too early will limit its exposure to air, causing it to heat more slowly. Additionally, the text provides precautions to take when using the wrap, such as standing close to a wall and having space between the wrap and the wall and ceiling."
