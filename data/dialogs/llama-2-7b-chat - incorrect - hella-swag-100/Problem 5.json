I realized that the most likely completion to the text is that the swimmers will dive head to head into the water. This is because the text mentions the swimmer walking across the diving board alongside another swimmer, which suggests that they are preparing to dive into the water together. Additionally, the text does not provide any information that would suggest otherwise. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Dive head to head into the water."
