        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly determined that Young must be in space #1 or #2, and that Togowa must be in the other of those two spaces. However, I then incorrectly focused on the relationship between Xu and Souza, ignoring the key fact that Robertson was assigned space #3. Since Robertson is in space #3, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, Young must be assigned space #2 (since #1 is the only lower number than #3), and Togowa must therefore be assigned space #1.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Incomplete consideration of given information\n - Incorrect deduction\n - Overlooking key facts\nSolution:\nGiven:\n - Robertson is assigned parking space #3\n - Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson\n - Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young\nTherefore:\n - Young must be assigned parking space #2 (the only space lower than Robertson's #3)\n - Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 (the only space lower than Young's #2)\nSo the correct answer is E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the question and note any specific information given (e.g. Robertson is in space #3).\n2. Make a list of all the rules/constraints given in the question. \n3. Consider each rule one by one, noting what can be definitively determined from each.\n4. When a definite assignment can be made based on the given information, make that assignment.\n5. Continue working through the constraints logically until the question can be answered.\n6. If the question cannot be fully answered, determine what can be known for certain.\n7. Choose the answer choice that matches the definite determination.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question fully and carefully.\n - Always note and consider all given information; don't ignore key facts.\n - Always work through the logic step-by-step, considering each constraint in turn.\n - Always make definite assignments when the given information allows it.\n - Never make unsupported assumptions; only determine what can be known for certain.\n - If the question cannot be fully answered, determine what can be partially answered.\n - Always double-check your reasoning before selecting your final answer.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We are given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n2. The rules state:\n   - Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. \n   - Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young.\n   - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Since Robertson is in space #3, and Young must be in a lower space than Robertson, Young must be in either space #1 or #2.\n4. Since Togowa must be in a lower space than Young, and Young is in either #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the other of those two spaces.\n5. We can definitively say that Young is in space #2, because:\n   - If Young were in space #1, then there would be no lower space for Togowa.\n   - Therefore, Young must be in space #2, and Togowa must be in space #1.\n6. The question can be answered with the information given. We don't need to consider the placement of Xu and Souza to answer this specific question.\n7. The correct answer is E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
