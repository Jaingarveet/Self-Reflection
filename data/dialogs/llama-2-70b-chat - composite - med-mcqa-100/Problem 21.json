However, \"senescent RBCs\" actually refers to red blood cells that are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of the term \"senescent RBCs\"\n* Lack of knowledge about the characteristics of different types of malaria\n\nSolution:\nSenescent RBCs are mainly attacked in [REDACTED], which is caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite. [REDACTED] is characterized by a 72-hour cycle of fever and chills, and it is more commonly found in temperate regions.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the type of malaria that is characterized by a 72-hour cycle of fever and chills.\n2. Recognize that senescent RBCs are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.\n3. Associate [REDACTED] with the attack on senescent RBCs.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always ensure a thorough understanding of the terminology used in the question.\n* Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of different types of malaria, including their symptoms and the parasites that cause them.\n* Pay attention to the details provided in the question and use them to guide your answer.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the information provided in the question and the relevant knowledge you have on the topic.\n"
