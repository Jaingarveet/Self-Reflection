Review the key features of each type of glomerulonephritis, including [REDACTED], acute GN, membranous GN, and MPGN.\n2. Pay close attention to the specific characteristics of each disease, such as the presence of crescent-shaped deposits in MPGN and the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane in membranous nephropathy.\n3. Make sure to associate the correct pathological features with each disease.\n4. Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the available choices.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always review the key features of each disease before answering a question.\n- Pay close attention to the specific characteristics of each disease, such as the presence of crescent-shaped deposits or the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane.\n- Associate the correct pathological features with each disease.\n- Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the available choices.\n- Practice, practice, practice!
