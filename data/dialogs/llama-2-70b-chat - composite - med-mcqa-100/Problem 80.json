I was not familiar with the term \"duct papilloma\" and its association with nipple discharge. To avoid this mistake, I reviewed the different types of breast tumors and their symptoms, familiarized myself with the term \"duct papilloma\" and its association with nipple discharge, and understood the difference between benign and malignant tumors. Now, I know that duct papilloma is a benign tumor that originates in the lactiferous ducts of the breast and can cause nipple discharge. Therefore, the commonest cause of blood discharge from the nipple is duct papilloma.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the terminology used.\n- Familiarize yourself with different types of breast tumors and their symptoms.\n- Don't assume that all nipple discharge is due to malignancy.\n- Consider all options before answering.\n- Review your knowledge of breast tumors and their symptoms regularly."
