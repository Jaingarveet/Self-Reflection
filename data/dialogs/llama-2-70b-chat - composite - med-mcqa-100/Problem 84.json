        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is Brimonidine. Brimonidine works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, which is the main pathway for aqueous outflow from the eye. Timolol, Pilocarpine, and Brinzolamide all work by reducing the production of aqueous humor, not by increasing the outflow through the trabecular meshwork. Therefore, Brimonidine is the only medication that matches the description in the question.\n\nIn my previous answer, I confused the mechanism of action of Brimonidine with that of the other three medications. I mistakenly thought that Brimonidine worked by reducing the production of aqueous humor, like Timolol, Pilocarpine, and Brinzolamide. However, upon reflection, I realized that Brimonidine actually works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. This mistake highlights the importance of carefully reading the question and considering the specific mechanism of action of each medication before answering."
