To isolate P, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the fraction [r/1200 * (1 + r/1200)^N / ((1 + r/1200)^N - 1)]. The result is P = m / [r/1200 * (1 + r/1200)^N / ((1 + r/1200)^N - 1)]. This is equivalent to P = m * [(1 + r/1200)^N - 1] / [r/1200 * (1 + r/1200)^N], which is the reciprocal of the original fraction.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
