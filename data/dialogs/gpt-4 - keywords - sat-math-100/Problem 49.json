To solve for 'a', we need to equate the numerators and the denominators on both sides of the equation. \nThe numerator on the left side is 24x^2 + 25x - 47 and the numerator on the right side is -8x - 3. \nThe denominator on the left side is ax - 2 and the denominator on the right side is ax - 2. \nSince the denominators are already equal, we can equate the numerators:\n24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 3\nRearranging the equation gives:\n24x^2 + 33x - 44 = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:\nx = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\nSubstituting the values from the equation gives:\nx = [-33 ± sqrt((33)^2 - 4*24*(-44))] / 2*24\nSolving this gives two possible values for x, but since x ≠ 2/a, we can ignore the value that would make x = 2/a.\nTherefore, the value of 'a' is the one that does not make x = 2/a.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
