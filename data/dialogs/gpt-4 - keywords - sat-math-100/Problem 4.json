The slope is (k-0)/(2-0) = k/2. \nThe line also passes through the points (k, 32) and (0, 0), so the slope is also (32-0)/(k-0) = 32/k. \nSetting these two equal to each other gives k/2 = 32/k. Solving for k gives k^2 = 64, so k = 8 or k = -8. \nSince k is not negative in the choices, the answer is k = 8.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
