We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{3}{5} w &= \\frac{4}{3} \\\\\nw &= \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} \\\\\nw &= \\frac{20}{9}\n\\end{align*}\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the equation that needs to be solved.\n2. Determine which variable needs to be solved for.\n3. Identify the reciprocal of the coefficient of the variable.\n4. Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal.\n5. Simplify both sides of the equation.\n6. Solve for the variable.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the variable that needs to be solved for.\n - Always identify the reciprocal of the coefficient of the variable.\n - Always multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal.\n - Always simplify both sides of the equation.\n - Always solve for the variable.\n - Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n"
