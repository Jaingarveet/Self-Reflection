        "content": "Topic: Math\nQuestion: Katarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did. Based on Katarina's observation, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, how many pears did the Type B trees produce?\nChoices:\n  A: 115\n  B: 120\n  C: 124\n  D: 173\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI correctly identified that the number of pears produced by Type B trees is 20% less than Type A trees. However, I made a calculation error in finding the value of x. \nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Algebraic error\n - Percent decrease error\nSolution:\nLet's use the formula: \npercent decrease = (original number - new number) / original number x 100%\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100%\n20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100/1\n20 = (144 - x) / 1.44\n20 x 1.44 = 144 - x\n28.8 = 144 - x\nx = 144 - 28.8\nx = 115.2\nTherefore, the Type B trees produced 115.2 pears, which is closest to 120.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the percent increase or decrease between the two values.\n2. Use the percent decrease formula to set up the equation.\n3. Solve for the unknown value using algebraic manipulation.\n4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always use the correct formula for the given problem.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that percent decrease is calculated as (original number - new number) / original number x 100%.\n"
