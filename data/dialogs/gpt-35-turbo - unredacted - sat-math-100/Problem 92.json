Which of the following gives $P$ in terms of $m, r$, and $N$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $P=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1} m$\n  B: $P=\\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1}{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}} m$\n  C: $P=\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right) m$\n  D: $P=\\left(\\frac{1,200}{r}\\right) m$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly chose answer choice A because I did not distribute the $P$ correctly. \nThe correct answer is B because we need to isolate $P$ in the given formula. \nError Keywords:\n - Distribution error\n - Algebraic manipulation error\n - Isolation error\nSolution:\n$$m=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}}{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1} P$$\nWe need to isolate $P$ in the given formula.\nFirst, we can multiply both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side:\n$$m\\left(\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1\\right)=\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N} P$$\nNext, we can distribute $m$ on the left-hand side:\n$$m\\left(\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1\\right)=\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N} P$$\n$$m\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-m=\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N} P$$\nFinally, we can isolate $P$ by dividing both sides by $\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}$:\n$$P=\\frac{m\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-m}{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}}$$\n$$P=\\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}-1}{\\left(\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{r}{1,200}\\right)^{N}} m$$\nInstructions:\n1.
