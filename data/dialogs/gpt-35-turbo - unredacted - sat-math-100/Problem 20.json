What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?\nChoices:\n  A: -0.5\n  B: -0.25\n  C: 0.8\n  D: 1.75\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI chose the answer C, 0.8, because it appeared to be the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point on the graph. However, I did not read the graph accurately, and I made an error in my visual estimation. \nError Keywords:\n - Estimation error\n - Graphical error\n - Reading error\nSolution:\nTo find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations. We can use elimination or substitution to solve the system. Here, we will use elimination:\n$$\\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\\\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\\end{aligned}$$\nMultiplying the second equation by $3$ and adding it to the first equation, we get:\n$$\\begin{aligned}2.4 x-1.5 y+4.8 x+1.5 y&=0.3-3(1.3)\\\\6.8 x&=-3.6\\\\x&=-\\frac{18}{34}\\\\x&=-\\frac{9}{17}\\end{aligned}$$\nTherefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $-\\frac{9}{17}$, which is answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ -0.5}$.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and understand the question.\n2. Identify the system of equations and the unknown variable.\n3. Choose a method to solve the system of equations.\n4. Solve the system of equations step-by-step.\n5. Check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.\n6. Read the answer choices carefully and choose the correct answer.\n7. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and understand the question.\n - Always double-check your work and answer to ensure accuracy.\n - Always use a systematic approach to solve problems.\n - Always check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.\n - Remember that estimation is not a substitute for accurate calculation.\n"
