If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy algebraic setup was correct, but I made a mistake in solving the equations.\nThe correct setup of equations is:\n3x + 5 = n\n4x + 21 = n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\nx + 16 = 0\nx = -16\nSince the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.\nThe correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.\nn = 3x + 5\nn = 4x + 21\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n3x + 5 = 4x + 21\nx = 16\nTherefore, there are 16 students in the class.\nError Keywords:\n - Algebraic error\n - Calculation error\n - Equation solving error\nSolution:\nLet's use algebra to solve the problem.\nLet's assume there are 'x' students in the class.\nIf each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 3x milliliters.\nIf Mr. Kohl has 5 milliliters left over, then the total amount of solution he has is 3x + 5 milliliters.\nIf each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 4x milliliters.\nIf Mr. Kohl needs an additional 21 milliliters, then the total amount of solution he needs is 4x + 21 milliliters.\nWe can set up two equations using the above information and solve for 'x'.\n3x + 5 = n\n4x + 21 = n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get:\nx + 16 = 0\nx = -16\nSince the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.\nThe correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.\nn = 3x + 5\nn = 4x + 21\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n3x + 5 = 4x + 21\nx = 16\nTherefore, there are 16 students in the class.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the problem carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the unknown variable and assign a variable to it.\n3. Use algebra to set up equations based on the information given in the problem.\n4. Solve the equations for the unknown variable.\n5. Check the validity of the answer.\n6. If the answer is not valid, try a different approach.\n7. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the problem carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always assign a variable to the unknown quantity.\n - Always use algebra to set up equations based on the information given in the problem.\n - Always solve the equations for the unknown variable.\n - Always check the validity of the answer.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that a negative answer may not be valid in some problems.\n"
