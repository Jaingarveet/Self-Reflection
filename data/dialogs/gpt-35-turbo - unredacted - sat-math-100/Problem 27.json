Translate the problem into an equation.\n2. Simplify the equation.\n3. Solve for the variable.\n4. Substitute the value of the variable into the expression.\n5. Simplify the expression.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\nAdvice:\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Always show your work and reasoning.\n - Always check your solution in the original problem to ensure it makes sense.\n - Remember to substitute the value of the variable into the expression to find the final answer.\n"
