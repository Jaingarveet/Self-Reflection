        "content": "Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting \"A: Serous cystadenoma\" as the most likely ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy. However, upon further reflection, I realized that I made an assumption based on general knowledge rather than considering the specific features of each type of ovarian tumor.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nTheca lutein cysts are the most likely type of ovarian tumor to undergo torsion during pregnancy. This is because they are typically large, unilateral, and rapidly growing, which increases the risk of torsion. In contrast, serous and mucinous cystadenomas are less likely to undergo torsion because they are usually smaller and bilateral. Dermoid cysts are also less likely to undergo torsion because they are typically slow-growing and contain solid components that make them less mobile. Therefore, the correct answer is \"D: Theca lutein cyst.\""
