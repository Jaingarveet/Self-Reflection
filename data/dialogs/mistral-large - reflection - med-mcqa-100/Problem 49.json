In the case of blood, the pH is around 7.4, and the pKa of the bicarbonate buffer system is 6.1. However, the bicarbonate buffer system is effective in blood because of the presence of carbonic anhydrase enzyme in red blood cells, which rapidly converts carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, maintaining the pH balance. Additionally, the bicarbonate buffer system is an open system, meaning that the concentration of carbon dioxide can be adjusted through respiration, making it an effective buffer in the body.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") (Weak acid and weak base combination)\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"
