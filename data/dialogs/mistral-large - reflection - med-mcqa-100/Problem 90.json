Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider all the possible factors that could cause an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks. I assumed that since the patient had two previous normal deliveries, uterine anomalies were the most likely cause. However, placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie, and it is a more common cause than uterine anomalies.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect assumption\n* Incomplete analysis\n* Overlooking possible causes\n\nSolution:\nThe patient is a multigravida at 34 weeks with an unstable lie. The possible causes of an unstable lie in this case are uterine anomalies, oligohydramnios, placenta previa, or a pelvic tumor. However, the most likely cause is placenta previa, as it is a more common cause of an unstable lie than uterine anomalies, and the patient has had two previous normal deliveries, making oligohydramnios less likely.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the patient's gestational age and gravidity.\n2. Identify the patient's presenting symptom (unstable lie).\n3. Consider all possible causes of an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks.\n4. Analyze each possible cause and its likelihood based on the patient's history.\n5. Choose the most likely cause based on the analysis.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always consider all possible causes of a presenting symptom.\n* Analyze each possible cause based on the patient's history.\n* Do not make assumptions based on limited information.\n* Be thorough in your analysis to avoid overlooking possible causes.\n* Choose the most likely cause based on a comprehensive analysis."
