After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?\nChoices:\n  A: 3.5\n  B: 4.0\n  C: 4.5\n  D: 5.0\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nThe equation $h=-4.9t^2 + 25t$ describes the height of the ball over time. We want to find when the ball hits the ground, i.e., when $h=0$. \n\nSetting $h=0$, we get:\n$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n$t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$t = \\frac{-25 \\pm \\sqrt{25^2 - 4 \\cdot -4.9 \\cdot 0}}{2 \\cdot -4.9} = \\frac{-25 \\pm 25}{2 \\cdot -4.9} = -50/(-9.8) \\approx 5.10$ seconds\n\nNow, we consider the context: the ball is launched upward, so the relevant solution is the positive one, approximately $5.10$ seconds. This is closer to $[REDACTED]$ seconds, so the correct answer is **D**.\n"
