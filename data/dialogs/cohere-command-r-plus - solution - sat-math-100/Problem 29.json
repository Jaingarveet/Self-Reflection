In this case, we know that the weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons, and we want to find the planet where this same object would weigh approximately 170 newtons.\n\nLet's calculate the mass of the object using Earth's gravity:\n\\[m = \\frac{W}{g} = \\frac{150 \\text{ N}}{9.8 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{sec}^2}} \\approx 15.30 \\text{ kg}\\]\n\nNow that we have the mass, we can find the planet where this mass would result in a weight of approximately 170 newtons:\n- For Venus: $W = mg = 15.30 \\text{ kg} \\times 8.9 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{sec}^2} \\approx 136.20 \\text{ N}$\n- For Saturn: $W = mg = 15.30 \\text{ kg} \\times 11.1 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{sec}^2} \\approx 169.83 \\text{ N}$\n- For Uranus: $W = mg = 15.30 \\text{ kg} \\times 10.7 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{sec}^2} \\approx 163.71 \\text{ N}$\n- For Neptune: $W = mg = 15.30 \\text{ kg} \\times 14.1 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{sec}^2} \\approx 215.73 \\text{ N}$\n\nFrom the calculations, we can see that Saturn is the planet where the object's weight would be closest to 170 newtons.\n\nPrevious Answer: I previously selected \"C: Uranus\" as the answer, but upon reflection and further calculation, I realized that my mental calculation was incorrect, and Saturn is the correct choice.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
