If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet $x$ be the number of students in the class. We are given that $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + [REDACTED]$. \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives: \n$x = [REDACTED]$. This is incorrect, as it does not satisfy the second equation. \n\nCorrect Solution: \nStarting with the first equation, we can solve for $n$ to find: \n$n = 3x + 5$. \n\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives: \n$4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + [REDACTED]$. \n\nSimplifying and solving for $x$: \n$x = 10$, which satisfies both equations. \n\nNow we can find $n$: \n$n = 3x + 5 = 35$. \n\nWith $n$ milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl can give each of the $10$ students $4$ milliliters, with $5$ milliliters left over.\n"
