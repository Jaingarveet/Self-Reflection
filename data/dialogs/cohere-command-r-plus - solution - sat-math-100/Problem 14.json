This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. \n\nThe equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: \n\n$2x - 3y = 0 \\times 5a$. \n\nMultiplying by 5a gives: \n\n$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \\times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \\times a$, or $x + 2y = a$.\n"

So, the slope $m = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{-1}{3}$. \n\nSubstituting this value of $m$ into the equation $y = mx$, we get $y = \\left(\\frac{-1}{3}\\right)x$. \n\nTo make $x$ the subject, we can rearrange to get $2x - 3y = 0$. \n\nThis equation represents the relationship where the y-intercept is $0$, and the slope is $-\\frac{1}{3}$, which is consistent with the table. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $x + 2y = a$, as it simplifies to $2x - 3y = 0$ when simplified.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
