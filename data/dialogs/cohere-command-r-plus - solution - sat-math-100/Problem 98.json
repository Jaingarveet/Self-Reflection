Substituting this into the first equation gives:\n$3(2y - 19) + 4y = -23$, which simplifies to $6y - 57 = -23$, and then $6y = 34$, so $y = \\frac{17}{3}$. Substituting $y$ back into the equation for $x$, we get $x = 2(\\frac{17}{3}) - 19 = -5$. Thus, the solution is $(x, y) = (-5, \\frac{17}{3})$, which is not among the choices.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous solution was incorrect because I made a mistake in solving for one of the variables. I correctly solved for $y$ but made a calculation error when substituting back to find $x$. I should have found $x = -5$, but instead, I incorrectly calculated it as $3$. This led me to choose the wrong answer. To avoid such mistakes in the future, I need to be more careful with my calculations and double-check my substitutions.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
