Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $\\frac{x^2+5x+6}{x^2+5x+6}$, we get:\n$\\frac{(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6)}{(4x^2 + 20x + 25)(x^2+5x+6)}$.\n\nSimplifying the numerator, we get:\n$(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6) = x^5 + 8x^4 + 35x^3 + 70x^2 + 100x + 150$.\n\nTherefore, the equivalent expression is:\n$\\frac{x^5 + 8x^4 + 35x^3 + 70x^2 + 100x + 150}{x^2 + 5x + 6}$.\n\nThis matches the expression in choice [REDACTED], $\\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{2x + 5}$.\n"
