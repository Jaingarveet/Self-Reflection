Which of the following points lies on the line?\nChoices:\n  A: $(0,7)$\n  B: $(1,7)$\n  C: $(7,7)$\n  D: $(14,2)$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\nThe line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, and the slope is given as $\\frac{1}{7}$. We can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: \n$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$\n\nPlugging in $m = \\frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$, we get:\n$y = \\frac{1}{7}x$\n\nNow, we can test each choice by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation:\n- [REDACTED]: $(0, 7)$: $7 \\neq \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 0$\n- [REDACTED]: $(1, 7)$: $7 \\neq \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 1$\n- [REDACTED]: $(7, 7)$: $7 = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 7$, which is true, but this does not mean that $(7, 7)$ lies on the line. We cannot choose an answer based on a single point satisfying the equation. We need to test the equation with the coordinates provided in the choices.\n- [REDACTED]: $(14, 2)$: $2 = \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot 14$, which is true. This means that the point $(14, 2)$ satisfies the equation of the line and lies on the line.\n\nTherefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.\n"
