To find the temperature at which the speed of sound is closest to 1000 ft/s, I should have substituted values into the equation and solved for $t$. Instead, I incorrectly treated the values as absolute values and chose the answer that seemed closest to the calculated value. For a more accurate solution, I should ensure that I follow the equation precisely and check my calculations carefully.\n\nThought: \nTo find the air temperature that results in a sound wave speed closest to 1000 ft/s, we need to substitute the given values into the equation and solve for $t$. \n\nGiven equation: $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$\n\nWe want to find $t$ when $a$ is closest to 1000.\n\n$1000 = 1,052 + 1.08t$\n\nTo isolate $t$, subtract 1,052 from both sides:\n\n$1000 - 1,052 = 1,052 + 1.08t - 1,052$\n\n$-52 = 1.08t$\n\nNow, divide by 1.08 to solve for $t$:\n\n$t = \\frac{-52}{1.08} \\approx -48.15$\n\nThe temperature closest to $-48.15^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F}$ is $-48^{\\circ}\\mathrm{F}$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
