It is characterized by symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.\nType I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate hypersensitivity reactions mediated by IgE antibodies. They are responsible for allergic reactions such as hay fever, asthma, and anaphylaxis.\nType IV hypersensitivity reactions are delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by T cells. They are responsible for reactions such as contact dermatitis and tuberculin skin tests.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nExplanation:\nSpring catarrh is associated with both type I and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are responsible for the immediate symptoms of hay fever, while type IV hypersensitivity reactions are responsible for the delayed symptoms such as nasal congestion and postnasal drip. Therefore, the correct answer is \"D: ab\"."
