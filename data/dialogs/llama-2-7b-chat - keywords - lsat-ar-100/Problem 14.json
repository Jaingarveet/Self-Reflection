Since T is performed fifth, F must be performed either immediately before or immediately after T.\n\nUsing the information provided, we can determine the position of F as follows:\n\n* If T is performed fifth, then F must be performed either fourth or sixth.\n* Since F is not performed fourth, it must be performed sixth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C) third or fourth.\n\nError Keywords:\nREDACTED"
