However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect.\n\nThe information provided in the problem states that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, as the second batch of oatmeal cookies is already made on Monday. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.\n\nI also realized that choice B, The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, is also incorrect. This is because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.\n\nThe correct answer is choice E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This is because the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, and there is only one batch made on Friday, so the second batch must be made on Tuesday.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
