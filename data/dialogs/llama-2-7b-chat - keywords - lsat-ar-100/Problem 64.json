Here is my reflection on the problem:\n\n* I misinterpreted the condition \"Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\" I thought it meant that only one of Parra or Tiao could work in Zone 1, but it actually means that either of them can work in Zone 1.\n* I also misunderstood the condition \"Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\" I thought it meant that only one of Tiao or Udall could work in Zone 2, but it actually means that either of them can work in Zone 2.\n* I failed to consider the information that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, we need to use the information provided in the problem to determine which of the options could be true.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
