Let me re-evaluate the situation.\n\nJiang does not review Tamerlane, so Kramer and O'Neill are the only two students who review that play. Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review Sunset. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Megregian reviews Sunset.\n\nReflection:\nI made a mistake in my initial answer by assuming that Jiang reviews Tamerlane.
