Here is my self-reflection:\n\n* I misunderstood the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. I thought it only applied to the oatmeal cookies, but it actually applies to all three kinds of cookies.\n* I also misunderstood the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. I thought it only applied to the oatmeal cookies, but it actually applies to all three kinds of cookies.\n* I did not consider the fact that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I will use the following reasoning:\n\n* The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, so the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on a different day.\n* The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on a different day.\n* The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on a different day.\n* The only day left for the second batch of oatmeal cookies is Thursday, so the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday.\n* The only day left for the second batch of peanut butter cookies is Friday, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.\n* The only day left for the second batch of sugar cookies is Thursday, so the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made is:\n\n* oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday\n* peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday\n* sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
