        "content": "  Topic: Law\n\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\n\nReflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Here's my reflection:\n\nI misinterpreted the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews. I thought it meant that Lopez and Megregian did not review any of the same plays as Jiang, which led me to choose the wrong answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the information provided:\n\n* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.\n* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.\n* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nFrom these conditions, I can deduce that:\n\n* Lopez does not review Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill both review it.\n* Megregian reviews at least one play that Lopez does not review, as neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.\n* O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, as Kramer and O'Neill both review it.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\nThis is incorrect, as Lopez does not review Tamerlane, while Jiang does.\n\nB: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nThis is also incorrect, as Megregian reviews at least one play that Lopez does not review, while Jiang reviews Tamerlane.\n\nC: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\nThis is incorrect, as O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, while Megregian does not.\n\nD: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\nThis is incorrect, as Jiang reviews Tamerlane, while O'Neill does not.\n\nE: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nThis is incorrect, as Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B): Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does."
