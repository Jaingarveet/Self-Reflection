At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S.

To determine which composition P cannot be performed, I will analyze the conditions again.\n\nAction: Reflect on my previous answer and the problem conditions.\n\nThought: \nI see that my previous answer was incorrect. P cannot be performed second because the conditions state that P is performed at some time before S.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: sixth."
