I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\n\nThe correct answer is (B): Mon. morning: Irving; Mon. afternoon: Olivia; Tues. morning: Helen; Tues. afternoon: Kyle; Wed. morning: Nina; Wed. afternoon: Lenore.\n\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\n\n1. The condition states that George can give a report on Tuesday, but neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that George must give his report in the morning.\n2. The condition also states that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.\n3. The condition further states that exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. This means that there must be two students giving reports each day, and they must alternate between the morning and afternoon slots.\n\nUsing these constraints, we can deduce the following schedule:\n\nMonday:\n\n* Morning: Nina\n* Afternoon: Helen\n\nTuesday:\n\n* Morning: George\n* Afternoon: Irving\n\nWednesday:\n\n* Morning: Lenore\n* Afternoon: Kyle\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B)."
