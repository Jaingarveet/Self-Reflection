        "content": "Topic: Science\nQuestion: Sheep Challenge Evolution A species of sheep lives on the Scottish island of Hirta. Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?\nChoices:\n  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool\n  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool\n  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

However, I failed to consider the crucial information about the **increase in light-wool sheep population** despite the advantages of dark-wool sheep. This suggests an additional factor influencing survival and reproduction, which became clear with the introduction of a new predator.\n## Reasoning:\n*   The increase in light-wool sheep despite the strength and size advantage of dark-wool sheep implies **light wool provides a different survival advantage**, possibly camouflage or better heat regulation.\n*   Introducing a predator adds a new selection pressure. If light wool offers better camouflage, **light-wool sheep will have a higher survival rate** against the predator.\n## Conclusion:\nTherefore, the most likely immediate change will be: \nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
