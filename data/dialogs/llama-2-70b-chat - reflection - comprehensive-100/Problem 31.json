Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.\n  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.\n  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.\n  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.\n  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.\n\n  Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nThe medical researcher's argument is based on the assumption that stretching before jogging has no effect on the prevention of injuries. However, choice C states that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps where the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little or no effect. This implies that stretching before jogging may not be effective in preventing the types of injuries that are most common among joggers. Therefore, choice C weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that stretching may not be effective in preventing all types of injuries.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe medical researcher's argument is based on the assumption that stretching before jogging has no effect on the prevention of injuries. However, choice D states that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. This implies that the group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging may be more prone to injuries, which could explain why both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries. Therefore, choice D weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that the groups compared may not have been comparable in terms of their propensity for injuries.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Assumption\n* Comparability\n* Propensity\n\nSolution:\n1.
