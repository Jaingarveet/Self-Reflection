The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?\nChoices:\n  A: 40.8\n  B: 41.6\n  C: 42.2\n  D: 43.5\n  E: 44.8\n\n  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.\n2. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck.\n3. To find the weight of the new truck, we can use the formula for finding the new average:\n\nNew average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items)\n\nIn this case, the change in weight is 2.6 tons, and the number of items has increased by 1 (the new truck).\n\nNew average = 12.2 + (2.6 / 11)\n\nNew average = 12.2 + 0.236\n\nNew average = 12.436\n\nSince the new average is 12.436 tons, the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new average and the old average:\n\nWeight of new truck = New average - Old average\n\nWeight of new truck = 12.436 - 12.2\n\nWeight of new truck = 0.236 tons\n\nNow, we can check our choices:\n\nA: 40.8\nB: 41.6\nC: 42.2\nD: 43.5\nE: 44.8\n\nThe weight of the new truck is 0.236 tons, which is closest to choice B: 41.6.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
