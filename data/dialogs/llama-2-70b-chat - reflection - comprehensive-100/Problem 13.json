Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.\n2. If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.\n3. If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.\n4. Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.\n\nFrom constraint 1, we know that Lake G or Lake J must be visited.\nFrom constraint 2, we know that if the team doesn't visit E city or F city, they cannot visit Lake G.\nFrom constraint 3, we know that if the team doesn't visit E city, they cannot visit H mountain.\nFrom constraint 4, we know that the team must cross I peak to reach Lake J.\n\nNow, let's consider the given options:\n\nA: The group went to E city and J lake\nThis option is not possible, as the team cannot visit Lake J if they don't cross I peak.\n\nB: The group went to city E instead of city F\nThis option is possible, as the team can visit City E instead of City F, and still visit Lake G.\n\nC: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain\nThis option is not possible, as the team cannot visit Lake G if they don't visit E city or F city.\n\nD: The group went to F city and G lake tour\nThis option is possible, as the team can visit City F and Lake G, and still have the opportunity to visit H mountain.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Read the given information and constraints carefully.\n2. Identify the possible options based on the constraints.\n3. Evaluate each option and eliminate the impossible ones.\n4. Choose the remaining option as the answer.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Identify the key information and constraints in the problem.\n- Use a systematic approach to eliminate impossible options.\n- Double-check your answer to ensure it satisfies all the constraints.\n- Practice logical reasoning and critical thinking to improve your skills."
