If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\n\n  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The youngest member is 7 years old.\n2. The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 months, which means the next member's age would be 7 + 3 = 10.\n3.
