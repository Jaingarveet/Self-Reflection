However, I realize now that this is incorrect. Bicarbonates are weak bases, and their pH is not equal to their pKa. In fact, the pH of a weak base is typically lower than its pKa. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Bicarbonates are weak acids and weak bases, and their ideal concentration in blood is due to their ability to buffer the blood pH.\n\nAction: I will select option C as the correct answer."
