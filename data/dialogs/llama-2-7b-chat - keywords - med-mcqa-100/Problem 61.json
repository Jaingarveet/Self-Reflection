I mistakenly selected \"Clonic\" as the correct answer, which is not the most common type of seizure in newborns.\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the most common type of seizure in newborns is \"Myoclonic\" seizures, which are characterized by brief, sudden muscle jerks or twitches.\nI should have taken more time to carefully read the question and consider the options before answering.\nTo avoid similar mistakes in the future, I will make sure to read the question thoroughly and use my knowledge of pediatrics to provide an accurate answer."
