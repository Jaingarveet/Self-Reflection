However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is 50 cm.\n\nThe growth rate of children varies depending on their age and gender, but on average, children grow at a rate of around 2-3 inches per year. This means that in 4 years, a child would grow by approximately 8-12 inches, or 50 cm.\n\nI apologize for my previous mistake and hope this corrected answer is helpful.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
