I understand that the Bishop score is calculated based on the cervical dilatation, station of the fetal head, and the length of the cervix.\n\nUsing the information provided in the question, I can calculate the Bishop score as follows:\n\nCervical dilatation: 3 cm\nStation of the fetal head: -1\nLength of cervix: < 0.5 cm\n\nUsing the Bishop score formula, I can calculate the score as follows:\n\nBishop score = (3 x 1) + ((-1) x 2) + (< 0.5 x 3) = 7\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 8.\n\nError Keywords: REDACTED\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
