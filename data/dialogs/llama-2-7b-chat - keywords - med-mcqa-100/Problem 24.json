I mistakenly selected option A, Propylthiouracil, which is not recommended for use during pregnancy due to its potential teratogenic effects.\n\nTo answer the question correctly, I will consider the safety profile of each drug during pregnancy. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), methimazole is the safest antithyroid drug to use during pregnancy, as it has been shown to be effective in controlling hyperthyroidism without causing fetal harm. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Methimazole.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
