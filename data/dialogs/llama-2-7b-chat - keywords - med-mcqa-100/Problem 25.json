The patient is a 5-day-old term male neonate, which suggests that the condition is likely to be related to the newborn period. Additionally, the symptoms of delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting are consistent with intestinal obstruction or malrotation.\n\nBased on the Barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is (B) Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. This condition is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in neonates and is characterized by a thickening of the muscular layer of the pyloric ring, leading to hypertrophy and narrowing of the pylorus. This can cause vomiting, abdominal distension, and delays in meconium passage.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
