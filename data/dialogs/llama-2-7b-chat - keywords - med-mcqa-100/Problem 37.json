Here is my reflection:\n\nI mistakenly selected option D, Ergotamine, as a drug commonly used in PPH. However, upon further review, I realized that Ergotamine is not commonly used in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) management. Ergotamine is actually a medication used to treat migraines and other vascular headaches, and it has no role in PPH management.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, Oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in PPH management, as it helps to stimulate uterine contractions to control bleeding after childbirth. Mifepristone, Misoprostol, and Ergotamine are not commonly used in PPH management.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to accurately answer this question in the future."
