Cluster random sampling is the appropriate method because it allows for the selection of clusters of individuals, such as communities or neighborhoods, rather than selecting individuals randomly. This method is more appropriate for studying the spread of diseases and other health-related issues in a population.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Sampling method\n* Epidemiological study\n* Cluster random sampling\n* Simple random sampling"
