However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is (C) Anastomosis with Infraorbital artery.\n\nThe facial artery originates from the external carotid artery and runs along the face, supplying blood to the skin, muscles, and glands of the face. It terminates in an anastomosis with the infraorbital artery, which is a branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n\nI made a mistake in my previous answer by confusing the facial artery with the opposite side of the facial artery. I understand now that the facial artery does not terminate in the opposite side of the facial artery, but rather in an anastomosis with the infraorbital artery.\n\nTo avoid making the same mistake in the future, I will take the time to carefully review the anatomy of the facial artery and its termination point. I will also make sure to pay close attention to the key terms and concepts in the question, such as \"anastomosis\" and \"opposite side of the facial artery.\"\n\nAnswer: (C) Anastomosis with Infraorbital artery"
