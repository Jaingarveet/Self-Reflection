I also made an error in my calculation of the end product.\n\nAction: Review the question and my previous answer.\n\nEnd product of anaerobic glycolysis is C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH.\n\nExplanation:\nAnaerobic glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose in the absence of oxygen. In this process, glucose is converted into pyruvate, generating 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP + 2 NADH.\n\nReflection:\nI realized that I misunderstood the question and confused anaerobic and aerobic glycolysis. I also made an error in my calculation of the end product. I will make sure to carefully read and understand the question in the future.\n\nAnswer: C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH"
