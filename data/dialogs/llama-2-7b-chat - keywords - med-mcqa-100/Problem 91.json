The correct answer is (B) Whipple's procedure.\n\nWhipple's procedure is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic cancer that has spread to the stomach. It involves removing the tumor, as well as the affected part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct. The 'Liver shrinkage diet' is recommended before this procedure to reduce the size of the liver and make the surgery easier.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer, and I hope this reflection helps clarify the correct answer.\n\nError Keywords: [REDACTED]"
