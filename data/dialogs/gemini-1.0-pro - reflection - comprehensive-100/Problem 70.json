        "content": "Explanation:\nI made a mistake in setting up the equation that represents the equality of the populations in 2015. I incorrectly assumed that the population of City X in 2015 was 1.2 times the population of City Y in 2010, when it should have been 1.2 times the population of City X in 2010.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Incorrect equation setup\n- Population growth/decline calculation error\nSolution:\nLet $x$ be the population of City Y in 2010.\nIn 2010, the population of City X was 120,000.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by 20%, so in 2015 it was 1.2 * 120,000 = 144,000.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, the population of City Y decreased by 10%, so in 2015 it was 0.9 * $x$.\nSince the populations were equal in 2015, we have 144,000 = 0.9 * $x$.\nSolving for $x$, we get $x = 144,000 / 0.9 = 160,000$.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information.\n2. Define variables to represent the unknowns.\n3. Translate the problem into mathematical equations based on the given information.\n4. Pay close attention to population growth/decline rates and ensure calculations are performed correctly.\n5. Solve the equations to find the desired value.\n6. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure the solution is correct.\nGeneral Advice:\n- When dealing with word problems, take your time to understand the context and identify the relevant information.\n- Clearly define variables and use them consistently throughout your calculations.\n- Translate the problem into equations step-by-step, ensuring each equation accurately reflects the given information.\n- Be mindful of units and ensure they are consistent throughout the problem.\n- Double-check your calculations and reasoning to avoid careless mistakes.\n- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n- Consider using different approaches or representations to solve the problem.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if needed."
