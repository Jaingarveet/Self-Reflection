Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, the robots could potentially recognize both colors and shapes.\nError Keywords:\n- Oversimplification\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Ignoring possibilities\nSolution:\nRobot 1 picked up the red squares, which means it can recognize shapes.\nRobot 2 picked up the blue balls, which means it can recognize colors.\nHowever, we don't know if they can recognize both colors and shapes.\nTherefore, we cannot determine the specific types of robots 1 and 2.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the capabilities of each robot based on the experiment.\n2. Consider all possible combinations of capabilities for each robot.\n3. Eliminate options that are contradicted by the experiment.\n4. Choose the option that is consistent with all observations.\nAdvice:\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.\n- Consider all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions.\n- Be cautious about eliminating options without sufficient evidence.\n- Remember that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."
