Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n\nThought:\nGeorge, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.\nGeorge can only give a report on Tuesday.\nNina's report cannot be on Wednesday.\nOlivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.\nIf Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
