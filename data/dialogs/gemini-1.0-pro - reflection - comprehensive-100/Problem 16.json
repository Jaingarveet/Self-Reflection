Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Prince Lima in Li Na's mind is tall, handsome and doctor.She knew four men, Wang Wei, Wu Gang, Li Qiang, and Liu Dawei, and one of them met all the conditions she required.(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome; (2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors; (3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height; (4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei Not all are tall.\nQuestion: Who can meet all the requirements of Li Na?\nChoices:\n  A: Liu Dawei\n  B: Li Qiang\n  C: Wu Gang\n  D: Wang Wei\n\nThought:\n1. There are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.\n2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.\n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not all tall.\nBased on the information provided, we can deduce the following:\n* Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, but we don't know if they are tall or handsome.\n* Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height, but we don't know if they are tall, handsome, or doctors.\n* Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, so one of them must be tall and the other must not be tall.\nSince we know that there are 3 tall men, and Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, then either Liu Dawei or Li Qiang must be tall.\nNow, let's consider the information about the handsome man. We know that there is only 1 handsome man among the 4 men. Since Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors, they cannot be the handsome man. This leaves Liu Dawei and Li Qiang as possibilities for the handsome man.\nTherefore, the only man who can meet all of Li Na's requirements is the one who is tall, handsome, and a doctor. Based on the information we have, this man can only be **Liu Dawei**.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My initial analysis was correct in identifying the key information and potential candidates. However, I made a crucial error in assuming that only one person could be both tall and handsome. This led me to incorrectly eliminate Wu Gang as a possibility.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Oversimplification\n* Assumption error\n* Incomplete analysis\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Identify key information:**\n    * 3 tall men, 2 doctors, 1 handsome\n    * Wang Wei and Wu Gang are doctors\n    * Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height\n    * Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall\n2. **Analyze possibilities:**\n    * Wang Wei and Wu Gang cannot be handsome (both doctors)\n    * Either Liu Dawei or Li Qiang must be tall (not both Li Qiang and Wang Wei)\n    * One person can be both tall and handsome\n3. **Consider all options:**\n    * Liu Dawei: Could be tall, handsome, and a doctor (符合条件)\n    * Li Qiang: Could be tall and a doctor, but not handsome (排除)\n    * Wu Gang: Could be tall and handsome, but not a doctor (排除)\n    * Wang Wei: Could be handsome and a doctor, but not tall (排除)\n4. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only Liu Dawei fulfills all requirements.\n## Instructions for Future Problems\n1. **Read carefully and identify key information.**\n2. **Analyze all possibilities without making assumptions.**\n3. **Consider all combinations and eliminate options systematically.**\n4. **Double-check logic and reasoning before reaching a conclusion.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.**\n* **Use diagrams or tables to visualize relationships and possibilities.**\n* **Test each option against all criteria to ensure it meets all requirements.**\n* **Be mindful of potential biases and assumptions that might influence your analysis.**\n* **Don't rush to a conclusion; take your time to consider all possibilities thoroughly.** \n"
