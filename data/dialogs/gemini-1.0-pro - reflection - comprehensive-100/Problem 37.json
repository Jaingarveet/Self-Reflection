Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nThought: \nThe passage states that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person.\nThis implies that different cats may trigger allergies in different people.\nThe passage also states that no cat is incapable of provoking allergic reactions.\nTherefore, the most strongly supported statement is that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": "## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the variability of allergens among individuals while overlooking the passage's statement about the variability of proteins in cats themselves. \n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Overlooking information:** I failed to consider all relevant information in the passage.\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the passage's statement about individual allergens as implying a difference in allergens across all cats.\n* **Incomplete analysis:** My analysis was incomplete, focusing on only one aspect of the information provided.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify key information:** The passage states that:\n    * Allergic reactions are caused by proteins in cat skin secretions and saliva.\n    * The specific proteins responsible vary from person to person.\n    * All cats shed skin and spread saliva, so no cat is incapable of causing allergic reactions.\n    * Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n2. **Analyze the information:** \n    * The variability of allergens among individuals explains why different people react to different cats.\n    * The variability of proteins in cats explains why some cats are more likely to trigger allergies in certain individuals.\n3. **Choose the most strongly supported statement:** \n    * Statement C directly reflects the passage's information about protein variability in cats.\n    * Other statements may be partially true but are not as strongly supported by the passage.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. **Read carefully and identify key information.**\n2. **Analyze all relevant information, not just a subset.**\n3. **Consider all answer choices and choose the one most strongly supported by the information.**\n4. **Be aware of potential biases and misinterpretations.**\n5. **Double-check your reasoning and conclusions.**\n**General Advice:**\n* **Break down complex information into smaller, more manageable parts.**\n* **Use active reading strategies to identify key points and supporting evidence.**\n* **Consider alternative interpretations and potential biases.**\n* **Be willing to revise your understanding as you learn new information.**\n* **Practice applying these strategies to different types of problems.**\nBy following these steps and reflecting on my mistakes, I can improve my ability to analyze information and answer questions accurately in the future. \n"
