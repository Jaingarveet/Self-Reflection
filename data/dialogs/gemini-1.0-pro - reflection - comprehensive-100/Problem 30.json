Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\n\nThought:\nG is placed on the top shelf.\nI is placed on the middle shelf.\nK is placed on a higher shelf than F.\nO is placed on a higher shelf than L.\nF is placed on the same shelf as M.\nMore of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\nTherefore, the only possible arrangement is:\nTop shelf: G\nMiddle shelf: H, I, L\nBottom shelf: F, K, M, O\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

I incorrectly assumed that H and L had to be placed on the middle shelf together.\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of conditions\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Logical error\nSolution:\nG is placed on the top shelf.\nI is placed on the middle shelf.\nK is placed on a higher shelf than F.\nO is placed on a higher shelf than L.\nF is placed on the same shelf as M.\nMore of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\nTherefore, the possible arrangements are:\nArrangement 1:\nTop shelf: G\nMiddle shelf: I, K, L\nBottom shelf: F, H, M, O\nArrangement 2:\nTop shelf: G\nMiddle shelf: I, L\nBottom shelf: F, H, K, M, O\nOnly arrangement 2 satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand all the given conditions.\n2. Identify the books that have specific shelf placements (e.g., G on the top shelf, I on the middle shelf).\n3. Analyze the remaining conditions to determine the relative placement of other books (e.g., K above F, O above L).\n4. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.\n5. Eliminate arrangements that violate any of the conditions.\n6. Choose the arrangement that satisfies all conditions and has the required number of books on each shelf.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the wording of each condition and its implications.\n- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the conditions.\n- Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that do not meet all requirements.\n- Be systematic in your analysis and reasoning to avoid overlooking any possibilities.\n- Double-check your conclusions to ensure they are consistent with all the given information."
