Understand the context: the text describes a group of boys engaged in a sports drill.\n2. Identify the key elements: running, throwing, hitting a ball, and team formation.\n3. Recognize the social dynamics: the boys are working together as a team.\n4. Consider common rituals in team sports: drills often end with debriefs or strategy sessions.\n5. Interpret the choices:\n    - A describes a complex field game with multiple teams, which is unlikely to follow a simple drill.\n    - B mentions an unrelated game and has no connection to the described activity.\n    - C suggests the activity is over, but team sports drills often end with discussions, not just walking away.\n    - D aligns with the social dynamics and common rituals of team sports drills.\n6. Select the most sensible completion: choice D.\n\nAdvice:\n - Always consider the context and interpret the text within that framework.\n - Identify key elements and dynamics of the described situation.\n - Recognize common patterns and rituals associated with the context.\n - Interpret choices based on their alignment with the expected patterns and rituals.\n - Avoid choosing answers that introduce unrelated or overly complex elements.\n - Trust your common sense and select the most logical and sensible completion.\n"
