If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?\nChoices:\n  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms\n  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms\n  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms\n  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my answer. The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].\n\nThe weight of an astronaut on the Moon is indeed different from their mass on Earth, as the Moon has a much weaker gravitational pull than the Earth. The weight of an object on the Moon is approximately 1/6 of its mass on Earth, due to the Moon's lower gravity.\n\nSo, if the astronaut's mass on Earth is 84 kilograms, their weight on the Moon would be approximately 13.3 kilograms (186 pounds / 6 = 13.3 kilograms).\n\nKeywords: weight, mass, gravity, Moon, Earth.\n"
