I thought that as water changes state from steam to liquid, the molecules slow down and move closer together, which is not the correct explanation.\n\nThe correct statement that best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid is:\n\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\n\nAs water changes state from steam to liquid, the molecules actually move faster and occupy more space. This is because the molecules gain kinetic energy and move more quickly as they transition from a gas to a liquid.\n"
