Here's how you answered the question:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly, so you took the time to reflect on your solution and the correct answer. You realized that otters do not produce oil to coat their fur and make it waterproof, but rather newts drop their tails to distract predators and escape. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Newts drop their tails when threatened. Good job using self-reflection to improve your understanding and accuracy!"
