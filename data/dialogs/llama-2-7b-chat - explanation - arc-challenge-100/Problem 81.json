To avoid this risk, it is essential to use a specialized filter or projection method to view the Sun safely. Projecting the image of the Sun onto a piece of cardboard using a telescope or binoculars is a safe way to observe the Sun without damaging your eyes.\n\nIn contrast, option [REDACTED], \"Use only new equipment,\" is not a relevant precaution for observing the Sun. Option [REDACTED], \"Use a very strong telescope,\" may provide a clearer image of the Sun, but it does not address the safety issue of looking directly at the Sun. Option [REDACTED], \"Look at the Sun only in the morning,\" is also incorrect, as the Sun's position in the sky can change throughout the day, and it is not safe to look directly at the Sun at any time.\n"
