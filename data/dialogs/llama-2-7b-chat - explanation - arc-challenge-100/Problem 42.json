Here's your updated answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will continue to move in the same direction. This is because the force in one direction will cause the object to accelerate in that direction, while the force in the opposite direction will cause the object to decelerate. The net result is that the object will continue to move in the same direction, albeit at a changing velocity."
