Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely made an error in interpreting the given conditions and their implications for the possible zone assignments. This could have led me to incorrectly eliminate options or overlook a crucial constraint. \nTo avoid repeating the mistake, I will carefully analyze each condition and systematically deduce the possible zone assignments for each sales representative.  I will pay close attention to the constraint that \"Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone\" and use it to eliminate options that violate this condition. \n## Answering the Question:\n**Analysis of Conditions:**\n1. **Parra/Tiao:** One of them is in Zone 1, but not both.\n2. **Tiao/Udall:** One of them is in Zone 2, but not both.\n3. **Parra & Quinn:** Same zone.\n4. **Stuckey & Udall:** Same zone.\n5. **Zone 3:** More representatives than Zone 2.\n**Deductions:**\n* **From 1 & 2:** Tiao cannot be in both Zone 1 and 2, so she must be in Zone 3.\n* **From 3:** Quinn must also be in Zone 3 with Parra.\n* **From 2 & 4:** Udall and Stuckey must be in Zone 2. \n* **Zone 1:** This leaves Kim and Mahr for Zone 1.\n**Conclusion:**\nQuinn is in Zone 3 with Parra and Tiao. Therefore, Quinn **cannot** be in the same zone as **Stuckey** who is in Zone 2 with Udall.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
