This led to selecting an option that satisfied some but not all conditions. \n##  Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Number of Works:** We need at least 5 and at most 6 works. So, options with less than 5 or more than 6 works are immediately eliminated. \n2. **French Works Limit:** No more than 4 French works are allowed. This eliminates option D (3 French novels + 2 French plays = 5 French works).\n3. **Novels Requirement:** We need at least 3 but no more than 4 novels. This eliminates option A (1 French novel + 2 Russian novels = 3 novels) as it doesn't meet the minimum requirement.\n4. **French/Russian Novel Ratio:** We need at least as many French novels as Russian novels. This eliminates option E (3 French novels and 2 Russian novels) due to the French play restriction.\n5. **French Plays and Russian Play:** If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be. This eliminates option C (2 French plays are present).\nTherefore, the only remaining option that satisfies all conditions is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n(2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, 2 French plays, 1 Russian play) \n"
