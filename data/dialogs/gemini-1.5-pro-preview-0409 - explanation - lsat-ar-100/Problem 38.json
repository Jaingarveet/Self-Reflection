At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the placement of G on the top shelf and neglected the other conditions, leading to an inaccurate deduction about the middle shelf arrangement.  It's crucial to consider all given conditions and their implications systematically.\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Bottom Shelf Focus:** We know more books are on the bottom shelf than the top. Since G is on the top, there must be at least two books on the bottom. \n2. **Condition Implications:**\n    -  K being higher than F implies neither are on the bottom shelf.\n    -  O being higher than L implies L is not on the top shelf.\n    -  F and M are together, so they are either both on the middle or both on the top shelf.\n3. **Middle Shelf Deductions:**\n    -  I is confirmed to be on the middle shelf.\n    -  L cannot be on the top and has O above it, so L must be on the middle shelf.\n    -  Since F and M are together and cannot be on the bottom, they must be on the top shelf with G. \n4. **Therefore, the middle shelf must have I and L.**\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
