This led me to overlook a possibility that was actually prohibited by the given constraints. \n## Solving the Current Problem:\nTo avoid repeating the same mistake, I will analyze each option by considering all conditions simultaneously:\n**A: Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.**\n* This satisfies the conditions of at least one witness on Monday, Hong not on Monday, and Iturbe on Wednesday. \n* It also allows Garcia and Jackson to be on Tuesday, fulfilling the \"exactly two witnesses on Tuesday\" condition.\n* **This option is POSSIBLE.**\n**B: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.**\n* Iturbe must be on Wednesday, so this would place Franco on Wednesday as well.\n* This leaves only Monday and Tuesday for the remaining three witnesses.\n* Since exactly two must be on Tuesday, only one can be on Monday, violating the condition that Franco cannot be on the same day as Garcia.\n* **This option is NOT POSSIBLE.**\n**C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.**\n* This satisfies the \"exactly two witnesses on Tuesday\" condition.\n* It allows Franco to be on Monday (alone or with Jackson) and Iturbe on Wednesday.\n* **This option is POSSIBLE.**\n**D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.**\n* This satisfies the conditions of at least one witness on Monday and Hong not on Monday.\n* However, with Iturbe and Hong on Wednesday, and Garcia on Monday, this leaves only Tuesday for Franco and Jackson.\n* This violates the condition that Franco cannot be on the same day as Garcia.\n* **This option is NOT POSSIBLE.**\n**E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.**\n* This satisfies the conditions of at least one witness on Monday and exactly two witnesses on Tuesday.\n* It allows Franco and Garcia to be the two witnesses on Monday, and Iturbe to be on Wednesday.\n* **This option is POSSIBLE.**\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, options B and D violate the given conditions and are therefore NOT POSSIBLE.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
