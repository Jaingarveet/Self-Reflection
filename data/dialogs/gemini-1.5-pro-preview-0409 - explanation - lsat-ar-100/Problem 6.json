The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

This led me to a conclusion that wasn't fully supported by the given information.\n## Deductions from the Context:\n* **Two reviewers have identical reviews:** This is a crucial point that needs careful consideration.\n* **Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian:** This means Megregian reviews either 2 or 3 plays.\n* **Neither Lopez nor Megregian share reviews with Jiang:** This isolates Jiang's reviews from the others.\n* **Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane:** This links their reviews but doesn't specify their other choices.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Megregian's Reviews:** Since Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, and they can't share reviews with Jiang, Megregian must review **2 or 3 plays that are different from Jiang's reviews**.\n2. **Jiang's Reviews:**  Jiang's reviews are unique, meaning they reviewed either 1, 2, or 3 plays that no one else did.\n3. **Kramer and O'Neill:** They share Tamerlane, but one of them must have identical reviews to another student. This cannot be Jiang due to the restriction. \n## Conclusion:\nThe only option that MUST be true considering the above deductions is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
