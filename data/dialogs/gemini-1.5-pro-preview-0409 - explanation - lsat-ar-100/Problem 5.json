At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

This led me to a conclusion that wasn't necessarily true based on the given conditions.\n## Deductions from Given Conditions:\n* **Bottom Shelf:** Must have more books than the top shelf. \n* **Middle Shelf:** Contains book I.\n* **K & F:** K is on a higher shelf than F.\n* **O & L:** O is on a higher shelf than L.\n* **F & M:** F and M are on the same shelf.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n* **A:** We know O is higher than L, but we don't know its position relative to M and F. \n* **B:** We know K is higher than F, but we have no information about G's position.\n* **C:** We only know I is on the middle shelf; we don't know its position relative to F.\n* **D:** We have no information about G's position relative to O.\n* **E:** Since F and M are on the same shelf, and O is higher than L, and we need more books on the bottom shelf, the only possibility is F and M being on the top shelf and O and L being on the middle and bottom shelves. Therefore, F is on a higher shelf than L.\nAction: Answer(\"E\") \n"
