Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\nIn my previous attempt, I likely focused too much on the individual rules and not enough on the combined implications of those rules in relation to Robertson being assigned space #3. This led me to a conclusion that didn't necessarily follow from the given constraints.\n## Reasoning for Current Attempt:\n1. **Robertson in #3**: This means spaces #1, #2, and #4 are still available, along with #5 and #6.\n2. **Young > Togowa**: Since Robertson is in #3, Young must be in #4, #5, or #6. This leaves Togowa to be in #1 or #2.\n3. **Xu > Souza**: We don't have enough information to pinpoint their exact spaces, but we know Xu must be in a higher numbered space than Souza. \n4. **Constraints**: With Robertson in #3 and Young in #4, #5, or #6, the remaining spaces (#1, #2, and one from #4-#6) must be assigned to Souza, Togowa, and Xu.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the above reasoning, none of the options A, B, C, or E are *necessarily* true. However, option D, **Xu being assigned parking space #6**, must be true. This is because with Young occupying one of the spaces #4-#6, the only way for Xu to have a higher-numbered space than Souza is by taking #6. \n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
