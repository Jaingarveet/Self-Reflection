I should have systematically analyzed each option to see if it could fit within the given rules, rather than trying to construct a specific schedule. \n## Answering the Question:\n**Given:** \n* First peanut butter batch is on Tuesday.\n* Second oatmeal batch is also on Tuesday (same day as first peanut butter).\n* Second sugar batch is on Thursday.\n**Analysis of Options:**\n* **A: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday:** This is possible. Oatmeal and sugar cookies could have their first batch on Monday. \n* **B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday:** This is NOT possible. We already know the first peanut butter batch is on Tuesday, and no two first batches can be on the same day.\n* **C: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Wednesday:** This is possible. The first batch of either oatmeal or sugar cookies could be on Monday, allowing their second batch to be on Wednesday.\n* **D: Two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Thursday:** This is possible. We know the second sugar batch is on Thursday, and the first batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter could be on Tuesday, allowing their second batch to be on Thursday.\n* **E: Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday:** This is possible. Any two cookies could have their first batches on Monday and Tuesday, allowing their third batch to be on Friday.\nTherefore, the only option that is NOT possible is **B: Two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Tuesday.**\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
