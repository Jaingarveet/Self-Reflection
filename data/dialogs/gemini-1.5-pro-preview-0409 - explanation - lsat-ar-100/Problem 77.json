Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

It's crucial to analyze each rule and its implications carefully.\n## Step-by-Step Deduction:\n1. **Robertson's Constraint:**  Robertson must be in spaces #1-4 and above Young. This leaves only two options:  **(R1, Y2)** or **(R2, Y3)**.\n2. **Young & Togowa:** Young must be above Togowa, so Togowa can only be in **T1** in the first scenario and **T1 or T2** in the second scenario.\n3. **Xu & Souza:** Xu must be above Souza, leaving multiple possibilities for their placement depending on the first two deductions.\n4. **Remaining Space:** The last space (#6) will be filled by whoever among Xu, Souza, and Togowa hasn't been placed yet.\n## Conclusion:\nOnly **Robertson and Young** have their parking space limited to two possibilities. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
