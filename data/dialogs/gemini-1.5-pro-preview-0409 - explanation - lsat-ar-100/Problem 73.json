The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

This led me to overlook a possible scenario that satisfied all conditions.  To avoid this, I will now analyze each choice systematically, ensuring it aligns with all the given information and the fact that exactly three students review Undulation. \n## Analyzing Choices:\n**A: Megregian does not review Undulation.** \n* This could be true. If Kramer and Lopez review Undulation, and O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and Sunset, then Megregian could review Tamerlane and Sunset as well, satisfying the \"exactly two\" condition. \n**B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.**\n* This contradicts the given information. We know O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so if they don't review Undulation, they must review Sunset. This leaves only two spots for Undulation reviewers, contradicting the \"exactly three\" condition.\n**C: Jiang reviews Undulation.**\n* This could be true. If Kramer and Lopez also review Undulation, and O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and Sunset, then Megregian could review Tamerlane and Sunset as well, satisfying the \"exactly two\" condition.\n**D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.**\n* This could be true. If Kramer, Lopez, and Jiang review Tamerlane, and O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and Sunset, then Megregian could review Sunset and Undulation, satisfying the \"exactly three\" condition.\n**E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.**\n* This must be true. We know O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, and they cannot review Undulation (as per choice B analysis). Therefore, they must review Sunset.\n## Conclusion:\nChoices A, C, D, and E could all be true. However, only one option is presented as a choice.\n**Action: Answer(\"E\")** \n"
