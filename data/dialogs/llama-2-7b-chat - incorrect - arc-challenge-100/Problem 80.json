Which of the following is an example of heat being transferred by convection?\nChoices:\n  A: heating the pan\n  B: heating the soup\n  C: heating the spoon\n  D: heating the stove burner\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that heat is transferred from the hot pan to the soup through convection. The hot pan heats the soup through conduction, but the heat from the pan is transferred to the soup through convection as the hot soup molecules rise and cooler molecules sink. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) heating the soup.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
