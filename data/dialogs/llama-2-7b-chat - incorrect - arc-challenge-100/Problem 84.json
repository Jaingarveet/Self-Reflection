My solution was [REDACTED]. The correct answer is [C: decreasing algae blooms].\n\nExplanation:\nFertilizers contain organic materials that can run off into freshwater ecosystems during rainfall. These organic materials can lead to an increase in algae growth, which can cause a decrease in water clarity and oxygen levels. Therefore, the correct answer is [C: decreasing algae blooms]."
