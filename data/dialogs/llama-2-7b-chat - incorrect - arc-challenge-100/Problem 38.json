To determine which of the following has the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each volume of bricks and air.\n\nAction: Calculate the mass of each volume:\n\nA: 2 m^3 of bricks = 2 x 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg\nB: 4 m^3 of bricks = 4 x 2000 kg/m^3 = 8000 kg\nC: 6000 m^3 of air = 6000 x 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg\nD: 10,000 m^3 of air = 10,000 x 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg\n\nReflection: I realized that I made a mistake in my previous answer by not taking into account the density of the materials. I also noticed that the volume of air is much larger than the volume of bricks, which means that the mass of air is much lower than the mass of bricks.\n\nAnswer: The lowest mass is 6000 kg, which is the mass of 6000 m^3 of air."
