I selected option A, which is incorrect. The correct answer is option B, Newts drop their tails when threatened.\n\nNewts have a unique defense mechanism to avoid being eaten by predators. When they feel threatened, they drop their tails, which can continue to wriggle and distract the predator while the newt escapes. This is an excellent example of an escape strategy used by animals to avoid being killed and eaten by predators.\n\nI apologize for my previous mistake and hope this reflection helps me provide the correct answer this time."
