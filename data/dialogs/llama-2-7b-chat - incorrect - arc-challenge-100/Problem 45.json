If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. The correct answer is:\n\nB: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms\n\nExplanation:\nThe scale on the Moon reads 31 pounds, which is equivalent to 14 kilograms. Since the astronaut's mass on the Moon is 84 kilograms, the weight on the Moon is 31/2 = 16.5 kilograms.\n\nTo find the mass on Earth, we need to convert the weight on the Moon to mass. Since 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds, we can convert 16.5 kilograms to pounds as follows:\n\n16.5 kg x 2.2 lb/kg = 36.8 pounds\n\nTherefore, the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth are 36.8 pounds and 84 kilograms, respectively.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
