However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is \"C\", as the object will continue to move in the same direction due to the unequal forces acting in opposite directions.\n\nExplanation: When two unequal forces act on an object, the object will experience an acceleration in the direction of the larger force. In this case, the two forces are acting in opposite directions, so the object will continue to move in the same direction as before. The forces are not absorbed, and the object does not come to an immediate stop. Therefore, the correct answer is \"C\"."
