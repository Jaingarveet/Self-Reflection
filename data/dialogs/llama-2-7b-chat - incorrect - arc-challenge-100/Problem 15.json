Therefore, it is a mixture.\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly as \"C: The components retain their original properties.\" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the components of the snack do not retain their original properties when mixed together. They are still separate substances, but they are combined in a single mixture. Therefore, the correct answer is \"A: It is made up of more than one substance.\""
