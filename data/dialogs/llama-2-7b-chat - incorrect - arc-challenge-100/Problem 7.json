To determine how far the geese traveled on the first day, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the number of days it took them to travel that distance.\n\nAction: Let's calculate the distance traveled by the geese on the first day.\n\n2,000 km / 40 days = 50 km/day\n\nSo, the geese traveled 50 km on the first day.\n\nAnswer: C: 50 km"
