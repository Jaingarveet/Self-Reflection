I overlooked the importance of moisture in the chemical weathering process. Warm and moist regions are more likely to have a faster rate of chemical weathering due to the increased availability of water, which is essential for chemical reactions to occur. The presence of moisture allows for the dissolution of minerals and the formation of new compounds through chemical reactions, leading to a faster rate of weathering. Therefore, option B is the correct answer."
