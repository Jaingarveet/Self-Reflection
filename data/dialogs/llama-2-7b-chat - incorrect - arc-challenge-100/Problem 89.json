This is a positive step towards mitigating the effects of climate change.\n\nOption B, finding more sites for copper mines, could lead to increased mining activities, which can result in environmental degradation and pollution. This is not a suitable choice for a student interested in environmental issues.\n\nOption C, making ocean liners bigger and faster, could lead to increased fuel consumption and emissions, which would negatively impact the environment.\n\nOption D, replacing human workers with robots, is not directly related to environmental issues and could potentially lead to job displacement, which could have negative social impacts.\n\nTherefore, the best choice for a student interested in environmental issues is Option A, making cars run on less fuel. This option has the potential to positively impact the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and decreasing pollution."
