I will use my self-reflection to help me answer this question correctly.\n\nAs the water changes state from steam to liquid, the motion of the water molecules slows down. This is because the molecules are moving slower and are more closely packed together as they transition from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The molecules move slower and occupy more space.\n\n[REDACTED]"
