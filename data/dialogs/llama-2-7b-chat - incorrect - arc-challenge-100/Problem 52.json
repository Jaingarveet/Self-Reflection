However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is C: plants. Plants are the taxonomic group that store hereditary material in a single loop of DNA, known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a single loop of DNA, known as the chloroplast genome, which contains the genetic information necessary for photosynthesis and plant growth.\n\n[REDACTED]"
