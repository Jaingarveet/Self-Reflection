As the car reaches the flat surface, the force of gravity remains the same, but the car's speed decreases due to the loss of potential energy as it moves from a higher elevation to a lower elevation. The force of gravity acting on the car does not increase or decrease, so options A and B are ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The forces influencing the car are balanced."
