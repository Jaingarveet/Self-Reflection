Re-read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions governing the selection of the panelists.\n\nThe question states that a panel of five scientists will be formed, and the panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. The conditions for selecting the panelists are:\n\n* The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.\n* If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\n* F and K cannot both be selected.\n* K and M cannot both be selected.\n* If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\n2. Work through each possible scenario in your head or on paper, considering all the conditions and ensuring that your answer satisfies all of them.\n\nLet's consider all possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: M is selected as the only chemist.\nIn this scenario, we must select at least one botanist and one zoologist. F must be selected since K and M cannot both be selected. G and H can both be selected as botanists, and since M is selected, both P and R must be selected as zoologists. Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, and H are all selected, and P, Q, and R are all selected.\n\nScenario 2: K is selected as a chemist, and G is selected as a botanist.\nIn this scenario, we have already selected one chemist and one botanist, so we can select only one zoologist. However, this violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 3: K is selected as a chemist, and H is selected as a botanist.\nIn this scenario, we have already selected one chemist and one botanist, so we can select only one zoologist. This scenario is possible, but it violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nScenario 4: L is selected as a chemist.\nIn this scenario, we have already selected one chemist, so we must select at least one botanist and one zoologist. However, this scenario violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n3. Double-check your answer to ensure that it logically follows from the given conditions.\n\nLet's double-check our answer:\n\nIf M is selected as the only chemist, we must select at least one botanist and one zoologist. F must be selected since K and M cannot both be selected. G and H can both be selected as botanists, and since M is selected, both P and R must be selected as zoologists. Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, and H are all selected, and P, Q, and R are all selected.\n\nThis answer logically follows from the given conditions, and it satisfies all the requirements.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always take your time when answering questions and avoid rushing to conclusions.\n* Make sure you understand all the conditions and requirements of the problem before starting to work on it.\n* Consider all possible scenarios and test your answer against each one to ensure that it is correct.\n* Double-check your work to catch any errors or oversights.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
