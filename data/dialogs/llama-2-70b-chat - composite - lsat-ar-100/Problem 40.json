        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrectly placed the optometrist in space 5.\nThe correct placement of the optometrist is in space 4, as it must be next to the pharmacy.\nThe veterinarian should be placed in space 5.\nError Keywords:\n- Reasoning error\n- Placement error\n- Adjacency error\n\nSolution:\nGiven that the shoe store is in space 2, we can start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we can place one of them in space 3 and the other in space 6. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so we can place the optometrist in space 4 and the veterinarian in space 5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can place it in space 7.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the businesses that must be at the ends of the row.\n2. Place the pharmacy in space 1.\n3. Place one of the restaurants in space 3.\n4. Place the other restaurant in space 6.\n5. Place the optometrist in space 4.\n6. Place the veterinarian in space 5.\n7. Place the toy store in space 7.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.\n- Always consider all the constraints and rules given in the problem.\n- Always place the businesses in the correct order based on their constraints.\n- Never make assumptions or jump to conclusions.\n- Always double-check your placements to ensure they meet all the constraints.\n- Remember that the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, not the other way around.\n"
