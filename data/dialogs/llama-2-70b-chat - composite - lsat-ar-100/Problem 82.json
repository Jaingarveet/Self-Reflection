Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate matching of the sales representatives to the sales zones in which they work?\nChoices:\n  A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\n  B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\n  D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\n  E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI apologize for the mistake in my previous response.

However, I can provide you with some guidance on how to approach the question.\n\nThe question is asking for the correct matching of sales representatives to sales zones, based on the given conditions. To solve this problem, you can use a methodical approach by first listing out the conditions and then analyzing each choice to see if it satisfies all the conditions.\n\nHere are the conditions:\n\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nNow, analyze each choice and see if it satisfies all the conditions:\n\nA: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao\nThis choice does not satisfy condition 1, as both Parra and Tiao are listed as working in Zone 1.\n\nB: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\nThis choice does not satisfy condition 5, as there are only three sales representatives listed as working in Zone 3, which is fewer than the number of sales representatives listed as working in Zone 2.\n\nC: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao\nThis choice does not satisfy condition 2, as both Tiao and Udall are listed as working in Zone 2.\n\nD: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn\nThis choice does not satisfy condition 3, as Parra and Quinn are not listed as working in the same sales zone as each other.\n\nE: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall\nThis choice does not satisfy condition 4, as Stuckey and Udall are not listed as working in the same sales zone as each other.\n\nTherefore, none of the given choices satisfy all the conditions. The correct answer is [REDACTED].\n\nI hope this helps you understand the problem better and find the correct solution."
