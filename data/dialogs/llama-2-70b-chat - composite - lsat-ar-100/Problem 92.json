Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim\n  B: Mahr\n  C: Stuckey\n  D: Tiao\n  E: Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my reasoning and answer.\nI correctly identified that Quinn cannot work in Zone 1, but I incorrectly concluded that Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.\nI mistakenly assumed that [REDACTED] works in Zone 2, which is not stated in the conditions.\nError Keywords:\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Inference error\n- Assumption error\nSolution:\nEither Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1.\nEither [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2.\nParra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same sales zone as each other.\nThere are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.\nParra cannot work in Zone 1 if [REDACTED] works in Zone 1.\nTherefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.\n[REDACTED] or [REDACTED] works in Zone 2.\nQuinn cannot work in Zone 2.\nThe only option that satisfies this condition is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the conditions carefully and understand the relationships between the sales representatives and sales zones.\n2. Identify the constraints that apply to each sales representative and sales zone.\n3. Use a process of elimination to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with.\n4. Check your answer against the conditions to ensure it satisfies all the constraints.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n- Remember that assumptions not stated in the conditions can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n"
