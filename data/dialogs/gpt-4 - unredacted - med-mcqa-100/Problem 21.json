While it's true that Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale preferentially infect reticulocytes, or young red blood cells, it's Plasmodium malariae, the causative agent of quartan malaria, that is known to infect older, senescent red blood cells.\nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding\n- Incorrect association\n- Microbiology error\n- Malaria knowledge error\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is Quartan malaria. This is because Plasmodium malariae, the parasite that causes Quartan malaria, is known to infect older, senescent red blood cells. \nInstructions:\n1. Understand the question: Identify which type of malaria is associated with the infection of senescent RBCs.\n2. Recall the characteristics of different malaria parasites: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium malariae.\n3. Remember that Plasmodium malariae, which causes Quartan malaria, is known to infect older, senescent red blood cells.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your recalled information.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.\n- Make sure to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of different pathogens, including their preferred target cells.\n- Don't rush to answer; take your time to recall and verify your knowledge.\n- Regularly review and update your knowledge in your field to ensure accuracy.\n"
