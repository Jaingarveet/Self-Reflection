Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?\nChoices:\n  A: Rhinoscleroma\n  B: Wegener's granulomatosis\n  C: Stewa's granuloma\n  D: Rhinosporidiosis\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I made an assumption based on the patient's age and symptoms without considering all the possible diagnoses. I should have considered Rhinosporidiosis, which can also present with similar symptoms.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Diagnostic error\n- Differential diagnosis error\nSolution:\nGiven the patient's symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and blood-tinged discharge, the correct diagnosis should be Rhinosporidiosis. This condition is a chronic granulomatous infection that primarily affects the mucous membranes of the nose and nasopharynx. It is characterized by polypoidal lesions that can cause nasal obstruction and epistaxis, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the patient's symptoms carefully.\n2. Consider all possible diagnoses based on the symptoms.\n3. Do not make assumptions based on a few symptoms; consider the whole clinical picture.\n4. Remember that Rhinosporidiosis can present with nasal obstruction and blood-tinged discharge.\n5. Choose the diagnosis that best fits the patient's symptoms and age.\nAdvice:\n- Always consider all possible diagnoses before making a decision.\n- Do not make assumptions based on a few symptoms; consider the whole clinical picture.\n- Remember to consider less common diagnoses, especially when common conditions do not fit the clinical picture.\n- Always double-check your answer before finalizing it.\n"
