Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could he an accurate assignment of lab assistants to morning and afternoon sessions, respectively, on the three days?\nChoices:\n  A: Wednesday: Rebecca, Kevin Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Nessa, Olivia\n  B: Wednesday: Olivia, Nessa Thursday: Julio, Lan Friday: Kevin, Rebecca\n  C: Wednesday: Lan, Kevin Thursday: Rebecca, Julio Friday: Olivia, Nessa\n  D: Wednesday: Kevin, Rebecca Thursday: Julio, Nessa Friday: Olivia, Lan\n  E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin\n"

Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's. In choice C, Julio leads on Thursday and Olivia on Friday, satisfying this condition. However, in choice D, Julio leads on Thursday but Olivia leads on Friday, violating this condition.\nTherefore, the only choice that satisfies all the constraints is choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
