Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n2. If Franco and Hong testify on the same day, it can't be Monday because Hong doesn't testify on Monday. It also can't be Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, if Franco and Hong testify on the same day, it must be Tuesday.\n3. We're told that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. So if Franco and Hong are both on Tuesday, they must be the only two witnesses on that day.\n4. This leaves Monday and Wednesday for the other three witnesses. We know at least one witness testifies on Monday, so either one or two witnesses testify on Monday, and the remaining one or two testify on Wednesday.\n5. Since Franco and Garcia can't testify on the same day, and Franco is on Tuesday, Garcia must be on either Monday or Wednesday.\n6. The question asks what must be true if Franco and Hong testify on the same day. Looking at the choices, only D fits with our deductions. If Franco and Hong are on Tuesday, then Hong must be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
