The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We are told that M is the only chemist selected for the panel. This means that K and L are not selected.\n2. We are also told that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected. So P and R are definitely on the panel.\n3. Now, the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We have a chemist (M) and two zoologists (P and R). So we still need at least one botanist.\n4. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. But we already have two zoologists (P and R), so we can't have more than one botanist.\n5. Therefore, exactly one botanist must be selected. It could be F, G, or H, but we don't know which one specifically.\nLooking at the choices:\nA, B, and D all involve selecting more than one botanist, which we've determined is not possible. C involves selecting specific botanists and zoologists, which we can't determine. But E must be true - we know that P and R are selected, and since we need at least one of each type of scientist, Q must also be selected to have all three zoologists.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
