S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: J is second.\n  B: J is third\n  C: Q is first.\n  D: Q is third\n  E: R is seventh.\n"

S must be earlier than Y. So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n3. If S is in position 3, then Q cannot be third (as per the condition). So if S is third, Q must be first or second.\n4. If S is in position 1 or 2, then Q can be in position 3.\n5. J (finance) must be earlier than G (finance), and G must be earlier than R (nutrition). So the order of these three articles must be J, G, R.\n6. If Q is third, then S must be first or second (as per condition 2). In this case, J, G, R must occupy positions 5, 6, 7 in that order.\n7. If Q is first, then S can be second or third. But if S is third, then J, G, R must occupy positions 5, 6, 7, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.\nTherefore, if Y is fourth, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
