The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If four of the scientists selected are F, L, Q, and R, which one of the following must be the fifth scientist selected?\nChoices:\n  A: G\n  B: H\n  C: K\n  D: M\n  E: P\n"

F is a botanist, L is a chemist, and both Q and R are zoologists. So this condition is satisfied.\n2. Since F (a botanist) is selected, at most one zoologist can be selected. This condition is also satisfied as Q and R are the only zoologists selected.\n3. K is not selected, so the condition that F and K cannot both be selected is satisfied.\n4. M is not selected, so the conditions that K and M cannot both be selected and that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, are not applicable.\n5. Now, we need to determine the fifth scientist. We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R). \n6. The only condition that could affect the fifth selection is that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. But we already have two zoologists, so we cannot select another botanist.\n7. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a chemist, and the only remaining chemist is H.\nAction: Answer(\"H\")"
