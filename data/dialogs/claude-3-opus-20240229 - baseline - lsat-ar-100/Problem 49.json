Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n"

This eliminates choice D, as it has the restaurant and pharmacy in the middle.\n2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This eliminates choice E, as the pharmacy is not next to either.\n3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This eliminates choice A, as the restaurants are only separated by one business.\n4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. This eliminates choice C, as the toy store is next to the veterinarian.\n5. The only remaining choice is B, which satisfies all the constraints: \n   - The pharmacy is at one end and a restaurant at the other\n   - The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian\n   - The restaurants are separated by three businesses\n   - The toy store is not next to the veterinarian\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
