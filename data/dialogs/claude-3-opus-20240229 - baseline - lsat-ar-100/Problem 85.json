S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: In the order in which the articles are edited, S could be in any of the following positions EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: first\n  B: third\n  C: fourth\n  D: fifth\n  E: sixth\n"

S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n3. S must be earlier than Y.\n4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nLet's consider each choice:\nA. First: If S is first, Q must be third (condition 2). This allows for a valid order, e.g., S, Y, Q, J, G, H, R. So, S can be first.\nB. Third: If S is third, it violates condition 2 since Q is not third. So, S cannot be third.\nC. Fourth: If S is fourth, a valid order is possible, e.g., J, Y, H, S, G, Q, R. So, S can be fourth.\nD. Fifth: If S is fifth, a valid order is possible, e.g., J, Y, H, G, S, Q, R. So, S can be fifth.\nE. Sixth: If S is sixth, it violates condition 3 since S must be earlier than Y. So, S cannot be sixth.\nTherefore, the positions S cannot be in are third and sixth.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
