At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.\n2. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. This means that the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books, the middle shelf at least 2 books, and the top shelf exactly 2 books (since there are 8 books total).\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. This means that K must be on the top or middle shelf, and F and M must be together on the middle or bottom shelf.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means O cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n5. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A: We don't know the relative positions of O and M, so this is not necessarily true.\n   B: We don't know the position of G, so this is not necessarily true.\n   C: We know I is on the middle shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. So this must be true.\n   D: We don't know the position of G, so this is not necessarily true.\n   E: We don't know the relative positions of F and L, so this is not necessarily true.\nTherefore, the answer that must be true is C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
