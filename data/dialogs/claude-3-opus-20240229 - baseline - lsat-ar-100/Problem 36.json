Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.\n  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.\n  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.\n"

Yuki cannot test J, so on the first day she must test either F, G, or H. Whichever bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, Seamus must test on the second day.\n3. Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G or H on the first day, and the other of those two on the second day.\nNow, let's look at each choice:\nA. If Reynaldo tests G on the second day, he must have tested H on the first day. This is possible.\nB. If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must have tested either F or G on the first day. This is possible.\nC. If Yuki tests H on the second day, then she must have tested either F or G on the first day, and Seamus must test that same bicycle on the second day. This leaves no one to test J on the second day, so this is not possible.\nD. Seamus must test on the second day whichever bicycle Yuki tested on the first day. Since Yuki cannot test J, Seamus cannot test J on either day.\nE. If Theresa tests J on the first day and H on the second day, she cannot test G on either day.\nTherefore, either A or B could be true.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
