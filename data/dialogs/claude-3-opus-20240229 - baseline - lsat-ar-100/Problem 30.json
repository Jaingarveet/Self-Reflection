Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\nQuestion: If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Zara performs the first solo.\n  B: Wayne performs the third solo.\n  C: Zara performs the fifth solo.\n  D: The second solo is a traditional piece.\n  E: The fourth solo is a modem piece.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that the third solo is a traditional piece.\n2. We also know that exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and fourth solos are traditional.\n3. If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then the second solo cannot be traditional. This is because no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n4. Therefore, if the first and second solos are performed by the same pianist, they must both be modern pieces. This means that the third and fourth solos must be the two consecutive traditional pieces.\n5. We are told that in the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. Since we've determined that the fourth solo must be traditional, it must be performed by Wayne.\n6. Since the pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, and we know that the first and second solos are performed by the same pianist, the fifth solo must be performed by the other pianist.\n7. We can conclude that if the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, then Zara must perform the fifth solo.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
