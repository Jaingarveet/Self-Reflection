The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.\n  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n"

The question states that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen. This means Novetzke cannot be assigned an ambassadorship.\n3. We also know that if Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne. Since Kayne is assigned, Jaramillo may or may not be assigned.\n4. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. But since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.\n5. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.\n6. Looking at the choices:\n   A) Jaramillo may or may not be assigned to Venezuela. Not necessarily true.\n   B) Landon may or may not be assigned to Zambia. Not necessarily true.\n   C) Ong may be assigned to Zambia, but not necessarily. Not necessarily true.\n   D) Jaramillo may or may not be assigned. Not necessarily true.\n   E) Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela, but could be assigned to Zambia. This is the only choice that must be true.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
