Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\n"

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\n5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\nLet's consider each choice:\nA. If the optometrist is in space 5, the pharmacy could be in space 7 (next to the optometrist), with a restaurant in space 1. This satisfies all constraints. So this could be true.\nB. If the pharmacy is in space 1, the shoe store is in space 2, and a restaurant must be in space 7. This satisfies all constraints. So this could be true.\nC. If a restaurant is in space 3, it would be too close to either the pharmacy or the other restaurant at the ends. This violates the constraint of restaurants being separated by at least two businesses. So this cannot be true.\nD. The toy store being in space 6 doesn't violate any constraints directly. It depends on the placement of the other businesses. So this could potentially be true.\nE. If the veterinarian is in space 4, it would be next to the shoe store in space 2, leaving space for the optometrist or toy store in space 3. This satisfies all constraints. So this could be true.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A restaurant cannot be in space 3.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
