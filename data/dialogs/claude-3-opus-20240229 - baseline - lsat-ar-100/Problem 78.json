Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\n"

If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. \n3. Robert cannot give an afternoon report.\n4. If George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days:\n   - George gives his report on Tuesday\n   - Nina could give her report on Monday or Wednesday\n   - Robert could give his report on Monday or Wednesday morning\n5. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. But this is impossible because George must give his report on Tuesday.\n6. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday. This means Helen and Irving do not have to give reports.\n7. Robert can then give his report on Monday morning.\nSo, the correct answer is that Robert gives a report on Wednesday is a possible scenario.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
