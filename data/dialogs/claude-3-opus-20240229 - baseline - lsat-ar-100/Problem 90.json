        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?\nChoices:\n  A: a 1-day website target\n  B: a 2-day voicemail target\n  C: a 2-day website target\n  D: a 3-day voicemail target\n  E: a 3-day website target\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target. This means that for each client, the website target must be equal to or shorter than the voicemail target.\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So Image must have the 1-day voicemail target, and the other two clients must have either the 2-day or 3-day voicemail target.\n3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means Solide could have the 1-day or 2-day website target, while Truvest must have either the 2-day or 3-day website target.\n4. Given the above conditions, Image must have the 1-day website target (to match its 1-day voicemail target). Solide and Truvest cannot have the 1-day website target, as it would be shorter than Image's.\nTherefore, the 1-day website target cannot be set for more than one client (only Image can have it).\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
