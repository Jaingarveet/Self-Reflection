Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that bay 4 is holding produce.\n2. We also know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Since bay 4 is holding produce, textiles must be in either bay 3 or bay 5.\n3. However, we're also told that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. This means textiles cannot be in bay 5, as there would be no higher numbered bay for livestock. Therefore, textiles must be in bay 3, and livestock in a higher numbered bay.\n4. We're told that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Since livestock must be in either bay 5 or 6 (being higher than textiles in bay 3), grain must be in bay 6.\n5. Finally, we know that the bay holding produce (bay 4) has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, fuel must be in either bay 1 or bay 2.\n6. So, we have determined the cargo for bays 3 (textiles), 4 (produce), and 6 (grain). We also know that bay 1 or 2 is fuel, and bay 5 or 6 is livestock, but we can't determine exactly which for these.\nTherefore, the type of cargo is completely determined for three of the six bays.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
