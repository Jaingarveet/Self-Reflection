Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Souza is assigned parking space #4.\n  B: Togowa is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #5.\n  D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\n  E: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n"

So Young can only be assigned #1 or #2.\n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young is in #1 or #2, Togowa must be in the remaining one of those two.\n4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. The remaining spaces are #4, #5, and #6. Souza could be in #4 or #5, and Xu would be in a higher number.\n5. The only definite assignment we can make based on the given information is that Xu must be in parking space #6. This is because Xu must be higher than Souza, and #6 is the only remaining higher space than both #4 and #5 where Souza could be.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Xu is assigned parking space #6.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
