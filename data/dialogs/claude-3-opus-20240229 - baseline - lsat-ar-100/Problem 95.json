Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following lists could accurately identify the cargo held in each of the loading dock's first three bays, listed in order from bay 1 to bay 3?\nChoices:\n  A: fuel, machinery, textiles\n  B: grain, machinery, fuel\n  C: machinery, livestock, fuel\n  D: machinery, textiles, fuel\n  E: machinery, textiles, produce\n"

We also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So fuel must be in a lower numbered bay than produce.\n3. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So livestock must be in a higher numbered bay than textiles.\n4. And the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. So grain must be in a higher numbered bay than livestock.\n5. Looking at the answer choices, only choice E has textiles and produce in adjacent bays (bays 2 and 3 respectively).\n6. Choice E also has fuel in bay 1, which is consistent with fuel being in a lower numbered bay than produce.\nTherefore, the only choice that could accurately identify the cargo in the first three bays is choice E: machinery, textiles, produce.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
