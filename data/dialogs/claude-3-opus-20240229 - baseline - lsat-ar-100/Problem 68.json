S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If J is third, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is fourth\n  B: His sixth\n  C: Q is first\n  D: S is second\n  E: Y is fifth\n"

Since consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, the first two articles must be either Q, R, S (nutrition), or Y (wildlife).\n3. S cannot be second if J is third, because S must be earlier than Y, and Y cannot be first or second (as those spots are taken by nutrition or wildlife articles).\n4. Q cannot be first if J is third, because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.\n5. This leaves us with the possibility of R being first and Y being second, followed by J in the third position.\n6. In this scenario, H could be sixth, as it would follow G (which must be after J), and precede R (which must be after G).\nTherefore, if J is third, H could be sixth.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
