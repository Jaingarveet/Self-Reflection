Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?\nChoices:\n  A: one\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n"

Olivia must lead a session on Friday (since Julio's session must be earlier in the week than Olivia's).\n3. Lan cannot lead a session on Friday (since Lan and Olivia can't lead sessions on the same day).\n4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and it can't be Thursday (Julio has that slot) or Friday (Olivia has a session that day, and Nessa can't lead the other session that day because it's a morning session). So Nessa must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.\n5. We know the sessions for three lab assistants: Julio (Thursday afternoon), Nessa (Wednesday afternoon), and Olivia (one of the Friday sessions).\n6. We can't determine the exact sessions for the other three assistants (Kevin, Rebecca, and Lan) based on the information given.\nTherefore, we can determine the sessions for three of the other lab assistants.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
