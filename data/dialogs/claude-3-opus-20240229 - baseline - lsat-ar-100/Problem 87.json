This means at least 1 Russian work must be selected.\n3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected. This leaves room for 1-2 plays.\n4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. \n5. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. But we know at least 1 Russian work must be selected (from point 2).\n6. So if both French plays are selected, the Russian work must be a novel. This would mean selecting 2 French plays, 1 Russian novel, and at least 2 French novels to have at least as many French novels as Russian (point 4).\n7. But this totals 5 works, with 4 being French (2 plays, 2 novels). This hits the maximum number of French works (point 2).\n8. In this scenario, the organizer has selected 2 French novels, 1 Russian novel, and 2 French plays, meeting the \"at least\" requirement for answer choice A.\n9. No other answer choice is necessarily true in all valid scenarios.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
