Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\n"

George can only give a report on Tuesday. So if he's giving a morning report, it must be on Tuesday.\n3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. So if they're giving reports, they must be in the morning.\n4. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.\n5. Looking at the choices, only option E has George giving a report on Tuesday morning, which we know must be true.\n6. Option E also has Robert and Olivia giving morning reports, which aligns with the conditions.\n7. Therefore, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by Robert, George, and Helen, respectively.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
