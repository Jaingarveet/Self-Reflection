The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Manx are featured on day 3.\n  B: Siamese are featured on day 4.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 5.\n  D: Himalayans are featured on day 6.\n  E: Greyhounds are featured on day 7.\n"

Given that Himalayans are not featured on day 2, they must be featured on days 3, 5, and 7 to satisfy the condition that they are featured on exactly three days.\n3. Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on days 3, 5, and 7. They also cannot be featured on day 7 according to the given conditions.\n4. No breed can be featured on two consecutive days, so Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 since they are featured on day 1.\n5. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A. Manx cannot be featured on day 3 because Himalayans are featured on that day.\n   B. Siamese could be featured on day 4.\n   C. Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 because Himalayans are featured on that day.\n   D. Himalayans are indeed featured on day 6 in this scenario.\n   E. Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 as explained in step 4.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Siamese could be featured on day 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
