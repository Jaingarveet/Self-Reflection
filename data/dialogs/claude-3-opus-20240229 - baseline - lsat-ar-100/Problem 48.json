Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: Any of the following could be true EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the second day.\n  C: Seamus tests H on the first day.\n  D: Yuki tests H on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\n"

Theresa must be one of the testers for H, but it's not specified which day. So Seamus or Yuki could test H on the other day. This means choices C, D, and E could all be true.\n3. However, if Yuki tests H on the first day (choice D), then according to the last condition, Seamus must test H on the second day. This would mean Theresa cannot test H on either day, contradicting the condition that Theresa must be one of the testers for H.\nTherefore, choice D is the only one that cannot be true.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
