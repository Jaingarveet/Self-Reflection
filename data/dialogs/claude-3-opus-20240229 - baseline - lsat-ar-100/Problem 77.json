Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.\n2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.\n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.\n4. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.\n5. Looking at the employees individually:\n   - Robertson: must be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4\n   - Souza: no specific limitation\n   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2\n   - Vaughn: no specific limitation\n   - Xu: no specific limitation\n   - Young: must be assigned #1, #2, or #3\n6. Counting the employees with specific limitations:\n   - Togowa is limited to two possible spaces (#1 or #2)\n   - Young is limited to three possible spaces (#1, #2, or #3)\n   - Robertson is limited to four possible spaces (#1, #2, #3, or #4)\n   - The other three employees have no specific limitations\nTherefore, three employees (Togowa, Young, and Robertson) have their assignment limited to specific spaces.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
