Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Togowa is assigned parking space #1.\n  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.\n  C: Robertson is assigned parking space #3.\n  D: Souza is assigned parking space #3.\n  E: Vaughn is assigned parking space #4.\n"

Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n5. The question states that Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned #2 or higher (due to rule 3), and Robertson must be assigned #3 or #4 (due to rule 2). This is possible.\nB: If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned #3 or #4 (due to rule 2). This is possible.\nC: If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned #1 or #2 (due to rule 2). This is possible.\nD: If Souza is assigned parking space #3, then Xu must be assigned #4, #5, or #6 (due to rule 4), and Young must be assigned #4, #5, or #6 (due to the question statement). This is possible.\nE: Vaughn's assignment is not constrained by any of the rules or the question statement, so this is possible.\nAll of the answer choices could be true given the constraints. However, the question asks which one could be true, not which one must be true.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
