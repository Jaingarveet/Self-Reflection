Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n  E: Udall works in Zone 3.\n"

Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.\n3. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n4. The question states that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.\n5. If more representatives are in Zone 1 than Zone 3, and more are in Zone 3 than Zone 2, then Zone 1 must have the most representatives.\n6. For Zone 1 to have the most, it must have at least 3 representatives. The only way for this to happen is if Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1 (since they must be together), and Tiao is in Zone 2 (since either Tiao or Udall must be in Zone 2).\n7. This leaves Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3 (since they must be together), and Kim and Mahr to be distributed among the zones.\n8. The only answer choice that could be true in this scenario is B: Mahr works in Zone 2. Kim could be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
