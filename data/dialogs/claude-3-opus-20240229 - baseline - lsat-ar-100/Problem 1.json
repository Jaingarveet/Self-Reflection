This is also a fixed condition.\n3. At least one witness testifies on Monday. So Monday can have one or two witnesses.\n4. Hong does not testify on Monday. This eliminates some possibilities.\n5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This further constrains the possibilities.\nNow, let's look at each choice:\nA: This is possible. If Franco testifies on Monday, Garcia could testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.\nB: This is not possible. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, but Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who would have to be on Wednesday in this scenario.\nC: This is possible. If Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday, the other conditions can still be met.\nD: This is possible. If Garcia testifies on Monday and Hong on Wednesday, the other conditions are met.\nE: This is possible. If Jackson is one of the two witnesses on Tuesday, Monday could have two witnesses and the other conditions are met.\nTherefore, the only choice that CANNOT be true is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
