The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review only Sunset?\nChoices:\n  A: Lopez\n  B: O'Neill\n  C: Jiang, Lopez\n  D: Kramer, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian\n"

Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So if Jiang reviews Sunset, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Sunset.\n3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This means Megregian must review at least two plays.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. This means there must be a pair that reviews the same set of plays.\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\nA. Lopez - This could be possible, as we don't have any information that contradicts Lopez only reviewing Sunset.\nB. O'Neill - This is not possible, as we know O'Neill reviews Tamerlane.\nC. Jiang, Lopez - This is not possible, as we know Lopez cannot review any play Jiang reviews.\nD. Kramer, O'Neill - This is not possible, as we know they both review Tamerlane.\nE. Lopez, Megregian - This is not possible, as Megregian must review at least two plays.\nTherefore, the only possible answer is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
