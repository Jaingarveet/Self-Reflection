The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order in which the breeds of kitten are featured in the pet shop, from day 1 though day 7?\nChoices:\n  A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese\n  B: Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx Himalayan, Manx\n  C: Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese\n  D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Siamese, Himalayan\n  E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so a kitten breed must be featured on day 2.\n2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. So they must be featured on three of days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n3. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. This means Himalayans can't be featured on any two consecutive days.\n4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. This doesn't directly affect the kitten breeds.\n5. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. This means the kitten breed featured on day 1 (if any) can't be featured on day 7.\nLooking at the choices:\nA: This violates rule 3 as Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 4 and 5).\nB: This also violates rule 3 as Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 5 and 6).\nC: This satisfies all the rules. Himalayans are featured on three non-consecutive days (2, 4, 6), and no breed is repeated on consecutive days.\nD: This violates rule 3 as Siamese are featured on consecutive days (days 5 and 6).\nE: This violates rule 2 as Himalayans are featured on four days, not three.\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
