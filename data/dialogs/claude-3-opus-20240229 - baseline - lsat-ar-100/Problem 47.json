        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target\n  B: Solide's website target\n  C: Solide's voicemail target\n  D: Truvest's website target\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target\n"

We also know that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means Image's voicemail target must be either 2 days or 1 day.\n3. However, we're told that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.\n4. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. With Image's website target being 2 days, Solide's website target can only be 1 day, and Truvest's website target must be either 2 days or 3 days.\n5. Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Truvest's voicemail target must be either 2 days or 3 days to match or be shorter than its website target.\nTherefore, the only target that must also be 2 days is Truvest's voicemail target.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
