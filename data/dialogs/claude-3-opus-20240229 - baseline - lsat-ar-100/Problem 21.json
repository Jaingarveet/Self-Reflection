The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then the other two ambassadors assigned could be\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo and Landon\n  B: Jaramillo and Novetzke\n  C: Kayne and Landon\n  D: Kayne and Novetzke\n  E: Landon and Novetzke\n"

We also know that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n3. If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. But since Kayne can't be assigned to Yemen (due to Ong being in Venezuela), Kayne would have to be assigned to Zambia. This would mean Landon can't be assigned, as Landon can only be assigned to Zambia.\n4. So if Ong is in Venezuela and Jaramillo is assigned, the other ambassador must be Kayne, not Landon.\n5. On the other hand, if Jaramillo is not assigned, then Kayne doesn't have to be assigned. In this case, Novetzke could be assigned instead of Kayne.\n6. And if Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.\nTherefore, if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, the other two ambassadors could be Jaramillo and Kayne, or Landon and Novetzke.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
