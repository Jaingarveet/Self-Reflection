Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

This means if Parra is in Zone 1, Tiao cannot be, and vice versa.\n3. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. This means if Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall cannot be, and vice versa.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.\n5. There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nNow, let's consider each choice:\nA. Kim: There's no information about which zone Kim works in, so Quinn could potentially work with Kim.\nB. Mahr: Similar to Kim, there's no information about Mahr's zone, so Quinn could potentially work with Mahr.\nC. Stuckey: Stuckey works in the same zone as Udall. If Udall is in Zone 2, Tiao must be in Zone 1 (from point 3). In this case, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3. So Quinn could work with Stuckey.\nD. Tiao: If Tiao is in Zone 1, Parra cannot be (from point 2). Since Parra and Quinn work together, Quinn also cannot be in Zone 1 with Tiao.\nE. Udall: If Udall is in Zone 2, Tiao must be in Zone 1 (from point 3). In this case, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3. So Quinn could work with Udall.\nTherefore, the only person Quinn CANNOT work with is Tiao.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
