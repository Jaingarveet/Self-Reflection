Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses?\nChoices:\n  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.\n  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.\n  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.\n  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least three spaces between the restaurants.\n2. With seven spaces in total, this constraint effectively limits the possible locations of the restaurants to the ends of the row (spaces 1 and 7), or to spaces 2 and 6.\n3. Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:\n   A: This would restrict a restaurant to the middle three spaces, which is not equivalent to the original constraint.\n   \n   B: This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.\n   \n   C: This is equivalent to the original constraint. If either the toy store or the veterinarian is between the restaurants, then there must be at least two businesses separating the restaurants.\n   \n   D: This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.\n   \n   E: This is unrelated to the separation of the restaurants.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Substituting the original constraint with \"Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants\" would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
