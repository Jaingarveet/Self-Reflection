The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We are given that P is the only zoologist selected. This means Q and R are not selected.\n2. Since R is not selected, M (a chemist) cannot be selected. If M was selected, both P and R would have to be selected according to the conditions.\n3. Now, let's consider each answer choice:\n   A) If K is selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. K and G can be selected together as long as M is not selected.\n   B) If L is selected, F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. L and F can be selected together.\n   C) If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not necessarily true. The one chemist could be L.\n   D) If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is true. If two chemists are selected, they must be K and L (since M cannot be selected as discussed in point 2). And if K is selected, F cannot be selected according to the conditions.\n   E) If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. Even if two chemists (K and L) are selected, G can still be selected as the botanist.\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
