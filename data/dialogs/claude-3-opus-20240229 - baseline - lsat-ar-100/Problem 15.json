Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.\n  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.\n  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.\n  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.\n  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know the shoe store is in space 4. This means it's in the middle of the row.\n2. One restaurant must be at one end, and the pharmacy at the other end. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.\n3. If a restaurant is at one end, the pharmacy must be at space 1 (the other end). This is because if the pharmacy were at space 7, there wouldn't be enough space between the two restaurants.\n4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the toy store can't be next to the veterinarian, the veterinarian must be in space 2, next to the pharmacy.\n5. This means the optometrist, one of the restaurants, and the toy store must occupy spaces 3, 5, and 6 (not necessarily in that order).\n6. The shoe store in space 4 must be next to two of these: the optometrist, a restaurant, or the toy store.\nLooking at the choices:\nA: Not necessarily true. The optometrist could be in space 3 or 6, not necessarily next to a restaurant.\nB: This must be true. As deduced in step 4, the pharmacy in space 1 must be next to the veterinarian in space 2.\nC: Not necessarily true. A restaurant could be in space 3 or 6, not necessarily next to the toy store.\nD: Not necessarily true. The toy store could be in space 3 or 6, not necessarily next to the shoe store.\nE: Not necessarily true. The veterinarian must be in space 2, not next to the shoe store.\nTherefore, B is the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
