This satisfies the condition that T is performed immediately before F.\n2. Since T and F are performed fifth and sixth respectively, the condition \"At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F\" implies that R must be performed either first, second, third, or eighth.\n3. O must be performed either first or fifth according to the conditions. Since T is already occupying the fifth position, O must be performed first.\n4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. This leaves the second, third, fourth, and seventh positions for the remaining compositions P, R, and S.\n5. P must be performed before S. And there must be at least one composition either after O and before S, or after S and before O. \n6. If R is performed second, then P could be third and S could be fourth or seventh. This satisfies all conditions.\n7. If R is performed third, then P could be second and S could be fourth or seventh. This also satisfies all conditions.\n8. If R is performed eighth, then P could be second and S could be fourth, or P could be fourth and S could be seventh. Both these scenarios satisfy all conditions.\nTherefore, considering all the possibilities, S must be performed either second, fourth, or seventh.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
