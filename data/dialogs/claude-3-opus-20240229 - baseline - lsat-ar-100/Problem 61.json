The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  B: Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  C: Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\n  D: Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\n"

If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. This means if Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia (choice A), Kayne must be assigned to either Venezuela or Yemen.\n3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. However, Kayne could still be assigned to Zambia in this scenario.\n4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. So choice D (Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship) can be true.\n5. The question doesn't provide any information that would prevent Ong from being assigned an ambassadorship, so choice E can also be true.\n6. If Novetzke is assigned to Zambia (choice C), then Kayne cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship due to constraint 1. This scenario is possible given the constraints.\n7. However, if Kayne is assigned to Zambia (choice B), then Jaramillo must also be assigned due to constraint 2. But Jaramillo cannot also be assigned to Zambia, and the other two countries would need to be filled by the remaining candidates. This violates constraint 1, as neither Novetzke nor Kayne could be assigned in this scenario.\nTherefore, choice B (Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia) CANNOT be true given the constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
