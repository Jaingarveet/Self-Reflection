At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know that I is on the middle shelf.\n2. L is placed on a shelf higher than H. This means L must be on the top shelf, and H must be on the bottom shelf.\n3. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Since L is on the top shelf, O must also be on the top shelf.\n4. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. F is on the same shelf as M. So K must be on a higher shelf than both F and M.\n5. More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. We know L and O are on the top shelf. So the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\n6. H is on the bottom shelf. F and M are on the same shelf, which must be the bottom shelf to satisfy the condition of having more books than the top shelf.\n7. This leaves G and K. K must be on the middle shelf with I, as it's on a higher shelf than F and M.\n8. G is the only book left and must go on the bottom shelf.\nTherefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
