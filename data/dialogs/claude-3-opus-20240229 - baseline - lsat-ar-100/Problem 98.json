So K must be shown in either the afternoon or evening.\n3. L must be shown after K and before M. This means the order of these three houses must be K, then L, then M.\n4. Now, let's look at each choice:\n   A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because J is in the evening and K cannot be in the morning, so K must be before J.\n   B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because L must be before M, and M must be before J (since J is in the evening).\n   C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This could be true. If J is the 6th house, P could be the 7th.\n   D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible because there are only two slots after M (the evening slots), and one of those must be J.\n   E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is not possible because L and M must be between K and any houses shown in the evening.\nTherefore, the only choice that could be true is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
