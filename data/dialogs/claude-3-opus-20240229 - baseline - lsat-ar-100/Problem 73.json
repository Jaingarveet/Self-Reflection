The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.\n  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.\n  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.\n  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.\n"

Given (1), these two students must be Kramer and O'Neill, and they both review only Tamerlane.\n3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian must review at least two plays.\n4. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So the plays Jiang reviews cannot be reviewed by Lopez or Megregian.\n5. If exactly three students review Undulation, and we know from (2) that Kramer and O'Neill only review Tamerlane, then the three students reviewing Undulation must be Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.\n6. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A. This is false. As deduced in (5), Megregian must review Undulation.\n   B. This is true. As deduced in (2), O'Neill only reviews Tamerlane, not Undulation.\n   C. This is true. As deduced in (5), Jiang must review Undulation.\n   D. This could be true. Nothing prevents Lopez from also reviewing Tamerlane in addition to Undulation.\n   E. This is false. As deduced in (2), O'Neill only reviews Tamerlane, not Sunset.\nTherefore, of the given choices, both B and C could be true.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
