This leaves Franco, Garcia, and Hong to be scheduled on Monday and Tuesday.\n2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. This means that either Franco and Garcia testify on Tuesday (and Hong on Monday), or Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday (and Garcia on Monday), or Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday (and Franco on Monday).\n3. However, we know that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day. This eliminates the possibility of both of them testifying on Tuesday.\n4. We also know that Hong does not testify on Monday. This eliminates the possibility of Hong testifying on Monday and Franco and Garcia testifying on Tuesday.\n5. The only remaining possibility is that Garcia testifies on Monday, while Franco and Hong testify on Tuesday.\n6. Since Garcia must testify on Monday, and we know at least one witness testifies on Monday, it must be true that exactly one witness (Garcia) is scheduled to testify on Monday.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
