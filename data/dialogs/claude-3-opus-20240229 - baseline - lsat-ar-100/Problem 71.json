Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1. So if Parra is in Zone 1, Tiao must be in Zone 2 (because Tiao can't be in both Zone 1 and Zone 2). And if Tiao is in Zone 1, Parra must be in another zone.\n2. Similarly, Tiao and Udall cannot both be in Zone 2. So if Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall must be in another zone. And if Udall is in Zone 2, Tiao must be in Zone 1 (because Tiao can't be in Zone 3 with Udall).\n3. Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone. \n4. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone.\n5. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nNow let's look at the answer choices:\nA: Kim, Mahr - This could be possible for Zone 3, but we don't have enough information to confirm.\nB: Kim, Tiao - This is not possible. If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Udall must also be in Zone 3 (because they can't be together in Zone 2). But the list doesn't include Udall.\nC: Parra, Quinn - This could be possible for Zone 3, but we don't have enough information to confirm.\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This is not possible. Tiao and Udall cannot be in the same zone.\nE: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This is possible and fits all the conditions. Parra and Quinn are together, Stuckey and Udall are together, and there are more representatives in this zone than the maximum possible in Zone 2 (which is 2).\nTherefore, E is the only choice that could definitely be a complete and accurate list for Zone 3.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
