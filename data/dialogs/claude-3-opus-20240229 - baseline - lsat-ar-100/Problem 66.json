The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fourth.\n  B: H is sixth.\n  C: R is fourth.\n  D: R is seventh.\n  E: Y is fifth.\n"

This leaves positions 2, 5, 6, and 7 for Q, R, S, and Y. S must be before Y, but their exact positions are not fixed. So A does not fully determine the order.\nB: If H is sixth, then G and J must be 2nd and 4th (to alternate topics). J must be earlier than G, so J is 2nd and G is 4th. S must be earlier than Y, and the only spot left for S before 6th is 1st. This puts Y in 3rd, Q in 5th, and R in 7th. So B fully determines a unique order: S, J, Y, G, Q, H, R.\nC and D: If R is 4th or 7th, there are still multiple possibilities for the positions of the other nutrition articles Q and S, as well as Y. So C and D do not fully determine the order.\nE: If Y is 5th, S must be 1st or 3rd. But this leaves multiple options for arranging the other articles. So E does not fully determine the order.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
