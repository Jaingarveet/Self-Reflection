The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\n"

Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. If Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, then either Kramer or Lopez (or both) would also have to review it. But we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. So if Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, Jiang couldn't. \n3. Exactly two students review the same play(s). If Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, that would make three students (Kramer, O'Neill, Megregian) reviewing the same play, which violates the condition.\n4. Therefore, Megregian cannot review Tamerlane.\n5. We also know Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n6. So the only possible complete and accurate list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
