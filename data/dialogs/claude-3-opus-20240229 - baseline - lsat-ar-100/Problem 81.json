The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected.

This means 1 to 4 French works can be selected.\n3. At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected. This means either 3 or 4 novels are selected.\n4. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This means the number of French novels is greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.\n5. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.\nNow, let's look at each choice:\nA: No Russian novels are selected. This is possible. If 3 French novels and 2 French plays are selected, this satisfies all conditions.\nB: Exactly one French novel is selected. This is not possible. If only 1 French novel is selected, then at most 1 Russian novel can be selected (due to condition 4). This would mean at most 2 novels are selected, violating condition 3.\nC: All three plays are selected. This is not possible. If both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected (condition 5).\nD: All three Russian novels are selected. This is not possible. If all 3 Russian novels are selected, then at least 3 French novels must be selected (condition 4). This would mean at least 6 novels are selected, violating condition 3.\nE: All five French works are selected. This is not possible as it violates condition 2 (no more than 4 French works can be selected).\nTherefore, the only choice that could be true is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
