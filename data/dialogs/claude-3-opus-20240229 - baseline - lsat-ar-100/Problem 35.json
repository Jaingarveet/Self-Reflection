Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\n"

We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n3. If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means that all three batches of one kind of cookie are made before the third batch of the other kind.\n4. Looking at the choices:\n   A: This could be true. The question doesn't provide information to disprove this.\n   B: This could be true. The question doesn't provide information to disprove this.\n   C: This could be false. If the first batch of peanut butter cookies (and thus the second batch of oatmeal cookies) is made on Monday, along with the first batch of oatmeal cookies, then more than one batch would be made on Monday.\n   D: This could be true. The question doesn't provide information to disprove this.\n   E: This could be true. The question doesn't provide information to disprove this.\n5. Therefore, the only statement that could be false based on the given information is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
