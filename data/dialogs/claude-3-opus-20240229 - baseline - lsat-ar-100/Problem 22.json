If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nNow, let's consider each answer choice:\nA. F or else K: This cannot be correct because F and K cannot both be selected.\nB. F or else M: This could be possible. If G and H are selected, then either F or M could be the chemist.\nC. K or else M: This cannot be correct because K and M cannot both be selected.\nD. M or else Q: If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. But if G and H are also selected, this would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected. So this cannot be correct.\nE. P or else Q: If G and H are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. So either P or Q could be selected, but not both. This is a possible answer.\nConsidering the conditions, if both G and H are selected, the panel must include either F or M as the chemist, and either P or Q as the zoologist.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
