With three French novels already selected, at most one more French work (either a novel or a play) can be selected.\n3. The requirements also state that at least three but no more than four novels can be selected. With three French novels already selected, at most one more novel (Russian) can be selected.\n4.

It would bring the total to four novels (three French, one Russian), which is allowed.\nB. Two French plays: This is not possible. It would bring the total number of French works to five (three novels, two plays), which exceeds the maximum of four French works allowed.\nC. One Russian novel, one Russian play: This is possible. It would bring the total to four novels (three French, one Russian), which is allowed, and the Russian play can be selected since both French plays are not selected.\nD. One Russian novel, two French plays: This is not possible. It would bring the total number of French works to five (three novels, two plays), which exceeds the maximum of four French works allowed.\nE.
