Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be\nChoices:\n  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant\n  B: the pharmacy and the toy store\n  C: the two restaurants\n  D: a restaurant and the toy store\n  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian\n"

        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know the pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.\n2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist (because the toy store can't be next to the veterinarian).\n3. So we have this arrangement so far: \n   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant\n4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means the second restaurant can't be in the 4th or 5th position. It must be in the 6th position.\n5. This leaves the toy store and the veterinarian for the 4th and 5th positions. But the toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. So the veterinarian must be in the 4th position and the toy store in the 5th.\n6. The final arrangement is:\n   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Veterinarian - Toy Store - Restaurant - Restaurant\n7. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
