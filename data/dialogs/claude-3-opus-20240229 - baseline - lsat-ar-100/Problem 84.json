At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\n"

More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Since there are 7 books left, the only way to distribute them is 3 on the top shelf and 4 on the bottom shelf.\n3. K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M. This means F and M must be on the bottom shelf, and K must be on either the middle or top shelf.\n4. O is on a higher shelf than L. This means L must be on the bottom shelf, and O must be on either the middle or top shelf.\n5. So far, we know that F, M, and L are on the bottom shelf. We need one more book on the bottom shelf.\n6. Looking at the answer choices, only E has F, M, and L on the bottom shelf. The fourth book in E is G.\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: G, H, L, M could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
