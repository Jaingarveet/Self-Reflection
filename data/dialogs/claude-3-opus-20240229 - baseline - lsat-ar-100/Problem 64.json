Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\n"

We also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Since Stuckey and Udall are in the same zone, and Udall can't be in Zone 2 with Tiao, this means Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3.\n4. The question states that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same zone. So Mahr must also be in Zone 3.\n5. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone as each other. Since Parra can only be in Zone 1 or Zone 3 (because Tiao is in Zone 2), and there are more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3.\n6. This leaves Kim and Tiao. We know Tiao is in Zone 2. So Kim must be in Zone 1.\nTherefore, the only statement that could be true is:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
