Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.\n  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.\n  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.\n  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.\n  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

The correct answer is (C) A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income.\n\nThe reasoning in the argument above most closely resembles the argument in (C) because both arguments involve a trade-off between two competing interests. In (C), the interest is the individual's financial well-being, while in the argument above, the interest is the health of the marine species. Both arguments recognize that a decision that benefits one group may have negative consequences for the other group.\n\nIn (C), the argument is that limiting purchases and saving or investing the remaining income is beneficial for the individual, but if everyone did this, it would have negative consequences for the economy. Similarly, in the argument above, the decision to adopt a healthier diet that relies on fish as a protein source is beneficial for individual health, but it would have negative consequences for the marine species that are the source of that protein.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income."
