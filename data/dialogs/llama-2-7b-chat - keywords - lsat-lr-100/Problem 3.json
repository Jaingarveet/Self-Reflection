Upon reflection, I realized that the editorial's argument is that education is like the craft of painting, and the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. Therefore, the most logically completing answer is B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject.\n\nExplanation:\nThe editorial argues that education is like the craft of painting, and the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. This is similar to how education works, where the most important steps are laying a strong foundation and applying the primer coat of knowledge. Just as a painting cannot be completed without proper preparation and application of the primer coat, a student cannot make progress in a subject without a solid foundation and a clear understanding of the fundamentals. Therefore, the answer that most logically completes the editorial's argument is B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject.\n\n[REDACTED]"
