However, the argument's reasoning relies on the assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public. This assumption is flawed because government is not always trustworthy, and there are instances where government actions may not align with the public's interest. Therefore, the argument fails to consider that some of the assumptions used to justify the conclusion may be true, even if the conclusion itself is false."
