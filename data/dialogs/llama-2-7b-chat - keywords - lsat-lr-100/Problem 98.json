This assumption is not supported by evidence, as many technological innovations are driven by a desire to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain. The argument assumes that personal gain is the only possible motivation for technological advances, but this is not the case.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* (A) contains a premise that cannot possibly be true (the assumption that personal gain is the only motivation for technological advances)\n* (B) takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable (the argument assumes that commercial viability is the only possible outcome of technological advances)\n* (D) takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome (the argument assumes that motivation is the only factor that determines the outcome of actions)\n* (E) draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do (the argument makes a theoretical claim about the motivations of technological innovators without considering the complexity of real-world situations)"
