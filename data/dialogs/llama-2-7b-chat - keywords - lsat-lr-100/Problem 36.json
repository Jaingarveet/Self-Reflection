However, the argument does not rely on the assumption that native speakers are unable to hear the way speech in their language actually sounds. Instead, it relies on the assumption that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, which suggests that the way speech sounds in a language is not the same as the way it is perceived by native speakers.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* REDACTED (information not allowed to be seen)"
