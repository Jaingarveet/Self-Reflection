Here is my self-reflection:\n\nI mistakenly selected option A, which states that \"Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.\" However, this statement is not the correct explanation for the finding of the nicotine study.\n\nThe correct answer is option C, which states that \"Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\" This is because the study showed that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine.\n\nTherefore, I will answer the question with the correct option, which is option C."
