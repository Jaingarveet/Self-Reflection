I mistakenly assumed that the university would not maintain the quality of education if it increased its enrollment, when in fact, the argument is that increasing enrollment is necessary to maintain the quality of education. I also misunderstood the relationship between marketing and enrollment, thinking that marketing would not lead to increased enrollment.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Assumption\n* Inference\n* Conclusion\n* Argument\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
