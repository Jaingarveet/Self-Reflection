Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.\n  B: Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.\n  C: Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly.

The correct answer is (B) Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument in (B) is similar to the argument in the original question in that it makes a generalization about a group of people based on a single characteristic. In this case, the argument assumes that all politicians who disregard the wishes of most voters are foolish, and therefore, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians. This is a flawed reasoning similar to the one used in the original question, which assumes that a lack of engagement in political action by individuals with a sense of social justice means that they do not care about social justice.\n\nIn both cases, the argument relies on a false dichotomy, where two options are presented as the only possibilities, when in reality, there may be other factors at play. Additionally, the argument assumes that a single characteristic or action defines a group of people, when in reality, individuals are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to a single trait or action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians."
