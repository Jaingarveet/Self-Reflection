Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

Here is my reflection on the problem and the correct answer:\n\nError: I mistakenly chose option A, which is not the strongest counter to Tamara's objection.\n\nCorrect Answer: The strongest counter to Tamara's objection is option B, \"As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\" This is because it directly addresses Tamara's claim that many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to receive warning of a ninja's presence. By pointing out that ninjas were trained to walk silently, even on squeaky floors, Patricia can argue that the wealthy Japanese were unlikely to have been successful in detecting ninjas.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B."
