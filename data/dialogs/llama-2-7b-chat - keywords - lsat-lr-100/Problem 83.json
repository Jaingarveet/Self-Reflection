However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is Choice E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively. This is because Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune, not exclusively around the sun, which means it does not meet the criteria for a true planet.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively."
