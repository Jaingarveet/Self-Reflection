Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.\n  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.\n  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.\n  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer.

I mistakenly assumed that the argument was similar to a causal argument, when in fact, it was an example of a fallacy of confirmation.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. This argument is similar to the original argument in that it makes an inference based on a correlation, rather than a causal relationship. Both arguments rely on the idea that because one thing is true, another thing must also be true, without providing any evidence to support this claim.\n\nIn the original argument, the conclusion that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits is drawn based on the correlation between the location of Johns Hopkins University and the presence of auto mechanics with extensive experience. Similarly, in (C), the conclusion that most speeding tickets are issued to drivers of sports cars is drawn based on the correlation between the type of car driven and the likelihood of receiving a speeding ticket.\n\nIn both cases, the arguments are flawed because they do not provide any evidence to support the conclusion that one thing causes the other. They simply rely on the correlation between the two things to make their argument.\n\n[REDACTED]"
