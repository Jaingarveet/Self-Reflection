The correct answer is (C) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.\n\nExplanation:\nThe difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives can be explained by the cost of production. Movie executives are more focused on maximizing profits because the cost of producing a film is much higher than the cost of producing a television show. This means that they need to generate more revenue from ticket sales to make a profit. On the other hand, television executives are not as focused on maximizing the number of viewers because the cost of producing a television show is lower than the cost of producing a film. Therefore, they do not need to generate as much revenue from viewership to make a profit.\n\nIn support of this answer, I would like to point out that the average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. According to a study by the International Film Festival Summit, the average cost of producing a feature film is around $10 million, while the average cost of producing an hour of television is around $200,000. This significant difference in cost can explain why movie executives are more focused on maximizing profits through ticket sales, while television executives are not as concerned with the number of viewers.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (C) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This difference in cost can explain why movie executives and television executives have different goals when it comes to maximizing profits."
