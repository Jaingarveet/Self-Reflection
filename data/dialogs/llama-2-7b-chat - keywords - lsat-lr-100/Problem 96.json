        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that B: The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work.\n\nThe correct explanation is that the phenomenon described in the question can be explained by the fact that most of the motorists on heavily traveled highways are commuting to or from work. This means that they are more likely to be focused on their destination and less likely to be distracted, which can contribute to a lower rate of fatal accidents.\n\nIn contrast, option B is incorrect because the volume of traffic on a highway is not necessarily related to the rate of fatal accidents. While it is possible that highways with higher volumes of traffic may have more accidents overall, the relationship between traffic volume and fatal accidents is not straightforward.\n\nSimilarly, options A and D are also incorrect because they do not address the specific phenomenon described in the question. Option A is incorrect because distracted driving is not the primary factor contributing to the lower rate of fatal accidents on heavily traveled highways. Option D is incorrect because the speed of vehicles is not the primary factor determining the likelihood of a fatal accident.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is option C: Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work."
