If J is in, G must be in as well.\n*  Unless F, no M: M can only participate if F is participating.\nNow, if H is out, we still need to fill 3 spots with the remaining players (E, F, G, J, K, M). \n*  If we choose E, then F is out. This means M is also out (due to the last condition). We are left with needing to choose between J and K.  Choosing J forces G to be in. So, the team would be E, J, and G.  Choosing K would make the team E and K.  Neither option guarantees both players being included.\n*  If we choose F, then E is out. This allows M to be in. We still need to choose between J and K. Choosing J forces G to be in, making the team F, J, and G. Choosing K would make the team F, K, and M. Again, neither option guarantees both players being included.\nTherefore, with the given conditions and H being out, there is no scenario where two specific players MUST be included. \nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\") \n"
