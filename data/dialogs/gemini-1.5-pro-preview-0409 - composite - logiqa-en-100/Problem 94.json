This presents a strong alternative explanation. \n*   **Choice C:** This option discusses infrastructure spending, which may or may not be directly related to improved medical conditions. \n*   **Choice D:** This option highlights a specific area of high cost but doesn't necessarily negate the overall connection between cost and improved conditions.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
