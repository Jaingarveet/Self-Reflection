This means we have two possible scenarios to consider: one with E and one with F.\n*   **Condition 2:** J or K, but not both. This further splits our scenarios into four possibilities: E with J, E with K, F with J, and F with K.\n*   **Condition 3:** If J, then G. This eliminates the scenario with E and K, leaving us with three: E with J and G, F with J and G, and F with K.\n*   **Condition 4:** Unless F, then not M. This eliminates the scenario with E, J, and G, as it doesn't include F but would require M to complete the team of 4. \nTherefore, we are left with two possible teams: F, J, G, and one other (either H or K), or F, K, and two others (either E and H or G and H). Since the question asks for the *only* possible choice of two players, and F is the common element in both remaining scenarios, we need to find the player who must be in the team alongside F. Looking at the conditions, G is tied to J, and M is tied to F.  Therefore, the only player who must be on the team with F is H.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \n"
