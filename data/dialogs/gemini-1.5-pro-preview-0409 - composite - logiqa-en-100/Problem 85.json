This is false.\nC. **No paper J, but paper K:** We already established K is not used, making this option false.\nD. **Both G and J articles are unnecessary:** This aligns with our deductions. If G is not used, J is not needed. If G is used, J is still not needed due to point (2).\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical deductions: \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
