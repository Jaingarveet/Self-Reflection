We know Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than both Li Si and Miao Xiaoqin. \n*   **Option A**: If Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, then the order would be Wang Wu > Li Si > Miao Xiaoqin, making Zhang Shan's bonus higher than all. This supports the inference.\n*   **Option B**: If Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, then the order would be Zhang Shan > Li Si > Miao Xiaoqin, again supporting the inference.\n*   **Option C**: If Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's, we cannot definitively place Miao Xiaoqin in the order. She could have a bonus higher than Wang Wu but lower than Li Si, making the inference invalid.\n*   **Option D**: If Li Si and Wang Wu have the same bonus, similar to option C, we cannot definitively place Miao Xiaoqin and the inference might not hold.\nTherefore, options C and D do not guarantee the inference to be true. However, the question asks for the exception, meaning the option that does NOT make the inference hold.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
