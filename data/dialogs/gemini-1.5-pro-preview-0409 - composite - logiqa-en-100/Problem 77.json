Let's assume it's **G** (we can explore other options if needed).\n3. **Remaining Conditions:**\n    * **Condition (2):** F and K cannot be together. Since G is already in both groups, neither F nor K can be in the binding group.\n    * **Condition (3):**  This condition becomes irrelevant as K is not in any group.\n    * **Condition (4):** M must be in at least one group. Since it cannot be in the printing group, M must be in the binding group.\n4. **Binding Group:** G, M (minimum)\n**Evaluating Statements:**\n* **A: True.**  By construction, the groups share at least one member (G).\n* **B: Not necessarily true.** We only have one confirmed shared member. Adding another would violate conditions.\n* **C: Not necessarily true.** The current configuration has different group sizes.\n* **D: Not necessarily true.** The current configuration has the same size for both groups.\nTherefore, the statement that must be true is: \n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
