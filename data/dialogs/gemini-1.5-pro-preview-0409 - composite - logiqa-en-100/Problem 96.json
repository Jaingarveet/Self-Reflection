Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?\nChoices:\n  A: The cost and selling price of \"Inferno\" are lower than that of \"Harbour\".\n  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.\n  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.\n  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to \"Inferno\" magazine.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"
