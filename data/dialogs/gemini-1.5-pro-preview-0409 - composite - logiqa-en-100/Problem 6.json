They could have visited F city instead.\n* **C: G Lake and H Mountain:**  We know they visited G Lake, but there's no information guaranteeing a visit to H Mountain.\n* **D: F city and G lake:** This is possible and satisfies the constraints. \n**Conclusion:**\nWhile options B, C, and D are possible, only visiting F city and G lake is guaranteed based on the given constraints and the fact that they didn't visit I Peak.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
