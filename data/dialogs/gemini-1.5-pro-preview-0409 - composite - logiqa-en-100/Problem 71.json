It doesn't explain the discrepancy.\n* **B:** This option highlights a potential issue: **low salary offered**. If people are only willing to pay a low wage, it might deter qualified college students from taking the job, explaining the discrepancy. \n* **C:** This option focuses on the perceived benefits of student nannies, not the reasons for not hiring them. It doesn't explain the discrepancy.\n* **D:** This option explains why some people might not favor student nannies but doesn't address the gap between favoring and hiring.\nTherefore, the option that best explains the discrepancy is: \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
