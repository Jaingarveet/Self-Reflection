The correct structure should be \"All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]\".\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Implication direction error\n - Negation error\nSolution:\nThe given argument states: All landscape rooms (B) can see the landscape (A), Li Wenbing's family (C) can't see the landscape (not A), therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room (not B).\nOption [REDACTED] follows the correct structure: Anyone who meets the basic conditions (B) can apply for a small loan (A), Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan (not A), therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions (not B).\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the subject, predicate, and direction of implication in the original argument.\n2. Look for an option with the same subject-predicate relationship and implication direction.\n3. Pay close attention to negations and ensure they align correctly.\n4. Verify that the conclusion logically follows from the premises in the chosen option.\nAdvice:\n - Carefully analyze the logical structure of the given argument, including the direction of implication.\n - Pay attention to negations and their impact on the argument's validity.\n - Consider all options and eliminate those that do not match the logical structure or direction of implication.\n - Focus on understanding the reasoning process rather than just matching patterns. \n - Practice with various logical reasoning problems to improve your skills in identifying valid arguments.\n"
