However, I can still analyze the problem and try to reach the correct answer based on the given context and choices.\n## Analysis:\n1. **Three employers**: Tianshu, Tianji, Tianxuan\n2. **Five graduates**: Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao, Liu\n3. **Conditions**:\n    - Li works at Tianshu (from clue 1)\n    - Li and Zhao work at different places (clue 2)\n    - Liu and Zhao work at the same place (clue 3)\n    - If Zhang is at Tianxuan, then Wang is also at Tianxuan (clue 4)\n## Reasoning:\n- **Option A (Li and Liu at the same unit):** This is impossible because Li is at Tianshu and Zhao is with Liu, but Zhao cannot be with Li (clue 2).\n- **Option B (Wang, Zhao, Liu at Tianji):** This is possible. Li is at Tianshu, leaving space for the other three at Tianji.\n- **Option C (Only Liu at Tianxuan):** This is impossible because Zhao is with Liu (clue 3).\n- **Option D (Only Wang at Tianxuan):** This is possible only if Zhang is NOT at Tianxuan (based on clue 4). Then, Li is at Tianshu, Zhao and Liu could be at Tianji, leaving Wang at Tianxuan.\n## Conclusion:\nBoth options B and D are possible based on the given information and conditions. However, since I must choose only one, I will select the option that seems more likely considering the distribution of graduates among employers.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
