However, I can offer a solution to this problem.\n\nLet's say the sewing machine costs Rs. 1200. If Karan wants to make a 20% profit, he needs to sell the machine for a price that is 20% higher than the cost price.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the cost price of the machine:\nCost price = Rs. 1200\n\nNext, let's calculate the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit:\nSelling price = Cost price + (Cost price x 20%)\nSelling price = Rs. 1200 + (Rs. 1200 x 20%)\nSelling price = Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240\nSelling price = Rs. 1440\n\nNow, we need to find the price that Karan should mark on the machine so that after offering a 20% discount, he still makes a 20% profit.\n\nLet's assume the marked price is x.\nAfter a 20% discount, the selling price will be:\nSelling price = x - (x x 20%)\n\nWe want the selling price to be equal to the price we calculated earlier, which is Rs. 1440.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\nx - (x x 20%) = Rs. 1440\n\nSimplifying the equation:\nx - 0.2x = 1440\n0.8x = 1440\nx = 1800\n\nTherefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 so that after offering a 20% discount, he makes a 20% profit.\n\nAnswer: E: 1,800"
