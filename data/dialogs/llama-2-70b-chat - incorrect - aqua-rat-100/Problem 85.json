However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\nIf you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.\nIf you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the ground in 20 minutes.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that the time taken to reach the bottom is directly proportional to the number of steps walked.\n\nLet's assume the speed of the elevator is x steps/minute.\n\nWhen you walk 20 steps, you take 20/x minutes to reach the bottom.\nWhen you walk 10 steps, you take 10/x minutes to reach the ground.\n\nWe know that 20/x = 10 and 10/x = 20.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 20/10 = 2\n\nTherefore, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps/minute.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
