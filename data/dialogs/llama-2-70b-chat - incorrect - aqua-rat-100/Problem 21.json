However, I can give you a brief explanation of the formulas involved in solving this type of problem.\n\nThe formula for finding out how much work can be completed by x men working x hours per day in x days is given by:\n\nWork = (Men × Hours) / Days\n\nTherefore, if x men work x hours per day for x days, the work they can complete is:\n\nWork = (x × x) / x = x^2\n\nSimilarly, if y men work y hours per day for y days, the work they can complete is:\n\nWork = (y × y) / y = y^2\n\nNow, we can compare the two expressions:\n\nx^2 / y^2 = (y^2) / (x^2)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
