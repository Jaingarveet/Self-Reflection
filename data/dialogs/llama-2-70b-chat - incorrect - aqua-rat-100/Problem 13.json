However, I can give you some tips on how to approach this problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can start by recognizing that 7/8 and 7/18 are both fractions that represent the same proportion. Therefore, the value of 7/8 of a number is equal to the value of 7/18 of the same number.\n\nLet's call the number x. Then, we can write:\n\n7/8 x = 7/18 x\n\nNow, we can simplify the fraction by finding the common denominator:\n\n7/8 x = 7/18 x\n42x = 770\n\nNow, we can divide both sides by 42 to solve for x:\n\nx = 770/42\n\nx = 18\n\nTherefore, the number that the student was trying to find 7/8 of is 18.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
