A travels 5 km towards east.\n3. A travels 3 km towards north.\n4. A travels 2 km towards west.\n\nWe can represent A's journey as a vector diagram:\n\nS -> 3 km (south)\nE -> 5 km (east)\nN -> 3 km (north)\nW -> 2 km (west)\n\nWe need to find the resultant vector (or the final displacement) of A's journey.\n\nUsing the parallelogram rule, we can find the resultant vector:\n\nR = S + E + N + W\n= 3 km + 5 km + 3 km + 2 km\n= 13 km\n\nSince the question asks for the distance from A's starting point (home), we need to find the magnitude (length) of the resultant vector:\n\n|R| = √(13^2)\n= √(169)\n= 13 km\n\nTherefore, A is 13 km away from home.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
