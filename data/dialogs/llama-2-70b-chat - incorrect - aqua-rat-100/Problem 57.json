First, we need to convert the given information into the appropriate units. The distance from the center of the fan to the point on the edge of the blade is given as 10 centimeters. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute, so we need to convert this to revolutions per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we can divide 300 by 60 to get 5 revolutions per second.\n2. Next, we need to find the angular velocity of the fan blade. We know that the fan blade is rotating in a plane, so we can use the formula for angular velocity:\n\nangular velocity = distance from center of rotation to point on edge of blade / time\n\nIn this case, the distance from the center of rotation to the point on the edge of the blade is 10 centimeters. We need to convert the time from seconds to revolutions, so we can divide 30 seconds by 5 revolutions per second to get 6 revolutions.\n\nangular velocity = 10 cm / 6 rev = 1.67 cm/rev\n3. Now, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the blade after 30 seconds. We can use the formula for distance traveled in circular motion:\n\ndistance = angular velocity x time\n\nIn this case, the angular velocity is 1.67 cm/rev, and the time is 30 seconds, which we've already converted to 6 revolutions.\n\ndistance = 1.67 cm/rev x 6 rev = 10.02 cm\n4. Finally, we need to convert the distance from centimeters to pi centimeters. There are 100 centimeters in a meter, so we can divide the distance by 100 to get the distance in pi centimeters.\n\ndistance = 10.02 cm / 100 = 0.1002 pi cm\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
