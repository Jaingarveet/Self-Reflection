However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet's assume the field is a square with side length x.\nThe area of the field is x^2.\nThe cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take approximately x^2/10 days to graze the whole field.\n\nWe can simplify the calculation by recognizing that x^2/10 = (x/5)^2, since 5^2 = 25, and 25/10 = 2.5.\n\nTherefore, the time taken by the cow to graze the whole field will be approximately (x/5)^2 days.\n\nSince we don't know the value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of days.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\") 91 days."
