However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet's break this question down step by step:\n\n1. 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.\n2. 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.\n\nWe want to find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.\n\nLet X be the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. Therefore, the number of students who are members of the swim team is 24%.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. Therefore, the number of students who are members of the swim team but not members of the chess club is 20% of 24%, which is 4.8% (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\nSo, the total number of students who are members of the swim team is 24% - 4.8%, which is 20.4% (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n\nTherefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is 20.4%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
