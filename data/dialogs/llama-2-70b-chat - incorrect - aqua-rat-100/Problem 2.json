However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet X be the weight in tons of the heavy-duty truck.\nThe average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the heavy-duty truck was 12.2 tons.\nThe average weight of the 11 vehicles after adding the heavy-duty truck is:\n(12.2 + X) / 11\n\nThe question states that the average weight increased by 2.6 tons, so we can set up the equation:\n(12.2 + X) / 11 = 12.2 + 2.6\n\nSimplifying the equation:\nX = 42.2\n\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 42.2 tons.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
