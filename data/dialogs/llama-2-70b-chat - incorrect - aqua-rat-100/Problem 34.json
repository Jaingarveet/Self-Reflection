Therefore, I'll provide my answer based on my knowledge and understanding of the topic.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. The book was originally sold for Rs. 27.50 with a profit of 10%. This means the cost price of the book was Rs. 27.50 / (1 + 10%)) = Rs. 25\n2. If the book were sold for Rs. 25.75, the percentage profit/loss can be calculated as follows:\n\nPercentage profit/loss = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price\n= (25.75 - 25) / 25\n= 0.07 or 7%\n\nSince the selling price is lower than the cost price, this represents a loss. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nPercentage profit/loss = 2%\n\nI hope this answer is correct. If there's any further information or clarification needed, please let me know!"
