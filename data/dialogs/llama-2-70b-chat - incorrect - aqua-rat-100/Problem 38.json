However, I can offer a solution to the problem.\nThe surface area of the larger cube is 6*6*6 = 216 square centimeters.\nThe surface area of each smaller cube is 6*6 = 36 square centimeters.\nThe number of smaller cubes on the surface of the larger cube is 216/36 = 6.\nSince each smaller cube has 6 faces, the total number of faces on the surface of the larger cube is 6*6 = 36.\nTherefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 550 - 36 = 514.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
