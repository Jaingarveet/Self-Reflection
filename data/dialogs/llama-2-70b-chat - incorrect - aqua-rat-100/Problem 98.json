However, I can provide a solution to the problem:\n\nThe formula for calculating the amount owed after n years at a simple interest rate of p per annum is:\nA = P(1 + p)^n\n\nWhere:\nA = amount owed after n years\nP = principal amount (initial investment or borrowed amount)\np = simple interest rate per annum\nn = time in years\n\nIn this case, the principal amount (P) is Rs. 500, the simple interest rate (p) is 6% per annum, and the time (n) is 4 years.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\nA = 500(1 + 0.06)^4\nA = 500(1.06)^4\nA = 500(1.264)\nA = 632\n\nTherefore, the amount Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years is Rs. 632.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
