Let's consider the first book to be English.\n\nThere are 6 books in total, and we need to arrange them in a particular order.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange the books is equal to the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"ENGLISH\".\n\nThe word \"ENGLISH\" has 6 letters. The number of ways to arrange the letters in the word \"ENGLISH\" is 6!.\n\n6! = 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to arrange the books on the shelf is 720.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
