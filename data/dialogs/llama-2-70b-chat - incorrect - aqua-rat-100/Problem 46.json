However, I can provide a solution to the problem.\n\nLet X be the monthly income of the man.\nThe man spends Rs. 3500 per month, so his monthly expenses are Rs. 3500.\nHe saves 12 1/2% of his income, so his savings are 12 1/2% of X.\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\nX - 3500 = 12 1/2% of X\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nX - 3500 = 0.125X\n\nSolving for X:\n\n0.875X = 3500\n\nX = 4000\n\nTherefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
