However, I can try to solve it using the given information.\n\nLet's break down the information given in the question:\n\n1. A starts a business with Rs.40,000.\n2. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000.\n3. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000.\n4. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share.\n\nFrom the information given, we can calculate the total investment at the beginning of the business:\nTotal investment = A's investment + B's investment = Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 = Rs.100,000\n\nWe can also calculate the total profit at the end of the year:\nTotal profit = Rs.375,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the profit share of C:\nProfit share of C = C's investment / Total investment x Total profit\n= Rs.120,000 / (Rs.100,000 + Rs.120,000) x Rs.375,000\n= Rs.120,000 / Rs.220,000 x Rs.375,000\n= Rs.150,000\n\nNow, we need to find out how many months after B joined the business, did C join?\nWe can let X be the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nWe know that the total time period is 1 year, which is equal to 12 months.\n\nSo, we can write an equation:\nX + 2 = 12\n\nSolving for X, we get:\nX = 10\n\nTherefore, C joined the business 10 months after B joined.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
