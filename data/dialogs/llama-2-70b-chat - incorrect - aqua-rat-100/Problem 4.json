However, I can provide a solution to the problem:\n\nLet's assume the first train, Train A, leaves the station at time t. Then, Train B leaves the station at time t + 17 minutes.\n\nSince both trains leave simultaneously, we can set up the equation:\nt + 16 = t + 17\n\nSubtracting t from both sides gives us:\n16 = 17\n\nThis equation is not true, so we know that the trains will never leave the station simultaneously again.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
