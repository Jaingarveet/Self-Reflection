However, I can give a solution to the problem.\n\nLet's call the height of the tower h and the distance between the car and the tower's base d. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so the angle of depression (the angle between the line of sight from the car to the top of the tower and the line of sight from the car to the base of the tower) changes from 45° to 60° as well.\n\nWe can use trigonometry to find the length of time it takes for the angle of depression to change from 45° to 60°:\n\nsin(45°) = opposite side / h\nsin(60°) = opposite side / h\n\nWe know that the opposite side is the distance between the car and the tower's base (d), and the height of the tower (h) remains constant. So we can set up the equation:\n\nsin(45°) = d / h\nsin(60°) = d / h\n\nNow, we can solve for d:\n\nd = h \\* sin(45°)\nd = h \\* sin(60°)\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:\n\nh \\* sin(60°) - h \\* sin(45°) = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nh \\* (sin(60°) - sin(45°)) = 0\n\nh \\* (1/2 - 1/√2) = 0\n\nh \\* (1/2 - 1/√2) = 0\n\nh = 0 or h = 2√2\n\nSince the height of the tower cannot be zero, we know that h = 2√2.\n\nNow, we can find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n= d / s\n= (2√2) / s\n\nWe know that the distance between the car and the tower's base is 2√2, and the speed of the car is constant. So we can solve for the time:\n\nTime = (2√2) / s\n\nWe are not given the speed of the car, so we cannot find the exact time. However, we can eliminate answer choices that are not in the correct proportion to the height of the tower:\n\n2√2 / s = 5(√3 + 1)\n2√2 / s = 6(√3 + √2)\n2√2 / s = 7(√3 – 1)\n2√2 / s = 8(√3 – 2)\n\nWe can see that only answer choice B has the correct proportion to the height of the tower:\n\n2√2 / s ≈ 6(√3 + √2)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 6(√3 + √2).\n\nNote: In this solution, we assumed that the car's speed is constant. If the car's speed changes, then we would need additional information to solve the problem."
