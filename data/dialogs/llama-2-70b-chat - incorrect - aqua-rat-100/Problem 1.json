However, I can offer a solution to the problem.\n\nLet's consider the diameter of the sphere as 2r, where r is the radius of the sphere.\nSince all eight vertices of the rectangular solid are on the sphere, we can say that the distance between any two opposite vertices is equal to the diameter of the sphere.\n\nLet's call the length of one side of the rectangular solid \"a\" and the length of the other side \"b\". Since it's a 3 x 4 x 15 rectangular solid, we have:\na = 3, b = 4, and c = 15\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid:\nd = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25)\n\nNow, we can set up a proportion to relate the diameter of the sphere to the length of the diagonal:\ndiameter = 2r\nd = 2r\n\nWe can solve for r:\nr = d/2\nr = sqrt(25)/2\nr = 5\n\nNow we can find the diameter:\ndiameter = 2r\ndiameter = 2(5)\ndiameter = 10\n\nSo, the diameter of the sphere is 10.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
