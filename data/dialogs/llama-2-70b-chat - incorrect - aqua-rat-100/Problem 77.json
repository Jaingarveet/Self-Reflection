However, I can offer a solution to the problem.\nThe sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be represented as:\nn + (n + 2) + (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\nwhere n is the first number.\nWe know that when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square.\nLet's find the square root of the sum:\n\nSquare root (n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8))\n= Square root (5n + 20)\n= 5 square root (n + 4)\n\nSince the square root of 5 is irrational, the only way for 5 square root (n + 4) to be a perfect square is when n + 4 is a perfect square.\n\nLet's find when n + 4 is a perfect square:\nn + 4 = m^2\nn = m^2 - 4\n\nSince n is a two-digit odd number, m must be even.\nm^2 - 4 must be odd.\nThe only even perfect square - 4 is 16, which means m = 4.\n\nSo, n = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12.\nThe first number is 12, and the next 4 consecutive two-digit odd numbers are 13, 15, 17, 19.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
