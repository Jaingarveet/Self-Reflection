However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet's call the radius of the semi-circles r. Since the paper is a square with side length 20 cm, the radius of the semi-circles is half of the side length, that is, r = 20/2 = 10 cm.\n\nThe area of the semi-circles is given by:\nArea = (1/2)πr^2\n= (1/2)π(10)^2\n= 50π\n\nNow, the area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semi-circles:\nArea = 20^2 - 50π\n= 400 - 50π\n= 350π\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
