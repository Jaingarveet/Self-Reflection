However, I can still answer the question using the given choices.\n\nLet's call the length and breadth of the wire x and y, respectively. Since the wire is bent to form a square, the length and breadth of the square will also be x and y.\n\nThe area of the square is given by xy. Since the wire was originally a rectangle, the area of the rectangle is also xy.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\nxy = 27 * 17\nxy = 469\n\nNow, we can check the given choices:\n\nA: 9\n9^2 = 81, which is not equal to 469.\n\nB: 11\n11^2 = 121, which is not equal to 469.\n\nC: 22\n22^2 = 484, which is greater than 469.\n\nD: 25\n25^2 = 625, which is greater than 469.\n\nE: 31\n31^2 = 961, which is greater than 469.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 11.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
