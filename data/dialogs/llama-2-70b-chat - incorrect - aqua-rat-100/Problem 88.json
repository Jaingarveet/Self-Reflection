However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet's first calculate the time taken to cover the quarter distance.\nQuarter distance = Total distance / 4\nTotal distance = 100 miles/hour x 10 hours = 1000 miles\nQuarter distance = 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles\n\nTime taken to cover quarter distance = Distance / Speed\n= 250 miles / 75 miles/hour\n= 3.33 hours\n\nNow, let's calculate the time taken for the remaining distance.\nRemaining distance = Total distance - Quarter distance\n= 1000 miles - 250 miles\n= 750 miles\n\nTime taken to cover remaining distance = Distance / Speed\n= 750 miles / 75 miles/hour\n= 10 hours\n\nTotal journey duration = Time taken to cover quarter distance + Time taken to cover remaining distance\n= 3.33 hours + 10 hours\n= 13.33 hours\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 13.5 hours."
