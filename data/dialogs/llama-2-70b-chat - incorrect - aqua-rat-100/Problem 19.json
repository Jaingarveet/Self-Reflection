However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nLet's call the distance traveled by the jeep x km.\n\nWe know that the jeep travels at a constant speed during the forward journey, so its speed can be represented as v km/hr.\n\nThe time taken for the forward journey is 6 hours, so we can write:\n\nx/v = 6 ... (1)\n\nNow, during the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so its new speed is v + 12 km/hr.\n\nThe time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so we can write:\n\nx/(v + 12) = 4 ... (2)\n\nWe can solve for x in equation (2):\n\nx = (v + 12)4\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of v from equation (1):\n\nx = (6/v + 12)4\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 12(6/v + 12)\n\nx = 72\n\nSo, the distance traveled by the jeep is 72 km.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
