        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be\nChoices:\n  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant\n  B: the pharmacy and the toy store\n  C: the two restaurants\n  D: a restaurant and the toy store\n  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.\n2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.\n3. So we have this arrangement so far: \n   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant\n4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means the second restaurant could be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.\n5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. \n6. Given these constraints, there are two possible arrangements:\n   a) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Restaurant\n   b) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Restaurant - Veterinarian - Restaurant\n7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are [REDACTED].\n"
