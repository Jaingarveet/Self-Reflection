        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.\n2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.\n3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.\n4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.\n5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.\n6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.\n7. Looking at the employees individually:\n   - Robertson: must be assigned #3 or #4 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)\n   - Souza: no specific limitation \n   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)\n   - Vaughn: no specific limitation\n   - Xu: no specific limitation\n   - Young: must be assigned #2 or #3 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)\n8. Counting the employees with assignments limited to only [REDACTED] spaces:\n   - Togowa, Young, Robertson are each limited to [REDACTED] specific spaces\n   - Souza, Vaughn, Xu have no such limitation\nTherefore, [REDACTED] employees (Togowa, Young, Robertson, and Vaughn) have their assignment limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.\n"
