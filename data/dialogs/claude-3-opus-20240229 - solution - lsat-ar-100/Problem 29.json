At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven:\n - I is on the middle shelf\n - L is on a higher shelf than H\n - O is on a higher shelf than L\n - K is on a higher shelf than F\n - F is on the same shelf as M\n - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf\nStep 1: Place L and O on the top shelf (since O is higher than L, and L is higher than H).\nStep 2: Place I on the middle shelf.\nStep 3: Place H on the bottom shelf (since L is higher than H).\nStep 4: Place F and M on the same shelf, which must be the middle shelf (since K is higher than F).\nStep 5: Place K on the top shelf (since it's higher than F, which is on the middle shelf).\nStep 6: Place G on the bottom shelf (the only remaining position).\nTherefore, H and M are on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).\n"

I is on the middle shelf.\n3. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So F and M must be on the bottom shelf (since the middle shelf is taken by I). This puts K on the top shelf.\n4. So far we have:\n   Top: O, K\n   Middle: I\n   Bottom: H, F, M\n5. The only book left to place is G. We're told more books are on the bottom than the top. So G must go on the bottom to satisfy this condition.\n6. Final arrangement:\n   Top: O, K\n   Middle: I \n   Bottom: H, F, M, G\nLooking at the choices, H and M are indeed on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
