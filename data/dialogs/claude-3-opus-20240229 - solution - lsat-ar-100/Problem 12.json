The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of houses that CANNOT be shown consecutively in either order?\nChoices:\n  A: J, K\n  B: J, M\n  C: J, O\n  D: J, P\n  E: M, P\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe problem states that J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be either the 6th or 7th house shown.\nIt also states that K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in either the afternoon (3rd, 4th, or 5th) or evening (6th or 7th).\nSince J is always in the evening and K is never in the morning, there is no way for J and K to be shown consecutively. If K is shown in the afternoon, it will not be next to J. If K is shown in the evening, it can only be 6th if J is 7th, or 7th if J is 6th.\nTherefore, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order, making [REDACTED] the correct answer.\n"
