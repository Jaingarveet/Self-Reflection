        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven:\n - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom)\n - At least 2 books are on each shelf\n - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf\n - I is on the middle shelf\n - K is on a higher shelf than F\n - O is on a higher shelf than L\n - F is on the same shelf as M\nStep 1: I is on the middle shelf.\nStep 2: The bottom shelf has at least 3 books, the middle shelf at least 2, and the top shelf exactly 2.\nStep 3: F and M are together on either the middle or bottom shelf.\nStep 4: K is on either the top or middle shelf, above F and M.\nStep 5: O is above L. L cannot be on the top shelf, so it must be on the middle or bottom.\nStep 6: Since L is below O, and F and M are together below K, the only consistent arrangement is:\n        - Top: K, O\n        - Middle: I and 1 other book\n        - Bottom: F, M, L and at least 1 other book\nTherefore, O must be on a higher shelf than M.\n"
