        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?\nChoices:\n  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu\n  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu\n  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn\n  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu\n  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's go through each choice again, carefully applying all the rules:\nChoice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 3 as Young (#1) is assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson (#4).\nChoice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 1 as Togowa (#2) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3). \nChoice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 2 as Souza (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Xu (#3).\nChoice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 3. Since Robertson must be higher than Young, and Young must be higher than Togowa, Robertson must also be higher than Togowa. But here Robertson (#2) is lower than Togowa (#1).\nChoice [REDACTED]: Satisfies all the rules:\n- Young (#3) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa (#2). \n- Xu (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza (#1).\n- Robertson (#4) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3).\n- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is allowed.\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED].\n"
