Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- The veterinarian is in space 5.\n- The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n- The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.\nTherefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and a restaurant must be in space 1.\nThe two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.\nWith a restaurant in space 1, the second restaurant could be in space 4 or space 6.\nLooking at the answer choices, only [REDACTED] is a must be true statement. [REDACTED] restaurant must be in space 4.\n"

The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 6 or space 4.\n3. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, with a restaurant at the other end. This means the pharmacy must actually be in space 7, and a restaurant must be in space 1.\n4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. With a restaurant in space 1, the second restaurant could be in space 4 or space 6. \n5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian in space 5. So the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6.\n6. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A. We don't know where the optometrist is. \n   B. Yes, the pharmacy must be in space 7.\n   C. The second restaurant could be in space 4 or 6, but it doesn't have to be in space 4.\n   D. We don't know where the shoe store is.\n   E. The toy store cannot be in space 3 next to the veterinarian.\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is B - the pharmacy is in space 7.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
