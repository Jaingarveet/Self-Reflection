At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- 8 books total: F, G, [REDACTED], K, L, M, O\n- 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom\n- At least 2 books per shelf\n- More books on bottom than top\n- I on middle shelf\n- K on higher shelf than F\n- O on higher shelf than L\n- F on same shelf as M\n- G on top shelf\nIf G is on the top shelf:\n1. I must be on the middle shelf.\n2. K must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as K is higher than F).\n3. L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (as O is higher than L).\n4. F and M must be together on the middle or bottom shelf.\n5. O must be on the middle or top shelf (as O is higher than L).\nLooking at the answer choices with this information:\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible (at least 2 books per shelf)\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED], L - Possible \n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible (K and L can be on middle with I, F and M can be on bottom with H and O, G on top)\n[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible (F and M must be on the same shelf, which can't be the middle as I is there)\nTherefore, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] could be a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf, with [REDACTED] being the correct answer that I previously eliminated.\n"

K must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as K is higher than F).\n4. L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (as O is higher than L). \n5. F and M must be together on the middle or bottom shelf.\n6. O must be on the middle or top shelf (as O is higher than L).\nNow let's look at each answer choice:\nA. H, I - This is possible. I is on the middle shelf, and H could be there too.\nB. I, L - This is not possible, as there must be at least 2 books per shelf.\nC. H, I, L - This is possible. I is on the middle shelf, and H and L could be there too, satisfying all conditions.\nD. I, K, L - This is the correct answer I previously eliminated. It's possible for K and L to be on the middle shelf with I, while F and M are on the bottom shelf with the remaining books, and G is on the top shelf alone. This satisfies all conditions.\nE. F, I, M - This is not possible, as F and M must be on the same shelf, which can't be the middle shelf since I is there.\nTherefore, upon further reflection, the correct answer is D: I, K, L could be a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
