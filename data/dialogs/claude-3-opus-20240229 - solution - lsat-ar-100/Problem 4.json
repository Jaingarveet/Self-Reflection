Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions on the same day.\n2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she must lead either a Thursday or Friday session.\n3. If Lan leads a Thursday or Friday session, then [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday session (because they can't be on the same day).\n4. [REDACTED]'s session must be earlier in the week than [REDACTED]'s. Since [REDACTED] is on Wednesday, [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday morning session.\n5. [REDACTED] must lead an afternoon session. The only remaining afternoon session is on Friday.\n6. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions on the same day, which must be Thursday since Wednesday and Friday are fully booked.\nTherefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session.\n"
