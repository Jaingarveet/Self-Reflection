However, I can answer the question for you. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nThe question is asking about the year in which a mental health program was started, but it does not provide any additional information about the program or its location. Therefore, we must rely on our general knowledge to answer the question. None of the choices provide any specific clues, so we must rely on our general knowledge. Mental health programs have been implemented in various countries at different times, so we cannot rely on a specific location to answer the question. However, we can make an educated guess based on the available choices. Among the choices, 1982 seems too early for a mental health program to be implemented on a large scale, while 1995 seems too late. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and D. This leaves us with choices B and C. Between these two, 1987 seems like a more plausible year for a mental health program to be started. Therefore, the best answer is B: 1987."
