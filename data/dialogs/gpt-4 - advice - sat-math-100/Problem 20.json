We can do this by using the method of elimination or substitution. \nFirst, we can multiply the first equation by 0.5 and the second equation by 1.5 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:\n1.2x - 0.75y = 0.15\n2.4x + 0.75y = -1.95\nThen, we can add the two equations together to eliminate y:\n3.6x = -1.8\nFinally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.6:\nx = -1.8 / 3.6 = -0.5\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
