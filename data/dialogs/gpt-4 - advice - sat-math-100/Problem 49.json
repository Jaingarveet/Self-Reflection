To solve for 'a', we can equate the numerators and the denominators on both sides of the equation since the denominators are already the same. \nThe numerator on the left side is 24x^2 + 25x - 47 and on the right side is -8x - 3. Equating these gives us the quadratic equation 24x^2 + 33x - 44 = 0.\nThe denominator on the left side is ax - 2 and on the right side is ax - 2. Equating these gives us a = a, which doesn't help us find the value of 'a'.\nSolving the quadratic equation 24x^2 + 33x - 44 = 0 using the quadratic formula gives us x = [-33 ± sqrt((33)^2 - 4*24*(-44))]/(2*24). \nWe know that x ≠ 2/a, so we substitute x = 2/a into the solutions for x and solve for 'a'. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
