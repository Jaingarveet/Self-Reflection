        "content": "Thought: \nAlan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. Since his car can travel 25 miles per gallon, this means he wants to drive 1.25 * 25 = 31.25 miles less each week. So, we need to find an equation that represents this situation. \nThe equation should be set up as follows: (miles driven)/(miles per gallon) = gallons used. We want to find the number of miles, m, that corresponds to 1.25 gallons less. So, the equation should be m/25 = 1.25, which simplifies to m = 31.25. \nLooking at the answer choices, none of them match this equation. However, if we multiply both sides of our equation by 4/25 (the cost per mile), we get (4/25)m = 5, which matches choice D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
