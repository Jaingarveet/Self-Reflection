The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Here, the points are (2, k) and (k, 32). So, the slope is (32 - k) / (k - 2). This slope should be equal to the slope of the line passing through the origin, which is k/2. So, we have the equation (32 - k) / (k - 2) = k/2.\nSolving this equation for k, we get k = 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
