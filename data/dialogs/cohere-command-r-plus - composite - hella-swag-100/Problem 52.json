[step] One of the most critical aspects to being indie is not adopting other people's views without evaluating the situation yourself. Going with the crowd is never something that an indie person would do, so make sure that you are making independent decisions when it comes to music, clothing, and your opinions.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Understand how people may affect how you think about the music and related trends. [title] Steer clear of the \" what's indie, what's indie-animal \" mentality.\n  B: Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. [substeps] If you like a band or musician, but everyone else thinks they are bad or weird, then you should stand up for your views.\n  C: [substeps] Never allow the messenger back into your life. If you are in a relationship with someone but they are choosing to change with you, leave the conversation.\n  D: You don't have to assume how you will feel. What's more, you probably know a bit more about people who just want to blend in with their surroundings.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the text's message about independent thinking and overlooked the importance of forming one's opinions. \nI focused on the influence of others (choice A) rather than the need to inform one's views through research (choice B). \nError Keywords:\n- Interpretation error\n- Misinterpretation\n- Omission error\n- Overlooking critical information\nSolution:\nThe text encourages independent thinking and decision-making, which is a core aspect of an indie persona. \nWhile choice [REDACTED] discusses understanding the influence of others on trends, it does not emphasize forming one's opinions, which is crucial to the text's message. \nChoice [REDACTED] completes the text effectively by encouraging readers to do their research to inform their opinions, even if those opinions go against the grain. \nThis aligns with the text's message of evaluating situations independently and making decisions free from conformity. \nInstructions:\n1. Read and understand the text's main message about independent thinking and decision-making.\n2. Identify which choice best captures the essence of forming one's opinions through research and critical thinking.\n3. Recognize that the text encourages a deeper understanding and evaluation beyond simply following trends or the crowd.\n4. Choose the answer that empowers readers to think for themselves and make informed decisions.\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and main message of the text.\n- Focus on the aspect of independent thinking and decision-making.\n- Emphasize the formation of one's opinions through critical evaluation and research.\n- Recognize the difference between understanding influences (external focus) and forming one's opinions (internal process).\n- Choose the answer that empowers readers to think critically and make informed, independent decisions.\n"
