[substeps] If you do not want to use a forked stick, you can use coat hanger, two wire rods, or a pendulum as a dowsing rod.\n  C: You will buy one in a hardware store or hunting store. [substeps] Dowsing or divining rods are no different than sticks, and will require signatures on the stick, such as a helix, that you'll use to figure out how to cast your spells.\n  D: These cast sparks, and are useful tools for lighting up a fire.
