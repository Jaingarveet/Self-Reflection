In this scenario, the heat from the stove burner is transferred to the pan, and then to the soup through convection currents. The soup, being a fluid, can move and carry heat, thus heating itself through convection. The pan and spoon are solids, so heat transfer to them is through conduction.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
