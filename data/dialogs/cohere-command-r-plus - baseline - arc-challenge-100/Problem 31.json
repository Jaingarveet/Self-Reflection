It has not consumed even a significant fraction of its hydrogen fuel yet, so it is incorrect to say that it has consumed \"one-half\" (this may be true for some other stars at a more advanced stage). The Sun is also not near the end of its life, as it has enough fuel to continue shining for another 5 billion years or so. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the Sun is in its infancy in terms of energy consumption.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
