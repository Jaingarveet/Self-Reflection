Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable.\n  B: Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones.\n  C: It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty.\n  D: Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\n  E: Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect answer format\n* Did not state the answer in the form of \"Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")\"\n"

I'll make sure to follow the instructions correctly this time.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nThe main conclusion drawn in the argument is that personal conflicts are not inevitable, as stated in choice D. The counselor argues that people often assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is not necessarily true. The counselor also explains that people tend to ascribe bad qualities to others more easily than good qualities, which can lead to personal conflicts. Therefore, choice D accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nIn choice A, the statement \"Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable\" is mentioned, but it is not the main conclusion of the argument.\n\nIn choice B, the statement \"Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones\" is a supporting detail for the argument, but it is not the main conclusion.\n\nIn choice C, the statement \"It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty\" is a specific example used to support the argument, but it is not the main conclusion.\n\nIn choice E, the statement \"Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction\" is a supporting detail for the argument, but it is not the main conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D, \"Personal conflicts are not inevitable.\""
