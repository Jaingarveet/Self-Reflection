On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

I mistakenly assumed that the editorial was arguing that the political party's policy was inconsistent, when in fact, it was arguing that the party's policy was inconsistent.\n\nThe correct answer is A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n\nThe argument in the editorial depends on assuming that if a legislator claims that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, then they should not vote against increasing spending on education. This assumption is reasonable because if a goal is worthy, then it makes sense to take action to achieve it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\nI hope this helps!
