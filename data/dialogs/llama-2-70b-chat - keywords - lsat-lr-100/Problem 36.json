The correct answer is E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.\nThe argument depends on the assumption that native speakers' perceptions of their own language may not be entirely accurate, and that non-native speakers may have a different perception of the language that is not an illusion. The fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound suggests that the perception of distinct words in a language may not be entirely accurate and that the distinction between words may be a result of the way our brains process language. Therefore, option E is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
