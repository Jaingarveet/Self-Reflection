        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights.\n  B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n  C: Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread.\n  D: In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.\n  E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Incorrect answer choice\n* Failure to provide answer in correct format\n"

I'll make sure to follow the instructions correctly this time.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I selected answer choice A, which is not supported by the information provided. The passage states that the rate of cabin air replenishment has decreased since 1985, which suggests that airborne illnesses may be more likely to spread. Therefore, the best answer is B: People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with."
