The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\n  B: The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book.\n  C: Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience.\n  D: Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895.\n  E: According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n\n* Coincidence\n* Shared source\n* Independent creation\n"

        "content": "  I apologize for my previous mistake. Upon reflection, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I mistakenly thought that the issue at hand was the possibility of independent creation, but that's not what the question asks.\n\nThe correct answer is choice A: \"A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.\"\n\nThis answer choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the metaphor in question may have been independently created by both Jordan and Grey, as they both had access to the same source. It implies that the metaphor was not unique to Jordan's book, as there was a previous work that contained the same metaphor. Therefore, it's possible that Grey was not necessarily influenced by Jordan's book, and the similarity in metaphors could be a coincidence or due to both authors drawing from the same shared source.\n\nMy previous answer, choice E, \"According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors,\" does not weaken the argument. It may suggest that Grey was capable of creating original metaphors, but it doesn't address the specific metaphor in question or provide any evidence that Grey did not borrow it from Jordan's book.\n\nI hope this corrected answer and explanation help clarify the issue."
