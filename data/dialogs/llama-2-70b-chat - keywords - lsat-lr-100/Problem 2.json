However, upon reflection, I realized that the statement \"This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival\" is not necessarily true. Just because most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals, it does not mean that most of the Canadian films shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n\nThe correct answer is choice C: \"Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\" This statement logically follows from the given information, as we know that some of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. Therefore, it is possible that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n\nI hope this revised answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further error or clarification needed."
