After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realize that I misunderstood the question and chose the wrong answer.\nIn this question, Susan is responding to Yuriko's suggestion that her city should imitate Yuriko's city's campaign to persuade parents to have their children vaccinated. Susan points out that most of the increase in vaccinations in Yuriko's city occurred before the campaign really got going, suggesting that the campaign may not be as effective as Yuriko claims.\nThe correct answer is (B) She cites facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation. Susan is challenging Yuriko's evidence by pointing out that the increase in vaccinations may be due to other factors, such as the opening of free neighborhood health clinics, rather than the campaign itself.\nTherefore, the answer is (B) She cites facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
