In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly.\nQuestion: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious.\n  B: It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.\n  C: It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school.\n  D: It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.\n  E: It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends.\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting answer A.\nUpon reflection, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect because the argument in the question stem does not contain any information about the percentage of safe drivers in West Ansland.\nThe correct answer is answer B, since it contains a similar logical flaw to the argument in the question stem.\nIn the argument in the question stem, the conclusion that most people in Hallstown buy prepared frozen dinners regularly is based on the premise that most people in Hallstown shop for groceries no more than three times a month.\nHowever, this premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion, as there are other factors that could affect whether someone buys prepared frozen dinners regularly.\nSimilarly, in answer B, the conclusion that John cannot drive is based on the premise that he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive.\nHowever, this premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion, as there are other factors that could affect whether someone can drive, such as their ability to drive a car that is not their own.\nTherefore, answer B is the correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
