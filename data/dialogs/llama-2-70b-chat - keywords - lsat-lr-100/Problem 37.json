So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting.\nQuestion: Smith's statements can most directly be used as part of an argument for which one of the following views?\nChoices:\n  A: A democratic government does not infringe on the rights of any of its citizens.\n  B: Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.\n  C: News programs for children would give them enough information to enable them to vote in an informed way.\n  D: If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted.\n  E: If parents do not adequately represent their children's interests in the political sphere, those interests will be adequately represented by someone else.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

I selected option A, which is not directly related to Smith's statements. Smith's argument is focused on the limitations of children's voting rights, and option A is a broader statement about democratic governments not infringing on citizens' rights.\n\nUpon reflection, I realize that Smith's statements can most directly be used to support option D, which states that if there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted. Smith argues that children's conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, which suggests that they are not yet ready to participate in the democratic process. Therefore, option D is the best answer."
