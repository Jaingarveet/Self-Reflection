After reflecting on the problem, I realized that I misunderstood the question and misinterpreted the disagreement between Peter and Yoko.\n\nThe question asks whether Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were. The correct answer is [B] tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were.\n\nPeter argues that children's stories should have clearly immoral characters to teach children the consequences of being bad. Yoko, on the other hand, suggests that children's stories still have immoral characters, but they are not as frightening as they used to be. This indicates that Yoko agrees with Peter that children's stories should have immoral characters, but disagrees with him on the level of frighteningness these characters should elicit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [B] tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were, as Peter and Yoko disagree on the level of frighteningness, but not on the presence of immoral characters in children's stories.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
