After re-reading the question and the options, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\nThe correct answer is option A: \"presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action.\"\nThe political scientist's argument assumes that the only reason for decreasing voter turnout is the belief that politicians cannot solve important problems. However, there may be other factors contributing to voter apathy, such as dissatisfaction with the political process, lack of trust in politicians, or feeling that their vote won't make a difference. The argument does not provide any evidence or justification to support the claim that the belief in the ineffectiveness of government action is the sole cause of decreasing voter turnout. Therefore, option A is the best answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
