However, this doesn't resolve the discrepancy between the increase in recorded tornadoes and the fact that climatic factors haven't changed.\n\nThe correct answer, E, resolves the discrepancy by suggesting that more people are reporting tornadoes now than in the past. This means that the increase in recorded tornadoes could be due to an increase in detection rather than an actual increase in the number of tornadoes.\n\nHere's my revised answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
