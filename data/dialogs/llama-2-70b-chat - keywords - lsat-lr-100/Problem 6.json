After re-reading the question and the available choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting.\n\nThe argument states that some gardening books published by Garden Path Press recommend adding compost to the soil without explaining the difference between hot and cold composting. The conclusion is that these books are flawed. The assumption that supports this conclusion is that an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting. Therefore, choice (C) is the correct answer.\n\nMy previous answer, (E) no gardening book that includes an explanation of at least the basics of composting is flawed, is not correct because it is too broad. The argument only claims that books that recommend adding compost without explaining the difference between hot and cold composting are flawed, not all books that include an explanation of at least the basics of composting.\n\nI hope this corrected answer reflects my improved understanding of the question and the available choices."
