The muscles listed in the choices are:\n   - Temporalis: A muscle of mastication that elevates the mandible (jaw).\n   - Masseter: Another muscle of mastication that elevates and protracts the mandible.\n   - Sternocleidomastoid: A neck muscle that flexes the neck and rotates the head.\n   - Orbicularis oris: A muscle that encircles the mouth and is responsible for lip closure and facial expressions.\n3. Among these muscles, only the orbicularis oris is innervated by the facial nerve. The temporalis, masseter, and sternocleidomastoid are not innervated by the facial nerve.\n4. Therefore, stimulation of the facial nerve during testing would cause contraction of the orbicularis oris muscle.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
