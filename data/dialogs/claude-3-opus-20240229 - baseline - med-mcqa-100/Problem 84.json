The trabecular meshwork is a mesh-like structure in the eye that helps drain the aqueous humor from the eye into the bloodstream. Increasing outflow through the trabecular meshwork can lower intraocular pressure.\n3. Let's consider each drug:\n   A. Timolol is a beta-blocker that reduces aqueous humor production.\n   B. Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that contracts the ciliary muscle, opening the trabecular meshwork and increasing aqueous outflow.\n   C. Brimonidine is an alpha-2 agonist that decreases aqueous production and increases uveoscleral outflow.\n   D. Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that decreases aqueous humor production.\n4. Among the choices, only pilocarpine directly affects the trabecular meshwork to increase aqueous outflow.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
