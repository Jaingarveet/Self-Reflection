Oral antibiotics: While oral antibiotics can be effective for some infections, they may not achieve sufficient concentrations in the eye to effectively treat endophthalmitis.\nB. Intravenous antibiotics: IV antibiotics can achieve higher concentrations in the eye compared to oral antibiotics. However, they still may not reach optimal levels in the vitreous humor, where the infection is located.\nC. Topical antibiotics: Topical eye drops or ointments are useful for superficial eye infections but do not penetrate deeply enough into the eye to effectively treat endophthalmitis.\nD. Intravitreal antibiotics: Direct injection of antibiotics into the vitreous humor allows for high concentrations of the medication to reach the site of infection. This route bypasses the blood-eye barrier, which can limit the penetration of systemic antibiotics.\nConsidering that endophthalmitis is a serious intraocular infection involving the vitreous and/or aqueous humors, the most effective route to deliver high antibiotic concentrations directly to the site of infection is through intravitreal injection.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
