They clearly illustrate patterns, peaks, and dips in data.\nB. Bar chart: Bar charts are good for comparing discrete categories of data, but they may not be the best choice for representing trends over time, as the gaps between bars can make it harder to see the overall pattern.\nC. Histogram: Histograms are used to display the distribution of a continuous variable, often grouped into ranges. They are not typically used for showing trends over time.\nD. Pie chart: Pie charts are used to show proportions or percentages of a whole. They do not effectively show changes or trends over time.\nConsidering the options, a line diagram is the most suitable choice for representing trends.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
