The question is asking about an impression material that has the following properties:\n   - Elastic\n   - Sets by a chemical reaction\n   - Catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid\n2. Let's consider each choice:\n   A. Condensation silicone: This is an elastic impression material that sets by a condensation reaction. However, it is not typically catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.\n   B. Polyether: This is an elastic impression material that sets by a cationic ring-opening reaction. It is not catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.\n   C. Polysulfide: This is an elastic impression material that sets by a condensation reaction. It is not catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.\n   D. Poly vinyl siloxane (PVS): This is an elastic impression material that sets by an addition reaction (polymerization). Importantly, PVS impression materials are catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.\n3. Based on the properties listed in the question, the best answer is Poly vinyl siloxane (PVS).\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
