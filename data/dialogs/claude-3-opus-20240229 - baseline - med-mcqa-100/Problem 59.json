Kartagener's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cilia, which are the tiny hair-like structures that line the airways and other organs.\n2. The main features of Kartagener's syndrome are:\n   - Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD): The cilia do not function properly, leading to chronic respiratory infections.\n   - Situs inversus: The internal organs are positioned in a mirror image of their normal locations.\n   - Bronchiectasis: The airways become abnormally widened and damaged due to chronic infections.\n3. Pancreatic insufficiency is not a typical feature of Kartagener's syndrome. It is more commonly associated with cystic fibrosis, another genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
