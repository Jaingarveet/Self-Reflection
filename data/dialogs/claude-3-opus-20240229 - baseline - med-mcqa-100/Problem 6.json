Ca+2 efflux in cell: Calcium efflux from cells is a consequence of cell injury and necrosis, not the primary cause.\nB. Fat deposition in cells: While fat accumulation can lead to cell dysfunction, it is not a direct cause of necrosis.\nC. Water imbibition in cells: Water influx into cells (cellular swelling) is a feature of cell injury, but it is not the primary cause of necrosis.\nD. Enzymatic digestion: During necrosis, there is a loss of membrane integrity, leading to an influx of calcium. This calcium influx activates enzymes like phospholipases, proteases, and endonucleases, which break down cell components. The enzymatic digestion of cellular contents is a key feature of necrosis.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nEnzymatic digestion is the primary cause of cell necrosis among the given choices."
