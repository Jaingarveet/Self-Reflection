The fontanelles serve as acoustic windows, allowing the ultrasound beam to penetrate the skull and image the brain without the interference of bone.\nAnalyzing the choices:\nA: Open fontanelles - This is the most likely reason for preferring time sector scanning in neonates.\nB: Inexpensive - While cost-effectiveness is an advantage, it is not the primary reason for choosing this technique.\nC: Children more co-operative - Neonates are not necessarily more cooperative, and this is not a major factor in selecting the scanning method.\nD: Better resolution - Time sector scanning provides adequate resolution for neonatal brain imaging, but it is not necessarily better than other imaging modalities.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
