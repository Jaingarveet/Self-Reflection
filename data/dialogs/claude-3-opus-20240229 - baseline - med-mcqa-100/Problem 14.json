In anaerobic conditions (without oxygen), pyruvate is converted to lactate.\n3. During glycolysis, there is a net production of 2 ATP molecules.\n4. In the glycolysis pathway, there are two steps where NAD+ is reduced to NADH:\n   - In the first step, glucose is oxidized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, reducing NAD+ to NADH.\n   - In the second step, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, again reducing NAD+ to NADH.\n5. Therefore, in anaerobic glycolysis, the end products are 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules.\n6. FADH2 is not involved in the glycolysis pathway.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
