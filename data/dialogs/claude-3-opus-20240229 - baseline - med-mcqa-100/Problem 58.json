Rigor mortis - This refers to the stiffening of the body after death due to chemical changes in the muscles. It is not the same as suggilation.\nC. Algor mortis - This refers to the cooling of the body after death as it equilibrates with the ambient temperature. It is not the same as suggilation.\nD. Postmortem staining - This refers to the pooling and settling of blood in the lower portions of the body after death due to gravity, causing a purplish discoloration of the skin. This matches the definition of suggilation.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
