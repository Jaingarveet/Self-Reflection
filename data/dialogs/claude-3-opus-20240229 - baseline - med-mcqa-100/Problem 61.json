Newborns have immature brains, which affects how seizures manifest.\n2. Subtle seizures are the most common type of seizure in newborns. These seizures may involve eye movements, lip smacking, cycling movements of the limbs, or apnea.\n3. Clonic seizures (rhythmic jerking) and tonic seizures (stiffening) are less common in newborns compared to subtle seizures.\n4. Myoclonic seizures (sudden, brief muscle contractions) are also less frequent in newborns than subtle seizures.\nTherefore, the most common type of seizure in newborns is subtle seizures.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
