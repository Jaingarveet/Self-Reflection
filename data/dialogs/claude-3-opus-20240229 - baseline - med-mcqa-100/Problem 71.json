        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Estrogen has a positive feedback effect on luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. This means that high levels of estrogen stimulate the release of LH, leading to the LH surge.\n2. The LH surge typically occurs just before ovulation in the menstrual cycle.\n3. In the follicular phase leading up to ovulation, estrogen levels are rising due to the growing follicle, while progesterone levels remain low.\n4. It is this high estrogen, low progesterone environment that triggers the positive feedback effect on LH, causing the LH surge.\n5. After ovulation, in the luteal phase, both estrogen and progesterone levels are elevated, but this is after the LH surge has already occurred.\nTherefore, the steroid hormone ratio associated with the positive feedback action of estrogen on LH is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\nHigh estrogen : low progesterone"
