Duct carcinoma (choice A) is a malignant condition that can cause nipple discharge, but it is not the most common cause.\n3. Chronic cystic mastitis (choice C) is a benign condition characterized by breast pain and cysts, but it is not typically associated with nipple discharge.\n4. Cystosarcoma phyllodes (choice D) is a rare breast tumor that can be benign or malignant, but it is not a common cause of nipple discharge.\n5. Duct papilloma (choice B) is a benign growth within the milk ducts of the breast. It is the most common cause of spontaneous nipple discharge, particularly when the discharge is bloody.\nTherefore, the most common cause of blood discharge from the nipple is duct papilloma.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
