It is characterized by the presence of crescents in the glomeruli, which are formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells in Bowman's space.\n2. Acute GN (Glomerulonephritis) is usually caused by post-streptococcal infection and typically shows diffuse proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, along with neutrophil infiltration. Crescents are not a typical feature.\n3. Membranous GN is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to subepithelial immune complex deposits. Crescents are not typically seen.\n4. Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) shows mesangial proliferation and thickening of the capillary walls due to subendothelial deposits. Crescents can be seen in some cases of MPGN, but they are not the defining feature.\nTherefore, the condition that characteristically shows crescent-shaped deposits under light microscope is RPGN.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
