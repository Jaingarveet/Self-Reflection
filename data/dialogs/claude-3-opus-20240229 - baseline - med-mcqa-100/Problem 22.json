Kim: I am not aware of a widely used root canal isthmus classification by Kim.\nB. Schielder: Schielder is known for his work on root canal preparation techniques, but I don't recall a specific isthmus classification attributed to him.\nC. Krasner and Rankow: Krasner and Rankow published a study in 2004 titled \"Anatomy of the Pulp-Chamber Floor\" in the Journal of Endodontics. In this study, they described the anatomy of the pulp chamber floor and proposed a classification system for canal orifices and isthmuses.\nD. Vertucci: Vertucci is well-known for his root canal morphology classification, which describes the different types of canal configurations. However, this classification does not specifically focus on isthmuses.\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\nKrasner and Rankow are the researchers who have given a widely recognized root canal isthmus classification in their study \"Anatomy of the Pulp-Chamber Floor.\""
