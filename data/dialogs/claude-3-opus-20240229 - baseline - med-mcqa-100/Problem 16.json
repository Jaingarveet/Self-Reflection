        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The axillary artery is the main artery of the upper limb. It is divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle.\n2. If the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb can be maintained by anastomoses (connections) between branches of the axillary artery.\n3. The branches of the second part of the axillary artery are:\n   - Lateral thoracic artery\n   - Thoracoacromial artery\n   - Subscapular artery, which gives off the circumflex scapular artery\n4. The posterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery.\n5. The suprascapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery are not branches of the axillary artery. They arise from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery.\n6. Therefore, the anastomosis that would maintain blood supply in case of obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery is between the subscapular artery (a branch of the second part) and the posterior circumflex humeral artery (a branch of the third part).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
