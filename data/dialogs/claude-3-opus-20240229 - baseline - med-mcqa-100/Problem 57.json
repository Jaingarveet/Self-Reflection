Primary structure: The sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain, held together by covalent peptide bonds.\n2. Secondary structure: The local folding of the polypeptide chain into α-helices, β-sheets, or other patterns, stabilized by hydrogen bonds.\n3. Tertiary structure: The three-dimensional folding of the entire polypeptide chain, stabilized by various interactions such as hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and hydrophobic interactions.\n4. Quaternary structure: The arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a larger protein complex.\nDenaturation is the process by which a protein loses its native conformation and becomes unfolded. During denaturation, the following changes occur:\n- Hydrogen bonds, disulfide bridges, and other non-covalent interactions are disrupted, causing the loss of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.\n- The polypeptide chain unfolds and loses its specific three-dimensional shape.\nHowever, the primary structure (the sequence of amino acids) remains intact during denaturation because the covalent peptide bonds are not broken.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
