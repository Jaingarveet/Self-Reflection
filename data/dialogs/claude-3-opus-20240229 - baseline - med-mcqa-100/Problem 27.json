However, CA-125 can also be elevated in other conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even in normal healthy women.\n3. Therefore, a single cut-off value is used to decide whether a CA-125 level is considered high or normal.\n4. The most widely accepted cut-off value for CA-125 is 35 units/ml.\n5. Levels above 35 units/ml are considered high and may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer or other conditions, while levels below 35 units/ml are considered normal.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
