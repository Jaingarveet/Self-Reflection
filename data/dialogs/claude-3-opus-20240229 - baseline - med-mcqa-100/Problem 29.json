It connects the middle cranial fossa to the pterygopalatine fossa.\n3. The maxillary nerve (V2), which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), passes through the foramen rotundum.\n4. The maxillary artery does not pass through the foramen rotundum. It enters the pterygopalatine fossa through the pterygomaxillary fissure.\n5. The middle meningeal artery enters the skull through the foramen spinosum, not the foramen rotundum.\n6. The spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) does not pass through the foramen rotundum. It exits the skull through the jugular foramen.\nTherefore, the structure passing through the foramen rotundum is the maxillary nerve.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
