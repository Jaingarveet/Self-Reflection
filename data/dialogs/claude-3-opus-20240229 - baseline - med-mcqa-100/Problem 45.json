However, there's no definitive information provided to confirm this choice.\n1995 (Choice D): While it's possible that the mental health program started in the mid-1990s, this seems a bit late compared to the other options, considering the growing focus on mental health in the preceding years.\nWithout more context about the specific mental health program in question, it is challenging to determine the exact year it began. However, based on the progression of mental health awareness and treatment in the late 20th century, 1987 (Choice B) or 1990 (Choice C) seem to be the most likely answers.\nAs the question requires a definitive answer, I will choose the midpoint between these two plausible years.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
