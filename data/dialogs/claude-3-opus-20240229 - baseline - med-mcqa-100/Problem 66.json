It is usually transmitted through the fecal-oral route, meaning that the virus is shed in the feces of an infected person and can be spread to others through contaminated food or water, or close personal contact.\n3. The incubation period (the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms) for Hepatitis A is typically around 28 days, but can range from 15 to 50 days.\n4. Importantly, an infected person is most contagious during the latter half of the incubation period (before symptoms appear) and during the first week of illness.\n5. Therefore, a person with Hepatitis A sheds the virus in their feces primarily from about two weeks before symptoms appear until about one week after symptoms appear.\nBased on this, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
