Kidney: Kidney infarcts are typically pale or white due to the lack of blood flow and subsequent tissue necrosis. Red infarcts are not characteristic of the kidney.\nB. Lung: Lung infarcts are usually hemorrhagic and appear red due to the dual blood supply (pulmonary and bronchial arteries). When pulmonary circulation is blocked, the bronchial arteries can still supply blood, causing a red infarct.\nC. Spleen: Splenic infarcts are typically white or pale due to the lack of blood flow and subsequent tissue necrosis. Red infarcts are not characteristic of the spleen.\nD. Heart: Myocardial infarcts (heart attacks) are usually pale or white due to the lack of blood flow and subsequent tissue necrosis. Red infarcts are not characteristic of the heart.\nBased on this analysis, the organ most likely to have red infarcts is the lung.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
