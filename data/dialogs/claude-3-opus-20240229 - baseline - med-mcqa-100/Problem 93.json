Topical antibiotics (A) are more effective for inflammatory acne, not comedonal acne.\n3. Benzoyl peroxide (B) is an antibacterial agent that can help with mild to moderate acne, but it is not the most effective for comedonal acne.\n4. Retinoids (C), such as topical tretinoin or adapalene, are vitamin A derivatives that help unclog pores, prevent comedone formation, and promote cell turnover. They are considered first-line treatments for comedonal acne.\n5. Estrogen (D) is not a typical treatment for acne. Oral contraceptives containing estrogen and progestin can help with acne in some women, but they are not the first choice for comedonal acne.\nBased on this analysis, the best treatment for comedonal acne in this case would be retinoids.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
