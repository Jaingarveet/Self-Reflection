The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the hydrogen ion concentration [H+].\n2. The formula for pH is: pH = -log10[H+]\n3. In this case, the hydrogen ion concentration [H+] is given as 1 x 10^-6 moles/litre.\n4. Plugging this into the formula:\n   pH = -log10(1 x 10^-6)\n      = -(-6 log10(1))  (using the logarithm property: log(a^b) = b log(a))\n      = -(-6 * 0)      (since log10(1) = 0)\n      = 0 * 6\n      = 6\n5. Therefore, the pH of the solution is 6.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
