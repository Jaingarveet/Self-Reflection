Infundibulum: This is the funnel-shaped distal end of the uterine tube, closest to the ovary. It is relatively wide to capture the ovum released during ovulation.\nB. Ampulla: This is the widest and longest part of the uterine tube, where fertilization usually occurs. It is not the narrowest segment.\nC. Isthmus: This is the narrow, straight segment of the uterine tube that connects the ampulla to the uterus. It is the narrowest part of the uterine tube.\nD. Interstitial: This is the segment of the uterine tube that passes through the uterine wall. While it is relatively narrow, it is not the narrowest part of the tube.\nTherefore, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the isthmus.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
