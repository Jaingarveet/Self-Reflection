        "content": "To determine the sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque, let's consider each choice:\nA. Dextran: Dextran is a complex branched glucan (polysaccharide made of many glucose molecules) produced by certain lactic acid bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, which is a significant contributor to dental plaque formation. Dextran is known for its sticky and adhesive properties, allowing bacteria to adhere to tooth surfaces.\nB. Dextrin: Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch. While they can be found in some food products, they are not typically associated with dental plaque formation.\nC. Glycogen: Glycogen is a polysaccharide that serves as an energy storage molecule in animals and fungi. It is not commonly found in dental plaque or associated with its formation.\nD. Sucrose: Sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose. While sucrose is a substrate for oral bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides like dextran, it is not itself the sticky polysaccharide in dental plaque.\nBased on the information provided, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\nDextran, a complex branched glucan produced by certain oral bacteria like Streptococcus mutans, is the sticky polysaccharide present in dental plaque that contributes to its formation and adhesion to tooth surfaces."
