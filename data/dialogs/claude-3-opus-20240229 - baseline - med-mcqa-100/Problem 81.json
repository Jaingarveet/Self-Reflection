However, CA-125 can also be elevated in other conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even in normal healthy women.\n3. The normal range for CA-125 is typically less than 35 U/ml.\n4. Levels above 35 U/ml are considered elevated and may indicate the presence of ovarian cancer or other conditions.\nTherefore, the upper limit of normal for CA-125 is 35 U/ml.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
