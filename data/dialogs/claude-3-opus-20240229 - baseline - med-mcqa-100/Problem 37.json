Oxytocin is a first-line drug for the prevention and treatment of PPH. It stimulates uterine contractions to help control bleeding.\n3. Ergotamine and its derivatives, like methylergonovine, are also used to control PPH by promoting uterine contractions.\n4. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, is another drug used in managing PPH. It also causes uterine contractions.\n5. Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist used for medical abortion, emergency contraception, and in the treatment of uterine fibroids. It is not commonly used in the management of PPH.\nTherefore, the drug that is not commonly used in PPH is Mifepristone.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
