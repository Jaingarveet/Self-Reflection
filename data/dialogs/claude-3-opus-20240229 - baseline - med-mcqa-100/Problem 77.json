Tirofiban, abciximab, and eptifibatide are all well-known Gp IIb/IIIa antagonists.\n3. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine, which is a different class of antiplatelet drug. It works by irreversibly inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor on platelets.\nTherefore, the drug that is NOT a Gp IIb/IIIa antagonist is prasugrel.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
