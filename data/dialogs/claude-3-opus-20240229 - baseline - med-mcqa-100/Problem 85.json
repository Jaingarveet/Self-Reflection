Keratoderma blenorrhagica is a skin condition characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles, often with pustular lesions.\n2. It is commonly associated with reactive arthritis, which is a type of arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body, most often the genitourinary tract or gastrointestinal tract.\n3. Reactive arthritis is part of a group of conditions known as spondyloarthropathies, which also includes ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. However, keratoderma blenorrhagica is most characteristically seen in reactive arthritis.\n4. Gouty arthritis is a different type of arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints, and is not typically associated with keratoderma blenorrhagica.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
