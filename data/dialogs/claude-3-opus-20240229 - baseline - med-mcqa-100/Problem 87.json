The key symptoms mentioned are salty-tasting skin and progressive pancreatic fibrosis with exocrine gland atrophy and cystic duct dilation.\n2. These symptoms are characteristic of cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene.\n3. CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a chloride channel that regulates the transport of chloride ions across epithelial cell membranes.\n4. In cystic fibrosis, the CFTR protein is either not synthesized correctly, not processed and transported to the cell surface properly, or does not function correctly as a chloride channel.\n5. The basic abnormality is not related to cAMP levels or phosphorylation of the chloride channel.\n6. The most likely answer is that there is a decrease in the functional chloride channel at the cell surface, which could be due to decreased synthesis or improper glycosylation of the CFTR protein.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
