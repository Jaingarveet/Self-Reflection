Each outcome has an equal probability, and the exact probabilities are unknown, ensuring an unbiased process.\nIn randomization, each subject has an equal and independent chance of being assigned to any group. The specific assignment is determined by an unpredictable (unknown) process.\nTherefore, \"random\" in the context of randomization implies equal and unknown chances.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
