The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is responsible for the reabsorption of the majority of the filtered bicarbonate (HCO3-), but it does not significantly contribute to urine acidification.\n3. The loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) also do not play a significant role in urine acidification.\n4. The collecting duct is the principal site of urine acidification. It has two types of cells that are involved in this process:\n   - Type A intercalated cells secrete H+ ions into the lumen via H+-ATPase pumps.\n   - Type B intercalated cells secrete bicarbonate (HCO3-) into the lumen and reabsorb H+ ions.\nTherefore, the principal site of acidification of urine is the collecting duct.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
