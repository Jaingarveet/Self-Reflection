Skin quality: The donor site should have healthy, undamaged skin with good elasticity.\n2. Minimal visibility: The donor site should be in an area that is not easily visible to minimize cosmetic concerns.\n3. Ease of immobilization: The donor site should be in an area that can be easily immobilized to promote healing and prevent graft loss.\n4. Minimal interference with growth: The donor site should not interfere with the child's growth and development.\nConsidering these factors:\nA. Buttocks: This area has good skin quality, is not easily visible, and can be easily immobilized. It also does not interfere with growth.\nB. Thigh: The thigh has good skin quality but is more visible than the buttocks. It can be immobilized but may interfere with the child's mobility.\nC. Trunk: The trunk has good skin quality but is more visible than the buttocks. It may be difficult to immobilize and could interfere with the child's movement.\nD. Upper limb: The upper limb has good skin quality but is highly visible. It may be difficult to immobilize and could interfere with the child's daily activities.\nBased on these considerations, the buttocks would be the best site for harvesting split skin grafts in young children.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
