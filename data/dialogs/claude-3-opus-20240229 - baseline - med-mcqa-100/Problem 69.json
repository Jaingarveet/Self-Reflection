Deficiency can cause depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.\nPhenylalanine: Precursor for tyrosine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Deficiency can cause developmental delays, seizures, and eczema.\nCysteine: Important for protein structure (disulfide bonds), detoxification, and synthesis of glutathione. Deficiency is rare but could impair these functions.\nGlutamine: Key fuel source for intestinal cells and immune system. Deficiency can impair gut barrier function and immune response.\nThe question stem does not provide specific clinical features to differentiate between these deficiencies. More information would be needed to definitively answer the question. However, based on the rarity of cysteine deficiency compared to the other options, cysteine is the least likely answer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
