ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase), AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase), and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) are all enzymes found in the liver. When the liver is damaged or diseased, these enzymes leak into the bloodstream, causing their levels to rise.\n3. Lipase, on the other hand, is an enzyme primarily produced by the pancreas. It helps digest dietary fats. Lipase levels are typically elevated in conditions affecting the pancreas, such as pancreatitis.\n4. While some lipase is produced in the liver, it is not a primary liver enzyme, and its levels are not characteristically elevated in liver disorders.\nTherefore, among the choices given, Lipase is the enzyme not typically raised in liver disorders.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
