        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. An unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida (a woman who has been pregnant more than once) can be caused by various factors that prevent the fetus from settling into a stable position.\n2. Oligohydramnios (choice A) is a condition with decreased amniotic fluid. This can allow the fetus to move more freely and change position, leading to an unstable lie.\n3. Placenta previa (choice B) is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix. This can prevent the fetal head from engaging in the pelvis, potentially causing an unstable lie.\n4. A pelvic tumor (choice C) can obstruct the pelvis and prevent the fetus from descending into a stable position, leading to an unstable lie.\n5. Uterine anomalies (choice D), such as a bicornuate uterus or a septate uterus, can distort the shape of the uterine cavity and prevent the fetus from settling into a stable lie.\nIn conclusion, all of the listed choices - oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, and uterine anomalies - can potentially cause an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
