It runs upward and forward, beneath the Platysma and the Digastric muscles, along the side of the face, to the angle of the mouth.\n3. At the angle of the mouth, the facial artery anastomoses (connects) with the terminal branches of the opposite facial artery.\n4. The facial artery also anastomoses with the infraorbital artery (a branch of the maxillary artery), but this is not its terminal anastomosis.\n5. The transverse facial artery is a branch of the superficial temporal artery, not the facial artery.\n6. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery, not the external carotid artery like the facial artery.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the facial artery terminates in the anastomosis with the opposite side of the facial artery.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
