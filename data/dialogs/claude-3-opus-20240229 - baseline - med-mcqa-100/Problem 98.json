Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the pylorus, the lower part of the stomach that connects to the small intestine, becomes narrowed and thickened.\n2. This narrowing prevents food from passing easily from the stomach into the duodenum, causing projectile vomiting in infants.\n3. On an abdominal X-ray, this obstruction leads to the stomach being filled with air, appearing as a large, single bubble.\n4. The air is trapped in the stomach because it cannot pass through the narrowed pyloric channel.\n5. Double bubble appearance is seen in duodenal atresia, where there is a bubble in the stomach and another in the duodenum.\n6. Multiple air-fluid levels suggest intestinal obstruction lower in the digestive tract, not pyloric stenosis.\nTherefore, the characteristic X-ray finding in pyloric stenosis is a single bubble appearance due to the air trapped in the stomach.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
