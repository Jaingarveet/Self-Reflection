Anagen is the active growth phase. During this phase, the hair follicle is actively producing new hair cells, causing the hair to grow longer. The duration of the anagen phase determines the maximum length of the hair.\n3. Catagen is a short transitional phase that occurs after anagen. During this phase, hair growth stops, and the follicle shrinks.\n4. Telogen is the resting phase. In this phase, the hair follicle is completely at rest, and no new hair growth occurs. The hair remains attached to the follicle but can be easily pulled out.\n5. Exogen (or kenogen) is the phase when the old hair sheds and a new hair begins to grow in the follicle, starting the anagen phase again.\nTherefore, the phase that determines the length to which hair in different body areas can grow is the anagen phase.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
