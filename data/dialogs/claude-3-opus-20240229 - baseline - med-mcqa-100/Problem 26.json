The atlanto-occipital joint is the articulation between the atlas (C1 vertebra) and the occipital bone of the skull. This joint primarily allows for nodding movements (flexion and extension).\n3. The atlanto-axial joint is the articulation between the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2). This joint is responsible for the majority of rotation in the neck.\n4. The C6-C7 and C7-T1 joints are lower in the cervical spine and contribute less to flexion and extension compared to the atlanto-occipital joint.\nTherefore, the majority of flexion and extension in the neck occurs at the atlanto-occipital joint.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
