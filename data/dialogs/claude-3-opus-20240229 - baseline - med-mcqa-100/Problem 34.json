Allergic reactions are typically classified into four types of hypersensitivity reactions (I, II, III, and IV) based on the mechanism involved.\n3. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate allergic reactions mediated by IgE antibodies. They include conditions like allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis.\n4. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions mediated by T cells. They include conditions like contact dermatitis and tuberculosis skin tests.\n5. Spring catarrh is a type of allergic reaction that involves both IgE-mediated (Type I) and T cell-mediated (Type IV) mechanisms.\nTherefore, the correct answer is that spring catarrh involves both Type I and Type IV hypersensitivity reactions.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
