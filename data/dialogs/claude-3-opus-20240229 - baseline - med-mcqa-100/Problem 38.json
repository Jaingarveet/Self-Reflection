The \"cobra head\" appearance is a radiologic sign, typically seen on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or intravenous pyelogram (IVP).\n2. This sign is characterized by a dilated posterior urethra that abruptly narrows, resembling the head of a cobra snake.\n3. The posterior urethral valve is a congenital condition where there is a membrane-like valve in the posterior urethra, causing obstruction to urine flow.\n4. This obstruction leads to dilatation of the posterior urethra proximal to the valve, giving the characteristic \"cobra head\" appearance on imaging.\n5. Rectocele, ureterocele, and bladder tumors can cause urinary obstruction but do not typically present with the \"cobra head\" sign.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\nThe \"cobra head\" appearance is most commonly associated with posterior urethral valves."
