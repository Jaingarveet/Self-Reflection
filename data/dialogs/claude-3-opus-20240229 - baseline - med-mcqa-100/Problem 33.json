        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects mucous membranes.\n2. In this condition, autoantibodies target components of the basement membrane zone (BMZ).\n3. The salt split skin technique is used to differentiate pemphigoid disorders based on the location of IgG binding.\n4. In cicatricial pemphigoid, the target antigens are typically laminin 5 (also known as laminin 332) and BP antigen 2 (also known as type XVII collagen or BP180).\n5. When the salt split skin technique is performed, IgG autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid bind to the epidermal side of the split skin.\n6. Among the given choices, both laminin 5 and type XVII collagen are correct answers, as they are the target antigens in cicatricial pemphigoid and are located on the epidermal side of the split skin.\n7. However, the question asks for a single antigen, and type XVII collagen (choice A) is the most specific answer.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
