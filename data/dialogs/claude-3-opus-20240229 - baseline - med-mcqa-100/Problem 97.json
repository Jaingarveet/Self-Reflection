Many medical definitions and guidelines consider a condition chronic if it lasts for 6 months or longer.\n4. 12 months is also used to define chronic conditions in some cases, but 6 months is more commonly used for defining chronic pelvic pain specifically.\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
