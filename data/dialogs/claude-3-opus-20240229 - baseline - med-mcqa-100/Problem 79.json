So by age 4, the average child would be about 100 cm tall.\n4. The question is asking about the gain in length, not the total length at age 4.\n5. To calculate the gain, we take the length at age 4 (100 cm) and subtract the length at birth (50 cm).\n6. 100 cm - 50 cm = 50 cm\nTherefore, the average gain in length from birth to 4 years old is 50 cm.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
