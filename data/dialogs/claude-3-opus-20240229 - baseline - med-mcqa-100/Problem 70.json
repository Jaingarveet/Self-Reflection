Anesthesia is typically divided into four stages:\n   - Stage 1: Induction\n   - Stage 2: Excitement\n   - Stage 3: Surgical anesthesia\n   - Stage 4: Overdose\n2. In Stage 1 (Induction), the patient begins to lose consciousness but is not yet fully anesthetized.\n3. Stage 2 (Excitement) is characterized by the patient becoming hyperactive, delirious, and potentially violent due to the disinhibiting effect of the anesthetic agents. This stage is also known as the \"delirium\" stage.\n4. In Stage 3 (Surgical anesthesia), the patient is fully anesthetized, and surgery can be safely performed.\n5. Stage 4 (Overdose) occurs when the patient receives an excessive amount of anesthesia, leading to severe cardiovascular and respiratory depression.\nTherefore, the stage in which the patient becomes hyperactive is Stage 2, also known as the Excitement stage.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
