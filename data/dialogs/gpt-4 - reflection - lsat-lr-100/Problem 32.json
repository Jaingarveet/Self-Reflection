On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\n\nThought: \nThe argument in the editorial is pointing out an inconsistency in the political party's stance on education spending. It assumes that if a party believes increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, they should not also argue against increasing spending on education. This is most closely related to choice A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

I focused on the inconsistency between the party's claims and actions, rather than the assumption that a consistent policy does not hold that a worthy goal should not be performed.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Assumption error\n- Logical reasoning error\nSolution:\nThe argument in the editorial is pointing out an inconsistency in the political party's stance on education spending. It assumes that if a party believes increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, they should not also argue against increasing spending on education. This is most closely related to choice D, which states that a consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument being made.\n2. Identify the underlying assumption in the argument.\n3. Match the assumption with the choices given.\n4. Choose the answer that best represents the assumption in the argument.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the argument being made.\n- Try to identify the underlying assumption in the argument.\n- Be careful not to confuse the inconsistency between claims and actions with the assumption in the argument.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your ability to identify assumptions in arguments."
