Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\nQuestion: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.\n  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.\n  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.\n  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.\n\nThought: \nThe flawed reasoning in the original argument is that it assumes that because most mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, then most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for the possibility that some mechanics with extensive experience may not understand electronic circuits. \nThe argument that most closely follows this flawed reasoning is choice A. It assumes that because automobile traffic increases lead to gas price increases and gas price increases lead to consumer complaints, then automobile traffic increases cause consumer complaints. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for other possible causes of consumer complaints.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the flawed reasoning in the original argument. The flaw lies in the assumption that two overlapping groups (auto mechanics with extensive experience and mechanics who understand electronic circuits) represent the majority of all auto mechanics. I incorrectly identified the flaw as not accounting for other possible causes, which led me to choose the wrong answer.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Overlapping groups assumption\nSolution:\nThe original argument assumes that because most auto mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, then most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for the possibility that some mechanics with extensive experience may not understand electronic circuits. \nThe argument that most closely follows this flawed reasoning is choice E.

Understand the flawed reasoning in the original argument.\n2. Identify the assumption made in the original argument.\n3. Compare the assumption in each choice with the assumption in the original argument.\n4. Choose the answer that contains the same flawed reasoning as the original argument.\nAdvice:\n- Always understand the reasoning in the original argument before comparing it with the choices.\n- Identify the assumption made in the original argument.\n- Compare the assumption in each choice with the assumption in the original argument.\n- Choose the answer that contains the same flawed reasoning as the original argument.\n- Don't rush, take your time to understand the logic behind each argument."
