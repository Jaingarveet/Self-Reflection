In most cases, a detailed physical exam and X-rays are enough to diagnose this condition. \nA: Anteroposterior X-ray - This is useful as it can show the alignment of the vertebrae and whether any are out of place.\nB: Lateral view X-ray - This is also useful as it can show if any vertebrae have slipped forward.\nC: CT - A CT scan can provide a more detailed look at the spine and can show if there are any fractures or other problems that could be causing the symptoms.\nD: MRI - An MRI can provide detailed images of the soft tissues and nerves around the spine and can help determine if there are any problems with these structures.\nTherefore, all of the options listed are useful investigations for Spondylolisthesis.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
