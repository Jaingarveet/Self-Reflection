The basic abnormality in cystic fibrosis is a defect in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that functions as a chloride channel and regulates the flow of other ions across the cell membrane. This defect leads to decreased chloride transport and increased sodium absorption, which results in thick, sticky mucus.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
