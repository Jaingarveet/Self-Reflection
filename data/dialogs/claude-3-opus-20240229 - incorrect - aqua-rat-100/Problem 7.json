        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) If Amy uses only single letters, she would need 10 different letters to uniquely code the 10 types of books. \n2) However, Amy can also use pairs of two different letters. Let's see how many letters she would need in this case.\n3) Suppose Amy has n letters. She can make n different single letter codes. \n4) For the pair codes, she can choose any 2 letters from the n letters, and the order doesn't matter. This is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 2 items from n items is given by the formula:\n   $\\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n5) So, the total number of unique codes (single letter + pair codes) is:\n   $n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n6) We need this total to be at least 10 (for the 10 types of books). Let's try some values of n:\n   For n = 3: $3 + \\frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3 + 3 = 6$ (not enough)\n   \n   For n = 4: $4 + \\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 4 + 6 = 10$ (just right!)\n   \n   For n = 5: $5 + \\frac{5(5-1)}{2} = 5 + 10 = 15$ (more than needed)\n7) Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed is 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
