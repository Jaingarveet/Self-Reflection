        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) The question is asking about 5 consecutive odd numbers. Let's represent them as:\n   $n$, $n+2$, $n+4$, $n+6$, and $n+8$, where $n$ is an odd number.\n2) The sum of these numbers is:\n   $n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + 20$\n3) The question states that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Let's call this perfect square $k^2$. So:\n   $(5n + 20) / 10 = k^2$\n   $5n + 20 = 10k^2$\n   $5n = 10k^2 - 20$\n   $n = 2k^2 - 4$\n4) Now, $n$ must be an odd number. For $n$ to be odd, $k$ must be odd. (If $k$ were even, $2k^2$ would be even, and $2k^2 - 4$ would be even.)\n5) The smallest possible odd value for $k$ is 3. (1 would make $n$ negative, which is not a two-digit number.)\n   If $k = 3$, then $n = 2(3^2) - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14$. But this is not a two-digit number.\n   The next odd value for $k$ is 5.\n   If $k = 5$, then $n = 2(5^2) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46$.\n6) So the smallest possible value for $n$ is 47. The 5 consecutive odd numbers would be 47, 49, 51, 53, and 55.\n7) Looking at the answer choices, 47 is present.\nTherefore, the answer is A: 47.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
