        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters. \n   Then the length will be (4x + 1) meters.\n2. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. \n   So, x(4x + 1) = 150\n3. Expanding the equation:\n   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0\n4. Solving this quadratic equation:\n   (4x - 25)(x + 6) = 0\n   So, x = 25/4 or x = -6 \n   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 25/4 = 6.25 m\n5. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(6.25) + 1 = 26 m\n6. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + breadth)\n                            = 2(26 + 6.25) \n                            = 2(32.25)\n                            = 64.5 m\nThe closest option to 64.5 m is 64 m.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
