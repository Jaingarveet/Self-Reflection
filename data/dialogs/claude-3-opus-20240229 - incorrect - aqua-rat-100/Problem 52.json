        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means in 15 parts of alloy X, 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper.\n   - In 40 grams of alloy X, there are (40 * 6/15) = 16 grams of zinc and (40 * 9/15) = 24 grams of copper.\n2. In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means in 18 parts of alloy Y, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. \n   - In 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (60 * 7/18) = 23.33 grams of zinc and (60 * 11/18) = 36.67 grams of copper.\n3. In the new alloy Z formed by mixing 40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y:\n   - Total zinc = 16 + 23.33 = 39.33 grams\n   - Total copper = 24 + 36.67 = 60.67 grams\n4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33 : 60.67. \n   Simplifying this ratio, we get 59 : 91.\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 59:91.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
