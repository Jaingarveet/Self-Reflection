In other words, the number of students who took physics must be a whole number. \n   Let this number be p.\n   p = 0.20x\n   For p to be a whole number, x must be a multiple of 5.\n3) Similarly, 28% took math. The number of math students, m, must also be a whole number.\n   m = 0.28x\n   For m to be a whole number, x must be a multiple of 25.\n4) So, x must be a multiple of both 5 and 25. In other words, x must be a multiple of their least common multiple (LCM).\n   LCM(5, 25) = 25\n5) The least value of x that satisfies both conditions (x > 501 and x is a multiple of 25) is 525.\nHowever, 525 is not one of the given choices. The least possible value from the given choices is 550.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
