        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1) The company produces 420 components per month. So in a year, they produce:\n   420 * 12 = 5040 components\n2) The production cost per component is $110. So the total yearly production cost is:\n   5040 * $110 = $554,400\n3) They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Profit is revenue minus costs. \n   So if we let the selling price per component be x, then we need:\n   (5040 * x) - $554,400 >= $626,400\n4) Solving this inequality:\n   5040x - 554400 >= 626400\n   5040x >= 1180800\n   x >= 1180800 / 5040\n   x >= 234.29\n5) So the minimum selling price needs to be at least $234.29. \n   Looking at the choices, the first price that's at least this much is $240.\nTherefore, the minimum selling price that guarantees the desired profit is $240.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
