This means there are two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim:\n   - Susan, Tim\n   - Susan, _, Tim\n   where _ represents the empty chair.\n3) Now for each of those 2 arrangements, we consider where Zen could sit:\n   For Susan, Tim:\n   - Zen, Susan, Tim\n   - Susan, Tim, Zen\n   For Susan, _, Tim: \n   - Susan, Zen, Tim\n4) Counting up the total number of possible arrangements, we get 3.\nTherefore, there are 3 ways to arrange the children meeting the given requirements.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
