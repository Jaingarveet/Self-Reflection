        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The space shuttle travels 700m high in 40 seconds at maximum speed.\n2. To find the speed, we divide the distance by the time:\n   Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s\n3. Now, we know it takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point. \n4. Since speed = distance / time, we can rearrange this to:\n   distance = speed * time\n   \n5. We know the speed is 17.5 m/s and the time to pass a point is 5 seconds.\n   So, the length of the shuttle is:\n   length = 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 meters\n6. Looking at the choices, 87.5 meters rounds to 90 meters, which is not an option.\n   The closest option is 75 meters.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
