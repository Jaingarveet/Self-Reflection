        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1) The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:\n   Area of square = 20 * 20 = 400 cm^2\n2) Two semicircles are cut out from opposite sides. The area removed is equal to the area of a full circle with diameter 20 cm. \n   \n   The radius of this circle is 10 cm (half the diameter).\n   Area of circle = π * r^2\n                  = π * 10^2 \n                  = 100π cm^2\n3) The remaining area is the area of the square minus the area of the circle:\n   Remaining area = 400 - 100π\n                  = 400 - 314.159...\n                  ≈ 85.84 cm^2\n4) Looking at the choices, the closest value is 8.58. However, this is not one of the options.\n   The question asks for the area in square form, which likely means rounded to two decimal places.\n   Rounding 85.84 to two decimal places gives 85.84 ≈ 85.84.\n5) 85.84 is still not one of the choices. The choices seem to be around 8.7, which is about 1/10 of our answer.\n   It's possible there was an error in the question or the choices. Without more information, I don't have enough to definitively choose one of the given options.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\nI chose E because 8.72 is the closest to 1/10 of 85.84, which is 8.584. However, I'm not fully confident in this answer due to the discrepancy between my calculated result and the given choices. The question or choices may contain an error."
