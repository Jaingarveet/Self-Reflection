To calculate the profit per bag:\n   * 25% of $100 = 0.25 * $100 = $25 profit per bag\n4. The grocer made a total profit of $3,000\n5. To calculate the number of bags sold:\n   * Total profit / Profit per bag\n   * $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags\nTherefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.\nLooking at the answer choices, 120 bags is not an option. The closest answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
