When rowing against the current, the man's effective speed is his rowing speed minus the current speed. So:\n   4 - x = 2\n   Solving this, x = 2 kmph. The current speed is 2 kmph.\n3. When rowing with the current, the man's speed will be his rowing speed plus the current speed. So his speed along the current is:\n   4 + 2 = 6 kmph\nTherefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
