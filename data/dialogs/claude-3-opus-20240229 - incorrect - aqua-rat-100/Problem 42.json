        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are x pickets in total.\n   So the total width of all the pickets is (1/2)x inches.\n2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. \n   There is one less space than the number of pickets.\n   So the total space between pickets is 6(x-1) inches.\n3) The total length of the fence is the width of the pickets plus the space between them.\n   Total length = (1/2)x + 6(x-1) inches\n                = (1/2)x + 6x - 6 inches\n                = (13/2)x - 6 inches\n4) We need to convert the length from inches to feet.\n   There are 12 inches in a foot.\n   So dividing the length in inches by 12 gives the length in feet:\n   Length in feet = ((13/2)x - 6) / 12\n                  = (13x - 12) / 24 feet\nLooking at the answer choices, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
