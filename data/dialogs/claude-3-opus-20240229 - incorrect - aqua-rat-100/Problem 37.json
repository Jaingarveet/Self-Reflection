        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let the total number of matches played by Sachin be x.\n2. His current average is 51. Let his current total runs be R. Then:\n   R / x = 51\n   R = 51x\n3. In the finals, he scores 78 more runs. So his new total is R + 78.\n4. His new average is 54. So:\n   (R + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n5. Substituting R = 51x:\n   (51x + 78) / (x + 1) = 54\n6. Cross multiply:\n   51x + 78 = 54x + 54\n7. Simplify:\n   78 = 3x + 54\n   24 = 3x\n   x = 8\nTherefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
