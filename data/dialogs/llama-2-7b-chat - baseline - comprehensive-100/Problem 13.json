If the team doesn't go to E city, they cannot go to H mountain.\n\nB: The group went to city E instead of city F.\nThis is not a possible scenario as per condition (2).

The team can visit both G Lake and H Mountain if they don't go to I Peak.\n\nD: The group went to F city and G lake tour.\nThis is not a possible scenario as per condition (2).
