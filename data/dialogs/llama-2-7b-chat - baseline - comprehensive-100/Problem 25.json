Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n"

The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it cannot be in spaces 1, 3, or 5.\n2. One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it cannot be in spaces 1, 3, or 5.\n3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.\n4.

The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in spaces 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBased on these constraints, we can eliminate the following orders:\n\n* A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant (violates constraint 1)\n* B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant (violates constraint 2)\n* C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant (violates constraint 3)\n\nSo, the possible orders are:\n\n* E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy (meets all constraints)\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
