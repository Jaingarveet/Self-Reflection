Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\n"

        "content": "  Thought: Let's analyze the constraints given in the problem:\n\n1. The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so there are only two possible locations for it - spaces 1 or 7.\n2. One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so there are only two possible locations for it - spaces 3 or 6.\n3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the only possible locations for the second restaurant are spaces 3, 5, or 7.\n4. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the only possible locations for the pharmacy are spaces 1 or 7.\n5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the only possible locations for the toy store are spaces 2, 4, or 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: The optometrist is in space 5, which is not possible since the optometrist must be next to either the pharmacy or the veterinarian, and space 5 is not adjacent to either of them.\n\nB: The pharmacy is in space 1, which is possible since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and space 1 is one of the two possible locations for it.\n\nC: A restaurant is in space 3, which is possible since one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row and space 3 is one of the two possible locations for it.\n\nD: The toy store is in space 6, which is possible since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, and space 6 is one of the possible locations for it.\n\nE: The veterinarian is in space 4, which is not possible since the veterinarian must be next to either the optometrist or the pharmacy, and space 4 is not adjacent to either of them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The toy store is in space 6."
