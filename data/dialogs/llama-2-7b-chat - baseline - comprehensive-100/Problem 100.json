The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a testicular tumor, which is a type of adenocarcinoma. The dilated blood vessels draining the left testicle are a common feature of testicular tumors, and the patient's history of hyperlipidemia and nodular prostatic hyperplasia increase their risk of developing a testicular tumor."
