Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year.\n  B: In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65.\n  C: As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.\n  D: In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers.\n  E: Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town.\n"

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"E\")\n\nThe correct answer is (E) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town. This information weakens the argument that violent crime in the town is becoming a serious problem because it suggests that the root cause of the issue is not the overall number of violent crimes, but rather the actions of a small group of repeat offenders. If the town can identify and address the issues surrounding these repeat offenders, it may be able to reduce the overall number of violent crimes in the area."
