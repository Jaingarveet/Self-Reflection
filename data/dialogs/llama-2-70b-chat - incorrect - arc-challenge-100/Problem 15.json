However, I can give you the correct answer and explain why it is the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nThe statement that describes why the snack is a mixture is \"It is made up of more than one substance.\" A mixture is a physical combination of two or more substances in which each substance retains its chemical properties. In this case, the snack contains peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces, which are all different substances. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nIt's important to note that option C is incorrect because the components of a mixture do not necessarily retain their original properties. For example, when you mix sand and water, the sand becomes wet and the water becomes dirty. Option D is also incorrect because the components of a mixture do not chemically combine with each other. If they did, it would be a chemical reaction, not a mixture. Option B is not a correct description of a mixture, as it is possible to separate the substances in a mixture, although it may be difficult or time-consuming."
