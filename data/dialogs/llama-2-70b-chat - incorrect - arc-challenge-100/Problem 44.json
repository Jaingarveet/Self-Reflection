However, I can give you a brief explanation of the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is option B: The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.\n\nWhen the toy car rolls down the inclined track, the force of gravity acting on it is greater than the normal force exerted on it by the track, causing it to accelerate downward. However, when the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the force of gravity acting on it is less than the normal force exerted on it by the track, causing it to slow down and eventually come to a stop.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer. The force of gravity acting on the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface, causing its speed to decrease."
