However, I can use my knowledge of science to answer the question.\n\nThe process that is most directly related to constructing new land is deposition. Deposition is the process of sediment or rock particles settling out of water or air and accumulating in a new location, such as a river delta or ocean shore. Over time, this accumulation can form new land, such as islands, peninsulas, or even entire continents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
