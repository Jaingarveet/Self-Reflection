Weight and mass are often used interchangeably in everyday language, but they are different physical quantities. Mass is the amount of matter in an object and is typically measured in kilograms (kg) or grams (g). On the other hand, weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity and is measured in newtons (N) or pounds (lb).\n\nThe weight of an object on the moon would be about one-sixth of its weight on Earth because the moon's surface gravity is about one-sixth of the Earth's. However, the mass of the object would remain the same regardless of its location.\n\nTherefore, if the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, his weight on the Earth would be approximately 84 x 9.8 = 839 newtons or 186 pounds. His weight on the moon would be approximately 84 x 1.6 = 134 newtons or 31 pounds.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be:\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes that the astronaut's mass is 84 kilograms. If this value is incorrect, the calculations will also be incorrect."
