Instead, I should have focused on isolating the variable $w$ by multiplying by the reciprocal of the coefficient. By doing so, I would have multiplied the coefficient and the fraction by their reciprocal, effectively canceling them out and leaving $w$ by itself. This would have given me the correct value for $w$.\n\nThought: \nGiven equation: $\\frac{3}{5} w = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nTo isolate $w$, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of $\\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\\frac{5}{3}$.\n\n$\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{5} w\\right) = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)$.\n\nSimplifying the left side: $\\frac{5}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 1$, so we have $w = \\frac{5}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nNow, multiply the fractions: $w = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 3} = \\frac{20}{9}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
