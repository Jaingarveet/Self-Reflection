I incorrectly calculated the value inside the square root as $6\\sqrt{6}$ instead of $6\\sqrt{2}$. This mistake propagated through the rest of the calculation, leading to an incorrect final answer. To avoid this in the future, I need to be more careful when performing calculations and check my work thoroughly before finalizing my response."
