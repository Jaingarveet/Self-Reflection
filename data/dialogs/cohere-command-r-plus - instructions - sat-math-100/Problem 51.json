        "content": "Reflection: I misread the question and calculated $y - x$ instead of $x - y$.\n\nSolution:\n1. To solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method. First, we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n3(2 x-3 y)&=3(-14) \\\\\n6 x-9 y&=-42\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n2(3 x-2 y)&=2(-6) \\\\\n6 x-4 y&=-12\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n2. Now, we can add the two equations to eliminate $x$:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n6 x-9 y+6 x-4 y &= -42-12 \\\\\n12 x-13 y &= -54\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n3. Next, we divide the entire equation by 13 to solve for $y$:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{12}{13} x-\\frac{13}{13} y &= \\frac{-54}{13} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{12}{13} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2}-\\frac{54}{13} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{30}{26}-\\frac{54}{13} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{15-54}{13} \\\\\ny &= \\frac{-39}{13} \\\\\ny &= -3\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n4. Now that we have the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into one of the original equations to find $x$:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n2 x-3(-3) &= -14 \\\\\n2 x+9 &= -14 \\\\\n2 x &= -23 \\\\\nx &= -\\frac{23}{2}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n5. Finally, we can calculate the value of $x - y$:\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx - y &= -\\frac{23}{2}-(-3) \\\\\nx - y &= -\\frac{23}{2}+3 \\\\\nx - y &= -\\frac{23}{2}+\\frac{6}{2} \\\\\nx - y &= -\\frac{17}{2}\n\\endend$$\n\nSo, the final answer is $x - y = -\\frac{17}{2}$, which is **A: -8**.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
