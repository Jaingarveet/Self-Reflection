If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 15\n  C: 20\n  D: 22\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and the variable to be determined ($p$).\n2. Define variables: Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.\n3. Calculate the original area: The area of the rectangle is $LW$.\n4. Calculate the altered area: After changing the length and width, the new area is $(1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.\n5. Set up the equation: The altered area is [REDACTED]% less than the original area, so set up the equation $0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$.\n6. Simplify the equation: Simplify the equation to isolate $p$.\n7. Solve for $p$: Calculate the value of $p$ by isolating it in the equation.\n8. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches the calculated value of $p$.\n"

        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous attempt by incorrectly assuming that the decrease in width was proportional to the original width. I should have recognized that the decrease is calculated as a percentage of the original width.\n\nHere is the correct solution:\nLet $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle. The original area is $LW$.\n\nAfter altering the dimensions, the new length is $1.1L$, and the new width is $(1 - p/100)W$. So, the new area is $(1.1L)(1 - p/100)W$.\n\nSince these alterations decreased the area by 12 percent, we can set up the equation: $0.88LW = (1.1)(1 - p/100)LW$.\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n$0.88 = 1.1(1 - p/100)$\n$0.8 = 1 - p/100$\n$0.2 = p/100$\n$p = 20$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
