Let's use the points (1, -2) and (2, 1):\nslope = (1 - -2) / (2 - 1) = 3 / 1 = 3\n\nNow, we find the y-intercept by evaluating $f(0)$:\n$f(0) = -2$\n\nSo, the equation in slope-intercept form is:\n$y = 3x - 2$\n\nComparing with the options, we have:\nOption A: $f(n) = n - 3$, which is not a match.\nOption B: $f(n) = 2n - 4$, which is not a match.\nOption C: $f(n) = 3n - 5$, which is the correct equation.\nOption D: $f(n) = 4n - 6$, which is not a match.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n\nReflection: I incorrectly chose option B previously. I made a mistake in calculating the slope. I used the point (2, 4) instead of (2, 1), leading to an incorrect slope value. By reflecting on the solution, I realized the importance of accuracy in choosing the points for slope calculation and carefully substituting values to find the y-intercept. This will help me be more careful in future questions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
