I incorrectly assumed that the speed of sound would decrease by a constant value for each decrease in temperature. However, the relationship is not linear, and a smaller change in temperature is needed to reach the target speed.\n\nSolution:\n1. The formula given represents the relationship between the speed of sound and air temperature.\n2. We are looking for an approximate value, so we need to find the temperature at which the speed is closest to 1,000 ft/s, not exactly 1,000.\n3. Plugging in $a = 1,000$ ft/s and solving for $t$:\n$$\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n1,000 &= 1,052 + 1.08t \\\\\n52 &= 1.08t \\\\\nt &\\approx 48.15\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n$$\n4.
