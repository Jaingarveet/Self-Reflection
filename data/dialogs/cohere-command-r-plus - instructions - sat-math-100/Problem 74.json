So, I multiply the numerator and denominator of the resulting fraction by $\\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 5x + 6}$ to get a denominator of $x^2 + 5x + 6$, which matches choice A.\n\n$\\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 8x + 13} \\cdot \\frac{x^2 + 5x + 6}{x^2 + 5x + 6} = \\frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{(x^2 +5x +6)(x^2 + 8x + 13)} = \\frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{x^4 + 13x^2 + 6x^2 + 40x + 78}$.\n\nSimplifying the denominator of the resulting fraction:\n$\\frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{x^4 + 19x^2 + 40x + 78}$.\n\nFactoring the denominator:\n$\\frac{(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2}{(x^2 + 13)(x^2 + 6)}$.\n\nNow, I can see that the denominator matches the numerator of choice A.
