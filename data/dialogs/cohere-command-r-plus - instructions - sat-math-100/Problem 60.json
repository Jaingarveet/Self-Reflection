If he gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he will have 5 milliliters left over. In order to give each student 4 milliliters of solution, he will need an additional 21 milliliters. How many students are in the class?\nChoices:\n  A: 16\n  B: 21\n  C: 23\n  D: 26\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the problem: Mr. Kohl has a fixed amount of solution, and there are two scenarios with different distributions. \n2. Identify the variables: $n$ (amount of solution), $x$ (number of students). \n3. Write the equations: $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + [REDACTED]$. \n4. Solve for $n$ in the first equation: $n = 3x + 5$. \n5. Substitute and solve: Replace $n$ in the second equation and solve for $x$. \n6. Double-check: Plug $x$ back into both equations to ensure they are satisfied. \n7. Answer: Choose the option that matches the calculated value of $x$.\n"
