However, we must check these solutions in the original equation. For $x=2$, the left side of the original equation is $\\sqrt{8}$, while the right side is $-1$, so this doesn't work. For $x=-3/2$, we have $-\\sqrt{6} = -9/2$, which is true. Therefore, the answer is $x=-3/2$. Only choice II, 9, is correct.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
