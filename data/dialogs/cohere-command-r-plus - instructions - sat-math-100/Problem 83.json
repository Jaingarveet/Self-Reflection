A researcher for the company believes that employee job satisfaction varies greatly from store to store. Which of the following sampling methods is most appropriate to estimate the proportion of all employees of the company who are satisfied with their job?\nChoices:\n  A: Selecting one of the 50 stores at random and then surveying each employee at that store\n  B: Selecting 10 employees from each store at random and then surveying each employee selected\n  C: Surveying the 25 highest-paid employees and the 25 lowest-paid employees\n  D: Creating a website on which employees can express their opinions and then using the first 50 responses\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the goal: To estimate the proportion of satisfied employees across all 50 stores.\n2. Recognize the need for representation: Each store should be represented to ensure an unbiased estimate. \n3. Identify the method: Select a random sample of employees from each store. \n4. Justify the choice: This method ensures that every store has an equal chance of representation, providing a more accurate estimate. \n5. Avoid biased methods: \n   - Surveying a single store overlooks the potential variation across stores. \n   - Surveying only high/low-paid employees introduces a salary bias. \n   - Voluntary responses on a website may skew results toward very satisfied/dissatisfied employees.\n"

This minimizes bias and provides a more accurate estimate of job satisfaction across the company.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
