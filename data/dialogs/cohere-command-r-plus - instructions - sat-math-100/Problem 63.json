        "content": "Reflection: The equation representing the relationship between the given values is $300=60+30w$, where $60$ is the initial payment, $30$ is the weekly payment, and $w$ is the unknown number of weekly payments. Simplifying and rearranging this equation to solve for $w$ results in $300-60=30w \\implies w=8$. Therefore, the correct equation is $300=30w+60$.\n\nThought: \nThe total cost of the television ($$300$$) is the initial payment ($$60$$) plus the weekly payments ($$30$$) multiplied by the number of weeks ($$w$$). \nThis can be represented by the equation $300 = 60 + 30w$. \nTo isolate $w$, we can subtract $60$ from both sides, resulting in $300 - 60 = 30w$, and then divide by $30$ to get $w = 8$. \nSo, the equation that correctly represents this situation is $300 = 30w + 60$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
