The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.\n2. Consider all possible scenarios and conditions.\n3. Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.\n4. Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.\n5. Double-check your reasoning and answer choice before submitting.\n"
