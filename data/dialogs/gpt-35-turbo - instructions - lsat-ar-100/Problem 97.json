This means that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. Therefore, two different kinds of cookie have their first batch made on Monday and Wednesday. This means that two different kinds of cookie have their second batch made on Tuesday and Thursday. Two different kinds of cookie have their third batch made on Friday. Therefore, each of the following could be true except for two different kinds of cookie having their first batch made on Tuesday."
