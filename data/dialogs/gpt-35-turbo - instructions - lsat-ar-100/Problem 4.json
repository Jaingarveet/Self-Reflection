Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.\nQuestion: If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then which one of the following lab assistants must lead a Thursday session?\nChoices:\n  A: Rebecca\n  B: Olivia\n  C: Nessa\n  D: Kevin\n  E: Julio\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the constraints in the problem.\n2. Identify the possible scenarios based on the constraints.\n3. Analyze each scenario to determine which one satisfies all the constraints.\n4. Choose the answer that matches the scenario that satisfies all the constraints.\n"
