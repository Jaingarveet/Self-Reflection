Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.\n- If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the third batch of any kind of cookie is made on Friday. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.\n- Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.\n- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. This violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.\n- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. This satisfies all the given conditions.\nAnswer:\nTherefore, the statement that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday."
