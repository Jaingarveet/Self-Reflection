Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions.\n2. Consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.\n3. Make a list of all the students who must give reports and on which days.\n4. Consider the different possibilities for when George can give his report.\n5. Consider the different possibilities for when Nina can give her report.\n6. Determine which students must give reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n7. Determine which students must give morning reports and which must give afternoon reports.\n8. Use the process of elimination to determine which answer choice must be true.\n"
