I also made a mistake in my algebraic manipulations.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I carefully read the problem and decomposed it into multiple simple steps. I then thought through each subproblem step-by-step, being explicit in each step of my reasoning. I double-checked my calculations and final answer, and made sure to set up the correct equation to represent the problem. I was careful with my algebraic manipulations and simplifications, and checked my answer against the given choices."
