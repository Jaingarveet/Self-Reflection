I also did not double-check my calculations and final answer.\nTo avoid making the same mistake again, I carefully read the question and decomposed the problem into multiple simple steps. I explicitly thought through each subproblem step-by-step and double-checked my calculations and final answer. I also remembered that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."
