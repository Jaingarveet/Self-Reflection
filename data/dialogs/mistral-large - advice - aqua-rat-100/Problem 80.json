        "content": "Thought:\nLet's denote the number of white sharpeners as \"w\" and the number of brown sharpeners as \"b\".\nWe know that Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners, so we can write the equation: w + b = 18.\nWe also know that Jack paid Rs. 100 for all the sharpeners, and that he paid Rs. 1 more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. Let's denote the cost of a brown sharpener as \"x\". Then the cost of a white sharpener is \"x + 1\". We can write another equation based on this information: x \\* b + (x + 1) \\* w = 100.\nNow we have two equations and two variables. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \"w\" and \"b\".\nFirst, let's isolate \"w\" in the first equation: w = 18 - b.\nNow we can substitute this expression for \"w\" into the second equation: x \\* b + (x + 1) \\* (18 - b) = 100.\nSimplifying this equation, we get: x \\* b + 18x + 18 - x \\* b - b = 100.\nCombining like terms, we get: 18x - b = 82.\nNow we have two equations: w = 18 - b and 18x - b = 82.\nWe can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: 18x - (18 - w) = 82.\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 18x - 18 + w = 82.\nRearranging the terms, we get: w = 82 - 18x + 18.\nSubstituting the value of \"w\" from the first equation, we get: 18 - b = 82 - 18x + 18.\nSimplifying this equation, we get: 18x - b = 62.\nNow we have two equations: 18x - b = 82 and 18x - b = 62.\nThese equations are contradictory, which means there is an error in the problem statement or our interpretation of it.\nHowever, since we must select one of the available choices, we can try to find a solution that satisfies one of the equations.\nIf we use the equation 18x - b = 62, we can solve for \"b\": b = 18x - 62.\nSubstituting this expression for \"b\" into the first equation, we get: w = 18 - (18x - 62).\nSimplifying this equation, we get: w = 80 - 18x.\nNow we can try different values of \"x\" to find integer values of \"w\" and \"b\" that satisfy both equations.\nIf we try x = 3, we get w = 80 - 18 \\* 3 = 80 - 54 = 26 and b = 18 \\* 3 - 62 = 54 - 62 = -8.\nThese values do not make sense in the context of the problem, since the number of brown sharpeners cannot be negative.\nIf we try x = 4, we get w = 80 - 18 \\* 4 = 80 - 72 = 8 and b = 18 \\* 4 - 62 = 72 - 62 = 10.\nThese values satisfy both equations and make sense in the context of the problem.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
