To find the other integer, I need to find a factor of 7700 that is also divisible by 11.\n\nStep 1: Find the prime factors of 7700.\n7700 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7^2 * 11\n\nStep 2: Find the factors of 7700 that are also divisible by 11.\nThe factors of 7700 that are also divisible by 11 are 11, 22, 35, 55, 77, 110, 140, 175, 220, 275, 350, 440, 525, 700, 770, 1100, 1400, 1750, 2200, 2750, 3500, 4400, 5250, 7000, and 7700.\n\nStep 3: Find the factor that is also divisible by 350.\nThe factor that is also divisible by 350 is 700.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not read the question carefully and did not understand the problem. I also did not decompose the problem into multiple simple steps and did not think through each subproblem step-by-step. I also skipped some steps in my reasoning and did not double-check my calculations and final answer. To avoid making the same mistake again, I will always read the question carefully and understand the problem. I will also decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps and think through each subproblem step-by-step. I will never skip any steps in my reasoning and will always double-check my calculations and final answer. I will also remember that the GCF and LCM of two integers are related but not the same and that the other integer must be a factor of the LCM and must also be divisible by the prime factors of the GCF."
