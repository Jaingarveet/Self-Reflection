However, since the LCM is not always applicable in problems involving percentages, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem.\n\nThe problem states that there are more than 501 students in the school. Let's start by checking the first answer choice, 550.\n\nIf there are 550 students in the school, then 20% of them took physics, which is equal to 0.20 x 550 = 110 students. Similarly, 28% of them took math, which is equal to 0.28 x 550 = 154 students.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that exactly 20% of them took physics and exactly 28% of them took math, we need to find a number of students that is divisible by both 20 and 28.\n\nThe least common multiple of 20 and 28 is 140. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 140 x 5 = 700.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
