        "content": "Thought:\nTo minimize the number of letters needed, Amy should first use all single letters before moving on to pairs.\nSince the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can use combinations to calculate the number of unique pairs that can be formed.\nThe formula for combinations is nCk = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.\n\nLet's start with one letter codes:\n1C1 = 1! / [1!(1-1)!] = 1\n\nSo, we can create 1 unique code with 1 letter.\n\nNow, let's move on to two-letter codes (pairs):\n2C2 = 2! / [2!(2-2)!] = 1\n\nWe can create 1 unique pair with 2 letters. However, since we have already used 1 letter for a single-letter code, we need to add another letter to create more pairs.\n\nWith 3 letters, we can create the following pairs: AB, AC (BC is not needed since the order does not matter):\n3C2 = 3! / [2!(3-2)!] = 3\n\nSo, we can create 3 unique pairs with 3 letters. Including the single-letter codes, we now have a total of 4 unique codes (1 single-letter code + 3 pairs).\n\nTo reach 10 unique codes, we need to add one more letter:\n4C2 = 4! / [2!(4-2)!] = 6\n\nWith 4 letters, we can create 6 unique pairs. Including the single-letter codes, we now have a total of 10 unique codes (1 single-letter code + 3 pairs from 3 letters + 6 pairs from 4 letters).\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I might have overlooked the fact that the order of letters in a pair does not matter, which would have led me to calculate permutations instead of combinations. By carefully considering the problem and using the correct formula for combinations, I arrived at the correct answer."
