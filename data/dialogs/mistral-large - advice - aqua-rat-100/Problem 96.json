        "content": "Thought:\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how much profit each person made per month and then use that information to determine how long C was in the business.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much profit A and B made together before C joined. Since C made Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, A and B together made Rs.225,000 (Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000).\n\nNext, let's find out how many months A and B were in the business together before C joined. Let's assume that C joined x months after B joined. Then A was in the business for 12 months, B was in the business for 12 - x months, and C was in the business for x months.\n\nSince A invested Rs.40,000 and B invested Rs.60,000, their combined investment was Rs.100,000. Therefore, their combined profit per month was Rs.225,000 / (12 - x) (since they were in the business together for 12 - x months).\n\nSimilarly, since C invested Rs.120,000, his profit per month was Rs.150,000 / x.\n\nNow, we can set up an equation to solve for x:\n\nRs.225,000 / (12 - x) = Rs.150,000 / x\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\n225x = 150(12 - x)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n225x = 1800 - 150x\n\nAdding 150x to both sides, we get:\n\n375x = 1800\n\nDividing both sides by 375, we get:\n\nx = 4.8\n\nSince we're looking for a whole number of months, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 5 months.\n\nTherefore, C joined the business 5 months after B joined.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
