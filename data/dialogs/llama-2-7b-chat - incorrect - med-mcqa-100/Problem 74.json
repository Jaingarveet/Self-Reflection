This nerve is located in the skull base and is at risk of injury during the surgical procedure. The Vagus nerve is responsible for controlling various functions, including voice, swallowing, and breathing. If the Vagus nerve is injured during surgery, it can result in symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, and respiratory difficulties.\n\nAction: I will select option A, Vagus nerve, as the most likely nerve injured during lateral skull base surgery."
