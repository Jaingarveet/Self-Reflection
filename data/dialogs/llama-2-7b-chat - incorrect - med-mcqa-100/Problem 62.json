Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the question and selected the wrong answer. I should have paid closer attention to the wording of the question and the anatomy of the uterine tube.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the infundibulum. The infundibulum is the narrowest part of the uterine tube, located where it attaches to the uterus. It is the site where the fertilized egg implants during pregnancy.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
