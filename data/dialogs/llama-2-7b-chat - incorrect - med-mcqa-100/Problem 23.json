However, upon further reflection, I realized that this answer is incorrect.\n\nExpanisle type osseous metastases are actually characteristic of primary malignancy of the prostate. This is because the prostate gland is located near the bones of the spine and pelvis, and metastases from prostate cancer can spread to these bones, causing expansile type osseous metastases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Prostate.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
