Upon reviewing the options, I realized that Timolol is actually a beta-blocker that reduces aqueous production, not the outflow.\n\nThe correct answer is option B, Pilocarpine, which increases aqueous outflow by relaxing the trabecular meshwork.\n\nAction: I will select the correct answer, option B, Pilocarpine.\n\nAnswer: B) Pilocarpine"
