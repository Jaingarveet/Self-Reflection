The elevated AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) and hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels are consistent with RCC. The location of the mass at the left renal hilum is also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nThe most likely diagnosis is metastatic germ cell tumor. While RCC is also a possibility, the patient's age and the location of the mass at the left renal hilum are more consistent with a germ cell tumor. Additionally, the elevated AFP and hCG levels are more consistent with a germ cell tumor than RCC."
