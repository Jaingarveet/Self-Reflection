Drug to treat such a case is:\nChoices:\n  A: Topical antibiotic\n  B: Benzoyl peroxide\n  C: Retinoids\n  D: Estrogen\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realize now that I overlooked an important factor in my initial response. I mistakenly selected topical antibiotics as the best answer, but upon further reflection, I understand that benzoyl peroxide is the most appropriate treatment for comedonal acne in this scenario.\n\nBenzoyl peroxide is an effective treatment for comedonal acne, which is characterized by the presence of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads). It works by reducing the amount of sebum produced by the skin, which can help to prevent comedones from forming. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide has antibacterial properties, which can help to reduce inflammation and prevent infection.\n\nIn contrast, topical antibiotics are typically used to treat bacterial infections, such as folliculitis, which is an inflammation of the hair follicles. While they may be effective in treating some types of acne, they are not the best choice for comedonal acne.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Benzoyl peroxide."
