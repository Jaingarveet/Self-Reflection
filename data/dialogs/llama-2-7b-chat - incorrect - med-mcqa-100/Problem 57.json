However, upon further review, I realize that the correct answer is option D, \"Quaternary structure.\" This is because denaturation does not affect the quaternary structure of a protein, which refers to the arrangement of its subunits (substructures) in the native state.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids, the secondary structure refers to the local arrangements of amino acids (e.g., alpha helices and beta sheets), and the tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me to better understand the concept and to provide the correct answer this time.\n\nAnswer: D) Quaternary structure"
