The VSD is visible as a large opacity in the mediastinum, with a distinct border separating the two ventricles. The size of the VSD and the degree of heart failure are consistent with a VSD in this age group. The other options (TOF, TAPVC, and TGA) are less likely given the findings on the chest X-ray."
