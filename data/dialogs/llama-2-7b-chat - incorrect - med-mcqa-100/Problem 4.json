However, upon reviewing the information, I realized that the correct answer is (A) 100 mg iron + 500 mcg folic acid.\n\nTo arrive at this answer, I consulted the recommended daily dosage of iron and folic acid for pregnant women. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), pregnant women should take 100 mg of iron and 500 mcg of folic acid daily to prevent anemia and birth defects. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\n[REDACTED]"
