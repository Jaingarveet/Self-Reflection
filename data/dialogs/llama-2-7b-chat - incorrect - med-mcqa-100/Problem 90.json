Oligohydramnios is a condition where there is a decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus, which can cause an unstable lie. This is a common complication in pregnancies where the mother has a history of previous normal deliveries, as the placenta may not be functioning properly.\n\nAction: I will answer the question with (A) Oligohydramnios."
