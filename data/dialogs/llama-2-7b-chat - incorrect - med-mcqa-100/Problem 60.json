The correct answer is (D) Cluster random sampling. In this type of sampling, every 10th person is selected from a cluster, such as a neighborhood or a community, rather than from a random sample of the entire population. This method allows for more accurate representation of the population, as the clusters are likely to be more homogeneous than a random sample of the entire population.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
