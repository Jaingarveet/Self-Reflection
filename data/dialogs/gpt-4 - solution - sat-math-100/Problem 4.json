Which of the following could be the value of $k$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: 0\n  B: 4\n  C: 8\n  D: 16\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If the line passes through the origin, then the y-intercept must be zero. This means that when x=[REDACTED], y must also be [REDACTED]. \nWe can set up the equation of the line using the slope and one of the points, (2, k), and then set y=[REDACTED] and solve for x:\n[REDACTED] = [(32-k)/(k-2)]*([REDACTED]-2) + k\n[REDACTED] = -2*(32-k)/(k-2) + k\n[REDACTED] = -6[REDACTED] + 2k + k(k-2)\n[REDACTED] = k^2 - 66k + 6[REDACTED]\nSolving this quadratic equation for k, we find that k = 2 or k = 32. However, k cannot be 2 because the denominator of the slope would be zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the only possible value for k is 32.\n"
