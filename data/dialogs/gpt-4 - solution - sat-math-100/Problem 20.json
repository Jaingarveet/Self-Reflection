What is the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point $(x, y)$ of the system?\nChoices:\n  A: -0.5\n  B: -0.25\n  C: 0.8\n  D: 1.75\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nTo solve the system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 0.5 and the second equation by 1.5 to make the coefficients of y the same:\n1.2x - 0.75y = 0.15\n2.4x + 0.75y = -1.95\nAdding these two equations together, we get:\n3.6x = -1.8\nSolving for x, we find:\nx = -1.8 / 3.6 = [REDACTED]\n"
