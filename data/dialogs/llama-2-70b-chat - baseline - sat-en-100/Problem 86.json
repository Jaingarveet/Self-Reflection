        "content": "Topic: English\nContext: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.\"If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry.\"My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \\& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \\mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 \"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,\" I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.\"A friend of yours?\"\"A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too.\" That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.\nQuestion: Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a\nChoices:\n  A: general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident.\n  B: depiction of the narrator's father to an examination of an author with whom the narrator becomes enchanted.\n  C: symbolic representation of a skill the narrator possesses to an example of its application.\n  D: tale about the hardships of the narrator's childhood to an analysis of the effects of those hardships.\n"

        "content": "  Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nThe passage begins by discussing the narrator's love of reading and how it served as a refuge from their troubled home life. It then shifts to a specific incident where the narrator's father discovers their reading habit and tears a book from their hands, throwing it out the window. Following this, the narrator describes their favorite bookshop and how the bookseller there allows them to read books for free and even gifts them a volume of Charles Dickens' \"Great Expectations.\" The passage culminates in the narrator expressing their desire to learn to write like Dickens.\n\nTherefore, the main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading (option A) to a portrayal of an influential incident where the narrator receives a meaningful gift from the bookseller (option A)."
