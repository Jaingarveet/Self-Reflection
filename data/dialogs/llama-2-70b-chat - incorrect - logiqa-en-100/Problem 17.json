The correct answer is choice B: After the introduction of aluminum alloy armored vehicles, the army must retain maintenance personnel and purchase new tools and parts.\n\nThe reason for this is that the cost of maintaining and repairing aluminum alloy armored vehicles may be higher than that of steel armored vehicles, which could offset the initial cost difference. Additionally, the need for new tools and parts may also increase the overall cost of using aluminum alloy armored vehicles.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
