However, I can provide a solution to the problem.\n\nThe given statement implies that there is an inverse relationship between cost and profit. If the cost is high, the profit is low, and if the profit is high, the cost is low.\n\nNow, let's consider each choice:\n\nA: Employees hold shares in the enterprise, and there is a conflict of interest with the boss.\nThis choice is not related to the given statement. Even if employees hold shares in the enterprise, it does not necessarily mean that there is a conflict of interest with the boss.\n\nB: If the employee holds shares in the enterprise, there is no conflict in the interests of the boss and the employee.\nThis choice is also not related to the given statement. Holding shares in the enterprise does not necessarily mean that the interests of the boss and the employee are aligned.\n\nC: If the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest.\nThis choice is related to the given statement. If the cost is high (i.e., the employee's wage is high), then the profit is low. In this case, the boss and the employee may have conflicts of interest because the boss wants to minimize costs, while the employee wants to maximize their wage.\n\nD: The boss always makes more money than the employees.\nThis choice is not necessarily true. The given statement only implies that there is an inverse relationship between cost and profit, not that the boss always makes more money than the employees.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: If the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest."
