Let's analyze the choices again:\n\nA: \"Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles.\" Throughout the ages\nThis saying suggests that good things are less likely to be spread as widely as bad things. Even if the number of posts about positive topics has increased, it may not be enough to offset the increase in negative posts. Therefore, this choice does not weaken the argument.\n\nB: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years\nThis choice provides context for the increase in posts about social issues. If the number of Internet users has quadrupled, it's possible that the absolute number of posts about positive topics has also increased, even if the proportion of positive posts has decreased. However, this choice does not directly weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nC: In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes.\nThis choice suggests that some people are using the internet for malicious purposes, which could contribute to the increase in negative posts. However, it does not directly address the comparison between the past year and 5 years ago.\n\nD: The online forum is a legal forum\nThis choice does not provide any information that would weaken the argument.\n\nReflecting on my previous mistake, I realize that I overlooked the fact that the argument relies on a comparison between two time periods. Choice B provides context for this comparison and weakens the argument by suggesting that the increase in negative posts may be due to an increase in the number of Internet users, rather than a deterioration of the social atmosphere.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
