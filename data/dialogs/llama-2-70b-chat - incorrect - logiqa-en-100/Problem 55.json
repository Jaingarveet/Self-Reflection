Condition (4) states that neither P nor K can be in the same team as N. Condition (6) states that if H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nFrom the given choices, we can see that choice A violates condition (6) since H is in team 2, but Q is not in the middle of team 1.\nChoice B violates condition (4) since P and N are in the same team.\nChoice C violates condition (1) since G is not in front.\nChoice D violates condition (5) since P and Q are in the same team.\nTherefore, the correct answer is none of the above.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the above\")"
