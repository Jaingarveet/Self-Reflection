Since there is no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on the given information.\nThought:\nThe selection conditions can be translated into the following logic statements:\n1. (E or F) and not (E and F) (one of E or F participates, but not both)\n2. J or K participates (one of J or K will participate, but not both)\n3. If J participates, then G participates (J implies G)\n4. If F does not participate, then M does not participate (not F implies not M)\n\nWe can create a truth table to determine the possible combinations of players that satisfy all the conditions:\n\n| E | F | G | H | J | K | M |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that only one combination satisfies all the conditions: E=F=0, G=H=1, J=K=1, M=0.\nTherefore, the coach will select players G and H.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
