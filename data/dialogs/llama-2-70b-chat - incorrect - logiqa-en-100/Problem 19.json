Since there's no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on my understanding of the topic.\n\nThe correct answer is A: Although some people agree with his views, they do not agree with his analysis.\n\nThe blogger's conclusion that \"Most people agree with me\" is based on the number of follow-up posts that agree with his opinion. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people agree with his analysis. Some people may agree with his views but not with his reasoning or methodology. Therefore, option A is the best choice to question the blogger's conclusion.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the other options:\n\nB: The blogger's other articles with higher approval ratings later proved to be wrong.\nThis option does not directly question the blogger's conclusion about the number of follow-up posts agreeing with his opinion. It only suggests that the blogger's previous articles may have been incorrect, which does not necessarily imply that the current article is incorrect.\n\nC: Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified.\nThis option implies that some of the objections to the post are more reasonable or well-supported. However, it does not directly question the blogger's conclusion about the number of follow-up posts agreeing with his opinion.\n\nD: Most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans.\nThis option suggests that the blogger's followers may be biased towards agreeing with his opinions. However, it does not directly question the blogger's conclusion about the number of follow-up posts agreeing with his opinion.\n\nTherefore, option A is the best choice to question the blogger's conclusion."
