If you don't want to do something, then you shouldn't do it to others.\n\nB: If you want, then give it to others.\nThis option is also a logical inference from the sentence. If you want to do something, then it's okay to do it to others.\n\nC: Don't treat others unless you want to.\nThis option is a logical inference from the sentence. If you don't want to do something to others, then don't do it.\n\nD: Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.\nThis option is not a logical inference from the sentence. The sentence only states that you shouldn't do something to others that you don't want to do yourself, it doesn't say anything about what people want.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
