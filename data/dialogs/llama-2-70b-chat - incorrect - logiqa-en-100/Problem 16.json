The hypothesis discussed by the economist is actually choice D: Polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries than in developed countries.\n\nThe economist's argument is based on the idea that developed countries can benefit from transferring polluting industries to developing countries, where the cost of environmental damage is lower. This allows developed countries to improve their natural environment while still benefiting from the economic activity generated by these industries. Developing countries, on the other hand, benefit from the employment and tax revenue generated by these industries, which helps to compensate for the environmental damage caused.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: Polluting industries can generate more profits in developing countries than in developed countries.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
