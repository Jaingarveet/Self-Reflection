The correct answer is the one that challenges the claim that hundreds of people lived in the cave.\n\nHere's a revised version of the question with the answer you chose:\n\nTopic: Logic\nContext: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology\n  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue\n  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave\n  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago\n\nAnswer: \"D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago\"\n\nThe correct answer is D. The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago. This answer refutes the argument that hundreds of people lived in the cave because if the entrance had collapsed 5000 years ago, it would have been impossible for people to enter and live in the cave during that time.\n\nThe other options do not refute the argument. Option A, the cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology, does not provide any evidence that the cave was not inhabited by hundreds of people. Option B, the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, does not necessarily contradict the idea that hundreds of people lived in the cave, as it is possible that the cave was used for both purposes. Option C, there is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave, does not provide any information about the inhabitability of the cave."
