Chess Armor and C will play tomorrow.\n\nFrom the information above, we can infer that:\n\n* Chessman A is stronger than Chessman B.\n* Chessman B is weaker than Chessman A and Chessman C.\n* Chess Armor and Chessman C are of equal strength.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible outcomes of the match between Chess Armor and Chessman C:\n\n1. Chess Armor wins.\n2. Chessman C wins.\n3. The two are tied.\n\nBased on the information above, we can eliminate option 1, as Chess Armor and Chessman C are of equal strength. Therefore, the probability of Chess Armor winning is 50%.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nD: Chess armor is likely to win, but it is also possible to lose.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. If not, I'll reflect on my mistake and provide a better solution."
