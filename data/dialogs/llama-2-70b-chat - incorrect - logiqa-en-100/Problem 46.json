However, I can provide a logical solution to the problem.\nThe conditions given are:\n1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.\n2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nFrom condition 1, we know that H and Y must be in the same department. From condition 2, we know that F and G cannot be in the same department. From condition 3, we know that if X is in the sales department, W is in the production department. From condition 4, we know that F must be in the production department.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA: G and I\nWe know that F and G cannot be in the same department, so G cannot be in the sales department. Therefore, this option is unlikely.\n\nB: G and X\nWe know that if X is in the sales department, W is in the production department. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\nC: G and Y\nWe know that H and Y must be in the same department, and G cannot be in the same department as F. Therefore, this option is unlikely.\n\nD: H and W\nWe know that W must be in the production department if X is in the sales department. Therefore, this option is possible.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the answer is B: G and X.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
