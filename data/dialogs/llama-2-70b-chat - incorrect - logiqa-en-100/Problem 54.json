Since there's no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on my understanding of the context.\nThe correct answer is choice A: \"The change of the problem means that the transition from the competition of the enterprise to the competition of the industry.\"\n\nWhen a country joins the WTO, its enterprises are no longer competing solely within their local market. They are now part of a global market, competing with companies from other countries. Therefore, the focus shifts from being the best within a specific country to being the best within the industry worldwide.\n\nThis explanation aligns with the given context, which states that the question has changed from \"What should I do, what can I do to make money?\" to \"What can I do to be the best?\" after joining the WTO.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
