Since there is no reflection information provided, I'll answer the question based on the given information.\n\nLet's analyze the given information:\n\n1. There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.\n2. F and G are not in charge of the same department.\n3. H and I are not in charge of the same department.\n\nWe know that F and M are not in charge of the same department. From condition 1, we know that one assistant general manager is in charge of three departments. Let's assume that assistant is F. Then, F cannot be in charge of the same department as G, H, or I (conditions 2 and 3).\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination is:\nF - Departments A, B, C\nG - Departments D, E, F\nH - Departments G, H, I\nI - Departments I, J, K\nM - Departments A, B, C\nP - Departments D, E, F\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA - F and H are in charge of the same department: False. F is in charge of departments A, B, and C, while H is in charge of departments G, H, and I.\n\nB - F and I are in charge of the same department: False. F is in charge of departments A, B, and C, while I is in charge of departments I, J, and K.\n\nC - I and P are in charge of the same department: False. I is in charge of departments I, J, and K, while P is in charge of departments D, E, and F.\n\nD - M and G are in charge of the same department: True. M and G are both in charge of department A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D - M and G are in charge of the same department."
