However, I can give you a solution to this question.\n\nLet's consider the given conditions:\n\n1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.\n2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nIf X and F are assigned to the same department, then we can deduce the following:\n\n* If X and F are in the production department, then condition 3 implies that W must be in the production department too, which violates condition 4.\n* If X and F are in the sales department, then condition 1 implies that H and Y must be in the same department, which means they cannot be in the sales department. Therefore, H and Y must be in the production department, which violates condition 4.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that X and F cannot be assigned to the same department.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: G is assigned to the sales department.\nThis statement is compatible with the conditions given, so it cannot be true.\n\nB: H is assigned to the production department.\nThis statement violates condition 1, so it cannot be true.\n\nC: I was assigned to the sales department.\nThis statement is compatible with the conditions given, so it cannot be true.\n\nD: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nThis statement violates condition 3, so it cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: G is assigned to the sales department."
