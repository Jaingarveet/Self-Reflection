However, I can offer a solution using logical reasoning.\n\nThe inconsistency in the survey's findings and the experts' beliefs can be eliminated by considering the following factors:\n\n1. The survey may not have accounted for other factors that contribute to traffic accidents, such as speeding, reckless driving, or road conditions. Strict investigation of drunk driving may not necessarily address these other factors.\n2. The survey may not have considered the effectiveness of the strict investigation of drunk driving in reducing accidents. Even if drunk driving is being strictly investigated, it's possible that the enforcement is not effective in deterring drunk drivers.\n3. The survey may not have accounted for the possibility that drunk drivers are not always caught. Strict investigation may not necessarily lead to a complete elimination of drunk driving.\n\nBased on the above factors, the best answer to eliminate the inconsistency is:\n\nB: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.\n\nThis answer acknowledges that strict investigation of drunk driving may not be enough to completely eliminate drunk driving, which could explain why the survey found similar incidence of traffic accidents in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those where it is not."
