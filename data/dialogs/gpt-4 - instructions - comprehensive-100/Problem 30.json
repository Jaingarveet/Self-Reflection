At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.\n2. Determine the placement of each book based on these conditions.\n3. Remember that each shelf must have at least two books.\n4. Consider the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n5. Consider the conditions for each book's placement relative to other books.\n6. Double-check each condition to ensure you have not overlooked any.\n7. Choose the answer that matches your determined arrangement.\n"

Since F is on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the top shelf (as it would violate the first condition), so they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. \nSince O must be on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top or middle shelf. \nSince I is on the middle shelf, and we know that F and M are also on the middle shelf (from the condition that F and M are on the same shelf), the only option that includes all three (F, I, M) is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
