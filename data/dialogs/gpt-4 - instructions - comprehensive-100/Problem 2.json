The total width of the pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.\n3. The total space between the pickets is (x - 1) * 6 inches because there is no space after the last picket.\n4. The total length in inches is x/2 + (x - 1) * 6 = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6.\n5. Convert the total length in inches to feet by dividing by 12: (6.5x - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2.\n6.
