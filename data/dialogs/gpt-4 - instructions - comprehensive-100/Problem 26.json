Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the shoe store is in space 2, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 5.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 1.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 3.\n  D: The toy store is in space 6.\n  E: The veterinarian is in space 4.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the constraints of the problem.\n2. Identify the fixed positions (in this case, the shoe store in space 2).\n3. Apply the constraints to the fixed positions.\n4. Eliminate options that do not meet the constraints.\n5. Choose the answer that fits all the constraints.\n"

This could be possible, but we need to check other options.\nB: The pharmacy is in space 1. This is possible because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and it can be next to the shoe store which is in space 2.\nC: A restaurant is in space 3. This is not possible because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses and we already know that one restaurant is at one end of the row.\nD: The toy store is in space 6. This could be possible, but we need to check other options.\nE: The veterinarian is in space 4. This could be possible, but we need to check other options.\nAfter analyzing all the options, option B: The pharmacy is in space 1 seems to be the only one that fits all the constraints.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
