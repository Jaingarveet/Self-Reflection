So, the slope is (32 - k) / (k - 2).\nSince the line passes through the origin, the slope should also be k/2 (as the line is in the form y = mx, and here m = k/2).\nSo, we set up the equation (32 - k) / (k - 2) = k / 2 and solve for k.\nAction: \nFirst, cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions: 2*(32 - k) = k*(k - 2).\nThis simplifies to 64 - 2k = k^2 - 2k.\nRearranging terms gives k^2 - 64 = 0.\nFactoring the left side gives (k - 8)(k + 8) = 0.\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives k = 8 or k = -8.\nSince k cannot be negative in this context, the only possible value for k is 8.\nAnswer: Answer(\"C\")"
