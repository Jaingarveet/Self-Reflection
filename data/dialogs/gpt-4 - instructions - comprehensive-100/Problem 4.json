So, Speed = Distance/Time = 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s.\n2. Multiply the maximum speed by the time it takes for the shuttle to pass a point to find the length of the shuttle. So, Length = Speed * Time = 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m.\n3. Round your answer to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, 87.5 m is not an option.\n4.
