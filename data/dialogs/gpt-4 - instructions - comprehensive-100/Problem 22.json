Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the question.\n2. Identify the constraints for each student.\n3. Determine the possible days each student can give a report.\n4. Consider the conditions for each choice.\n5. Choose the answer that fits all conditions.\n"

This means that Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday. However, since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, Robert must give his report on Monday morning and Nina must give hers on Wednesday morning. This means that Helen and Irving cannot both give reports on Thursday, as Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
