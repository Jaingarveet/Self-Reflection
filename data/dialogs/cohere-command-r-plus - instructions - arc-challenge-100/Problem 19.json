Evaluate each option based on the recycling properties of the materials:\n   - Steel cans are recyclable but often undergo a different process and are not commonly reused multiple times.\n   - Glass bottles can be recycled and reused indefinitely without significant quality degradation.\n   - Paper containers degrade with each recycling cycle and are not suitable for reuse many times.\n   - Plastic containers undergo similar issues as paper; they degrade and are not suitable for indefinite reuse.\n3. Select the answer that best meets the criteria: Glass bottles (Choice B).\n"
