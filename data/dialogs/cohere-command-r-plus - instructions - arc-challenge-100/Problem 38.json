Which of the following has the lowest mass?\nChoices:\n  A: 2 m^3 of bricks\n  B: 4 m^3 of bricks\n  C: 6000 m^3 of air\n  D: 10,000 m^3 of air\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the relationship between density and mass: Density = Mass / Volume, so Mass = Density x Volume. \n2. Recognize that the question asks for the lowest mass, which will be determined by the material with the lowest density, regardless of volume. \n3. Identify the densities: bricks have a density of 2000 kg/m^3, and air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. \n4. Choose the option with the lowest volume of bricks, as this will result in the lowest mass.\n"
