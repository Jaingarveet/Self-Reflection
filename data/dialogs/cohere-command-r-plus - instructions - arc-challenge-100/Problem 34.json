After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?\nChoices:\n  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.\n  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.\n  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.\n  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Focus on the phrase \"strengthen their conclusions.\"\n2. Interpret \"limited testing\" as a need for validation and reproducibility.\n3. Recognize that engaging an independent lab addresses these concerns.\n4. Understand that reproducibility is a key aspect of scientific research.\n5. Interpret \"human volunteers\" as an unnecessary expansion at this stage.\n"
