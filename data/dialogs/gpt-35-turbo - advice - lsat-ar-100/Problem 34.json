The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question stem carefully and understand what is being asked.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and conditions before answering.\n - Eliminate answer choices that are not necessarily true.\n - Determine which answer choice must be true based on the given conditions.\n - Double-check your reasoning and answer choice before submitting.\n"
