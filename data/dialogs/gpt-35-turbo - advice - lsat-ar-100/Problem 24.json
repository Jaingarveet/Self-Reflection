The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?\nChoices:\n  A: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.\n  B: If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\n  C: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\n  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.\n - Always think through the logical implications of each constraint.\n - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the question.\n - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n - Remember that the correct answer is the one that has the same effect as the original constraint.\n"
