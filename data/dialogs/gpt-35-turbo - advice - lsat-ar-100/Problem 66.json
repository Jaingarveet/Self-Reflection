However, we don't know the order of Q, R, and S, so we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. This choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.\nB: H is sixth.\nIf H is sixth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles (Q, R, S) and the fourth article must be Y. Since S must be earlier than Y, S must be fourth and Q and R must be fifth and sixth (in some order). Then, the finance articles (G, H, J) must be edited last, in the order J, G, H. This choice fully determines the order of the articles.\nC: R is fourth.\nIf R is fourth, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles (Q, S, [REDACTED]). We cannot determine the fourth article, so we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. This choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.\nD: R is seventh.\nIf R is seventh, then the first three articles must be nutrition articles (Q, S, [REDACTED]). We cannot determine the order of the remaining articles, so this choice does not fully determine the order of the articles.\nE: Y is fifth.\nIf Y is fifth, then the fourth article must be S (since S must be earlier than Y).
