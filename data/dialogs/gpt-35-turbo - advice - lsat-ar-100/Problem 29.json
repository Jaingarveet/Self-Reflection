At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.\n - Always analyze each option and eliminate those that are impossible or unlikely.\n - Always choose the option that must be true based on the given conditions and constraints.\n - Never make assumptions without considering all possibilities.\n - Never limit your scenario analysis to a single outcome.\n"

Therefore, O must be on the bottom shelf since it is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means that K is also on the bottom shelf since it is placed on a higher shelf than F. Since I is on the middle shelf, G and H must be on the top shelf. This leaves F and M to be on the same shelf, which must be the middle shelf. Therefore, A, B, D, and E are all false. The only option that must be true is that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
