The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: J is second.\n  B: J is third\n  C: Q is first.\n  D: Q is third\n  E: R is seventh.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the given conditions and constraints.\n - Always consider all possible cases and orderings.\n - Always apply the given conditions and constraints to eliminate impossible cases.\n - Always deduce the possible cases that satisfy all the conditions and constraints.\n - Always check each possible case to determine which statements must be true.\n - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving problems in law.\n"
