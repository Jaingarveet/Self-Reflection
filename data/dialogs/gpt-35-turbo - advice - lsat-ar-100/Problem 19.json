Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.\n - Make a list of all the students who must give reports and on which days.\n - Consider the different possibilities for each student who must give a report.\n - Use the process of elimination to determine which answer choice must be true.\n - Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.\n"

Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, or else Helen and Irving would have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible since there are already two people giving reports on Wednesday.\nThus, Nina must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.

Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.\nIf Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day. Therefore, Irving can give a report on Monday or Wednesday.\nThus, Irving can give a report on Monday or Wednesday, but we cannot determine which one for sure. However, we do know that Kyle must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday, since there are already two people giving reports on Monday. Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Wednesday.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
