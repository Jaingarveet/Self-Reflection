        "content": "Action: Answer(\"A\") \n**Explanation:**\nThe barium enema shows a microcolon, which is a characteristic finding in congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease). The intestinal biopsy confirms the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, which is diagnostic of this condition.\n**Key points:**\n* Congenital aganglionic megacolon is a birth defect that affects the large intestine.\n* It is caused by the absence of ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, which are responsible for controlling the movement of stool through the intestines.\n* This results in a functional obstruction of the colon, leading to symptoms such as delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting.\n* The diagnosis is confirmed by barium enema and intestinal biopsy.\n**Differential diagnosis:**\n* Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: This condition causes a narrowing of the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and the small intestine. It can present with similar symptoms to congenital aganglionic megacolon, but the barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would be different.\n* Cystic fibrosis: This is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It can cause meconium ileus, a blockage of the small intestine with thick, sticky meconium. However, the barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would not be consistent with congenital aganglionic megacolon.\n* Intestinal malrotation: This is a birth defect that occurs when the intestines do not rotate properly during fetal development. It can cause intestinal obstruction, but the barium enema and intestinal biopsy findings would be different from those seen in congenital aganglionic megacolon."
