The question does not provide any context or details about the program, such as its name, location, or target population. Without this information, it is impossible to determine when the program was started. \nAdditionally, the question does not specify which country or region the program is located in. Mental health programs can vary significantly depending on the country or region, so it is important to consider the geographical context when answering this question. \nIn order to provide an accurate answer, I would need more information about the specific mental health program being referred to, including its name, location, target population, and any other relevant details. \n"
