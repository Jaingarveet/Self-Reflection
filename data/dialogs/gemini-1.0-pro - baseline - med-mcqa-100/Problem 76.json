A sudden increase in ETCO2 can be a sign of awareness.\n* BIS: This is a measure of the patient's brain activity. A low BIS score can be a sign of awareness.\n* AERIAL B.P: This is a measure of the patient's blood pressure. A sudden increase in blood pressure can be a sign of awareness.\n* NEUROMASCULAR MONITOR: This is a device that measures the patient's muscle activity. A sudden increase in muscle activity can be a sign of awareness.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
