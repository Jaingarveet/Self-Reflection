They will not provide blood supply to the upper limb if the second part of the axillary artery is blocked.\nOption C: The posterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the axillary artery below the blockage. The circumflex scapular artery is a branch of the subscapular artery, which is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery. This option does not provide a connection between arteries above and below the blockage.\nOption D: The suprascapular artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, which is a branch of the subclavian artery. The anterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch of the axillary artery below the blockage. This option provides a connection between the subclavian artery and the axillary artery below the blockage, which will maintain blood supply to the upper limb.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
