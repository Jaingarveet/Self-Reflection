The argument states that all small-property houses are not protected by law, but it does not state that all houses built on rural collective land are small-property houses. Therefore, the fact that the house is built on rural collective land weakens the argument.\n**Improved response:**\n**Thought:**\n* The argument claims that the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law because it is a small-property house.\n* However, the argument does not provide evidence that all houses built on rural collective land are small-property houses.\n* Therefore, the fact that the house is built on rural collective land weakens the argument.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")"
