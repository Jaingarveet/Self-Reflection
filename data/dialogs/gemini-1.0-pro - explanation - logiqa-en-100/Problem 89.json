(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\n"

However, the condition (3) explicitly states that a doctor treating a child must also treat an adult of the same sex. Since Dr.Zhang only treats males, he cannot treat J, who is a female child.\n**Correct answer:** A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n**Reasoning for correct answer:** \n* Dr.Zhang cannot treat J due to condition (3).\n* Dr.Li can only treat one patient, and since J is not treated by Dr.Zhang, Dr.Li must treat J.\n* Dr.Wang cannot treat J because he must treat an adult male if he treats J, but there is no available adult male patient.\n* Therefore, Dr.F must be responsible for treating J.\n**Action:** Answer(\"A\") \n"
