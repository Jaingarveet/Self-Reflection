I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* I previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all of the given conditions.\n* Specifically, I did not consider condition (3), which states that if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.\n* I also did not consider condition (5), which states that at least one of the same employees must be in both groups.\n**Answer:**\nBased on the given conditions, K can replace **H** in the printing group without violating any of the conditions.\n**Explanation:**\n* Replacing H with K in the printing group would satisfy condition (3) because J is already in the binding group.\n* It would also satisfy condition (5) because H is already in the binding group.\n* Replacing any other member of the printing group would violate one or more of the given conditions.\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C: H**."
