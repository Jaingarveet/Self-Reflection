This means that the increase in posts about social issues could be due to the fact that there are simply more people using the internet, rather than a deterioration in the social atmosphere.\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to consider all of the answer choices and choose the one that would most weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating.\nChoice A is irrelevant because it is a general statement about human nature that does not address the specific issue of the increase in posts about social issues.\nChoice B is the correct answer because it provides an alternative explanation for the increase in posts about social issues. If the number of internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, then it is likely that the increase in posts about social issues is simply due to the fact that there are more people using the internet.\nChoice C is irrelevant because it does not address the specific issue of the increase in posts about social issues.\nChoice D is irrelevant because it does not address the specific issue of the increase in posts about social issues.\nTherefore, the answer is B.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
