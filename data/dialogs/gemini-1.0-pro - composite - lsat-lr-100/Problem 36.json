This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.\n  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.\n  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.\n  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.\n  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the assumption on which the argument depends. \nMy error was in assuming that the argument relies on the claim that non-native speakers hear speech more accurately than native speakers. \nHowever, the argument actually relies on the claim that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than the perceptions of non-native speakers.\nError Keywords:\n - Assumption identification error\n - Argument interpretation error\n - False assumption error\nSolution:\nThe argument claims that native speakers' perception of their own language as sequences of separate words is an illusion. \nThis illusion is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.\nThe argument assumes that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the argument and identify the main claim.\n2. Identify the evidence provided to support the main claim.\n3. Identify the conclusion drawn from the evidence.\n4. Identify the assumptions on which the argument depends.\n5. Evaluate the strength of the argument by considering the assumptions, evidence, and conclusion.\n6. Choose the answer that correctly identifies the assumption on which the argument depends.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.\n - Consider the logical relationships between the different parts of the argument.\n - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.\n - Be aware of common fallacies and logical errors.\n - Evaluate the argument as a whole, not just individual parts.\n"
