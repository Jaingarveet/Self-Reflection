I focused on the fact that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals. However, I overlooked the crucial information that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This means that all the films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian films.\n**Solution:** To arrive at the correct answer, I need to consider the following:\n* All films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian.\n* Most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nTherefore, the correct answer must be a statement that reflects these two facts.\n**Correct Answer:**\n**C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the information provided. It acknowledges that some films winning prizes at international film festivals were Canadian, which aligns with the fact that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n**Instructions:**\n* I will carefully analyze the context and question, paying close attention to all details and keywords.\n* I will consider all answer choices and eliminate those that are clearly incorrect or contradict the information provided.\n* I will focus on identifying the answer that accurately reflects the information and aligns with the logical reasoning based on the context.\n* I will double-check my answer before submitting it to ensure accuracy.\n**Advice:**\n* Pay close attention to details and keywords in the context and question.\n* Consider all answer choices carefully and eliminate those that are clearly incorrect.\n* Focus on identifying the answer that accurately reflects the information and aligns with the logical reasoning based on the context.\n* Double-check your answer before submitting it to ensure accuracy.\nBy following these steps and reflecting on my previous error, I am confident that I can answer this question correctly in the future.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")**"
