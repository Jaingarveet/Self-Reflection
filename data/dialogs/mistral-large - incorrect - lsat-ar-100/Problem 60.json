Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\n\nSince Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on day 7. This means that the breed of puppy featured on day 7 must be either a Newfoundland or a Rottweiler. However, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, so it must be a Newfoundland.\n\nSince Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1, they must be featured on some combination of days 2-6. They cannot be featured on any day that features Rottweilers, so they must be featured on days that feature either Greyhounds or Newfoundlands. Since Greyhounds are only featured on day 1, Himalayans must be featured on days that feature Newfoundlands.\n\nThe only answer choice that satisfies all of these conditions is choice C: Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
