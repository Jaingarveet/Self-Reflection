Steel is a valuable material that can be melted down and reformed into new products without losing its quality, making it an ideal candidate for recycling. In contrast, glass bottles, paper containers, and plastic containers have limitations in their ability to be reused and are not as sustainable as steel cans. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) steel cans."
