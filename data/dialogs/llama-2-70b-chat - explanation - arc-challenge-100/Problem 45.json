If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?\nChoices:\n  A: 31 pounds and 14 kilograms\n  B: 31 pounds and 84 kilograms\n  C: 186 pounds and 14 kilograms\n  D: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in my calculation of the weight of the astronaut on the Moon.\nI correctly calculated the weight of the astronaut on the Moon as 31/6 = 5 pounds, but then I incorrectly converted it to kilograms.\nI mistakenly thought that 5 pounds was equal to 14 kilograms, when in fact it is equal to approximately 2.3 kilograms.\n"
