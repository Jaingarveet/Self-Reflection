        "content": "## Self-Reflection\n**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C: $y=40-21 t$\n**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I mistakenly interpreted the rate of change as a decrease in altitude instead of an increase.\n**Correct Answer:** B: $y=40+21 t$\n**Reasoning for Correct Answer:**\n1. **Initial value (y-intercept):** The helicopter starts at an altitude of 40 feet, so the y-intercept is 40.\n2. **Rate of change (slope):** The helicopter gains altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second, so the slope is 21.\n3. **Equation of the line:** Using the slope-intercept form, the equation of the line is $y=21t+40$.\n4. **Substitution:** Substituting the values of the slope and y-intercept, we get $y=21t+40$.\n5. **Simplification:** The equation is already in its simplest form.\nTherefore, the correct function representing the helicopter's altitude is $y=40+21 t$.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
