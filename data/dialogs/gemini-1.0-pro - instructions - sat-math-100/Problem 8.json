Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $0.88 p$\n  B: $\\frac{p}{0.88}$\n  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$\n  D: $\\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the original price of the computer as x.\n2. Calculate the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (1 - discount).\n3. Calculate the final price by multiplying the discounted price by (1 + sales tax).\n4. Set the final price equal to p dollars.\n5. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.\n6.
