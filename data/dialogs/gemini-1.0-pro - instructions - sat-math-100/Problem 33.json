I will reflect on my previous mistake and use the information to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I incorrectly chose option A in my previous attempt.\n* **Reason for mistake:** I mistakenly used the radius as the coefficient for both the x and y terms in the equation.\n* **Correct approach:** The radius represents the distance from the center to any point on the circle. Therefore, the equation should be written as $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.\n**Answer:**\nBased on the self-reflection and the correct approach, the equation of the circle is:\n$(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 2^2$\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$**.\n**Action:** Answer(\"C\")"
