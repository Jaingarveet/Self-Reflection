This was incorrect because I did not consider the second inequality carefully enough.\n**Reflection on the Problem:**\nThe system of inequalities is:\n$$\\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\\\& y>x+b\\end{aligned}$$\nThe solution point is $(0,0)$. This means that the coordinates of the point satisfy both inequalities.\n**Reflection on My Solution:**\nI substituted the solution point into the first inequality and obtained:\n$$0<-0+a$$\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n$$a>0$$\nI then substituted the solution point into the second inequality and obtained:\n$$0>0+b$$\nSimplifying this inequality, we get:\n$$b<0$$\nTherefore, I concluded that $a>b$.\n**Reflection on the Correct Answer:**\nHowever, I realized that I had not considered the second inequality carefully enough. The second inequality states that $y$ is greater than $x+b$. Since the solution point is $(0,0)$, this means that $0$ is greater than $0+b$. This implies that $b$ is negative.\nTherefore, the correct relationship between $a$ and $b$ is $b<a$.\n**Corrected Answer:**\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
