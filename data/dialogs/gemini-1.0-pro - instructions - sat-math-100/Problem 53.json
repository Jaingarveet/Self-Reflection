Identify the slope of the line.\n2. Remember that the slope represents the change in $y$ for every 1 unit change in $x$.\n3. Starting from the origin, move the $x$ coordinate by the desired amount.\n4. Calculate the corresponding change in $y$ based on the slope.\n5. Move the $y$ coordinate by the calculated amount.\n6.
