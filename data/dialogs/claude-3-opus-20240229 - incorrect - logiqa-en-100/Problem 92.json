Professor Qian said the champion is not Tsinghua, but is USTC (University of Science and Technology of China).\n3. Professor Sun said the champion is not USTC, but is Tsinghua.\nWe're told that only one professor was completely correct, one was completely wrong, and one was half right.\n4. Professors Qian and Sun directly contradict each other about whether the champion is Tsinghua or USTC. So one of them must be the completely wrong one.\n5. This means Professor Zhao must be the one who is half right. He said it's not Tsinghua or Zhejiang. \n6. If Zhao is half right, then either Tsinghua or Zhejiang is not the champion, and some other team is the champion.\n7. Since Qian and Sun contradict each other, if one is fully right then the other must be fully wrong. \n8. If Sun is right, then Tsinghua is the champion. But this contradicts Zhao. So Sun can't be fully right.\n9. Therefore, Qian must be the professor who is fully right. This means USTC is the champion.\n10. Zhejiang is the only other option listed, so by process of elimination, it must be Zhejiang that Zhao was right about not being the champion.\nIn conclusion, USTC is the champion according to the information given.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
