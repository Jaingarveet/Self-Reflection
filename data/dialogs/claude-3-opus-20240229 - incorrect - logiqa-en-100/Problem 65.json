The survey found that traffic accident rates are similar between cities that strictly investigate drunk driving and those that don't. \n2. However, experts believe strict drunk driving enforcement should reduce accidents. This seems contradictory.\n3. To resolve this inconsistency, we need to find an explanation for why the accident rates could be similar despite differing enforcement.\n4. Choice A doesn't help explain the similarity, as it just states accidents have occurred in cities with strict enforcement. This doesn't address the contradiction.\n5. Choice B provides a potential explanation - even cities with strict enforcement may not have fully eliminated drunk driving. So drunk driving could still be causing accidents despite the enforcement efforts. This helps resolve the inconsistency.\n6. Choice C suggests driver awareness is more important than enforcement. While this may be true, it doesn't directly explain the similar accident rates with differing enforcement levels. It doesn't resolve the core inconsistency.\n7. Choice D suggests other violations beyond drunk driving should also be enforced. While a good suggestion, this doesn't explain why accident rates are currently similar despite different drunk driving enforcement. It doesn't directly address resolving the inconsistency.\nTherefore, Choice B provides the best explanation to eliminate the inconsistency between the survey results and expert expectations. It suggests that even with enforcement, drunk driving may not be fully eliminated, allowing it to still cause accidents.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
