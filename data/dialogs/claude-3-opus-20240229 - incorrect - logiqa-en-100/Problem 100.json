If H is in Team 2, then Q must be in the middle of Team 1 (given condition 6).\n3. L must be in Team 1 (given condition 3).\n4. P cannot be in Team 1, because P cannot be with Q (given condition 5).\n5. N cannot be in Team 1, because N cannot be with Q (inferred from conditions 4 and 2 - N can't be with P or K, and K must be in the middle if playing, so N can't be with Q in the middle).\n6. So with H in Team 2, the only possible arrangement for Team 1 is:\n   Front: L\n   Middle: Q\n   Back: G\nTherefore, the answer is C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
