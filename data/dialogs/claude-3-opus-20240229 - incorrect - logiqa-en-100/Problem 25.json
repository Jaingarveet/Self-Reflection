Since there are only 2 doctors total, Li Qiang and Liu Dawei cannot be doctors.\n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height. Since one man is not tall, they must both be either tall or not tall.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. This means Li Qiang is not tall (since we know Wang Wei is a doctor and there are 3 tall men, Wang Wei must be tall). \n5. From 3 and 4, we can conclude Liu Dawei is also not tall.\n6. The prince Li Na has in mind is tall, handsome and a doctor. Wu Gang is the only one who could fit this description. Wang Wei is ruled out because he's not handsome (only 1 man is handsome). Li Qiang and Liu Dawei are ruled out because they are not tall and not doctors.\nTherefore, the answer must be C: Wu Gang is the only one who meets all of Li Na's requirements.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
