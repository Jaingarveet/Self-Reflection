So they will either be in production or sales. \n3. If X is in sales, then W must be in production (given). \n4. F and G can't be together (given), and F is in production, so G must be in either public relations or sales.\n5. There is only 1 spot in public relations. If G takes that, then H, I, W, X, Y are left for 3 production and 3 sales roles.\n6. If G is in sales instead, that leaves H, I, W, X, Y for 2 sales roles and H, I, W, X, Y for the 3 production roles (since H and Y must be together).\n7. Looking at the answer choices:\n   A) G and I - possible if G is in sales \n   B) G and X - possible if G is in sales\n   C) G and Y - not possible since H and Y must be together, but F and G can't be\n   D) H and W - possible if H and Y are in sales and X is not\nTherefore, G and Y are the pair that is most unlikely to be in sales together.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
