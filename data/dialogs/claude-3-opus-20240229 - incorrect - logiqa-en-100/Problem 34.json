Or in other words, don't treat others in ways you wouldn't want to be treated.\n2. Choice A says \"Only those who do what they want can do it to others.\" This does not logically follow. Confucius is saying don't do things to others you don't want done to you. He's not saying you can do whatever you want to others as long as you're okay with it being done to you.\n3. Choice B says \"If you want, then give it to others.\" This is consistent with the Golden Rule. If there is a way you want to be treated, it's good to treat others that way.\n4. Choice C says \"Don't treat others unless you want to.\" This also follows the Golden Rule in a backwards way. It's saying only treat others in ways you'd want to be treated.\n5. Choice D says \"Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.\" This generalizes Confucius's statement to say we should only do to people what they want. But his actual statement was about what you want for yourself, not what others want.\nTherefore, the choice that does not logically follow from Confucius's statement is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
