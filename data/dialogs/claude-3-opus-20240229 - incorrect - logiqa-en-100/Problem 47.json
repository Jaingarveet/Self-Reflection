        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The first sentence states that for listed companies, only those with dividends can issue new stocks. \n2. The second sentence says that if a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.\n3. The third sentence states that if a company needs financing, there is no way for it to pay dividends.\nNow let's consider each answer choice:\nA. A listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends.\n   This statement follows logically from the given information. If a company has dividends, it does not need financing (sentence 2). And if it needs financing, it cannot have dividends (sentence 3).\nB. A listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends. \n   This is not necessarily true. A listed company may not need financing and may have dividends.\nC. A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends.\n   This statement must be true. If a company has dividends, it does not need funds (sentence 2), so it does not need to issue new stocks. And only companies with dividends can issue new stocks (sentence 1).\nD. The only way for a listed company to finance is to issue new stocks.\n   This is not necessarily true. The statements do not say that issuing new stocks is the only way for a listed company to finance itself.\nTherefore, the answer that cannot be false is C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
