If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can actually achieve a 20% productivity increase.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) This is not necessarily true. If Green Island increases productivity by 10-19%, it will avoid bankruptcy even though it didn't hit the 20% goal.\nB) This is true. If productivity increases by 20%, that exceeds the 10% requirement to avoid bankruptcy.\nC) This is true. The need to increase productivity is due to recent market changes. If the market hadn't changed, the productivity increase wouldn't be necessary.\nD) This contradicts the given information. We're told that if 10% is achievable, then 20% is also achievable. So 20% is not impossible if 10% can be done.\nBetween B and C, B directly addresses what will happen if the 20% goal is met, while C introduces the tangential idea of markets not changing. \nTherefore, B is the best answer, as it most directly relates to the key facts in the question.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
