        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know F must be in the production department based on condition (4).\n2. The question states that X and F are assigned to the same department. Since F is in production, this means X must also be in the production department.\n3. Based on condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. However, we determined X is in production, not sales. Therefore, W does not have to be in production. W could be in either sales or public relations.\n4. H and Y must be in the same department according to condition (1). Since there are 3 people in production (including F and X), and 3 people in sales, the only department H and Y can be in together is sales.\n5. This leaves I, G and W. We know F and G can't be in the same department based on condition (2). Since F is in production, G must be in either sales or public relations.\n6. If G is in sales, then I and W must be in public relations and production respectively (since sales is full with H, Y and G). \n7. If G is in public relations, then I and W must be in sales and production respectively.\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. G being in sales is possible, as explained above.\nB. H must be in sales with Y, not production.\nC. I being in sales is possible if G is in public relations.\nD. W being in public relations is possible if G is in sales.\nTherefore, the only statement that cannot be true is B - H being assigned to the production department.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
