It doesn't address why those who favor them still wouldn't hire them.\nB: If a majority of respondents are only willing to pay a low salary, this could explain why they wouldn't actually hire college students as nannies, even if they favor the idea in principle. College students may not accept such low pay.\nC: This also doesn't explain the discrepancy, as it only describes why people think nannying is good for the students, not why they wouldn't hire them.\nD: This is about people who don't approve of college nannies at all, so it doesn't explain why those who do approve still wouldn't hire them.\nTherefore, B is the best explanation. If the offered salary is too low, people may like the idea of college nannies but still not actually hire them.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
