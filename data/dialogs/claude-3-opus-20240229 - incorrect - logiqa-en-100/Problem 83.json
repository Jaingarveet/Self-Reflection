The question states that H does not participate.\nNow, let's consider each answer choice:\nA. F and G: This is possible. If F participates, then M could also participate. And if J doesn't participate, G still could.\nB. E and M: This is not possible. If E participates, then F does not. But M can only participate if F does. So E and M can't both participate.\nC. F and K: This is possible. If F participates, then J does not, so K could. And M could also participate since F is.\nD. G and K: This is not guaranteed. If J participates, then G must also participate. But if J participates, then K cannot. So G and K are not guaranteed to participate together.\nTherefore, the only two players that must be included if H does not participate are F and K.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
