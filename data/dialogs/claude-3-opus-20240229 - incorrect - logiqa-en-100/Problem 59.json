F and G cannot be in the same department (given). Since F is in production, G cannot be in production.\n4. If X is in sales, then W must be in production (given). \nLooking at the choices:\nA: This violates condition 2, as H and Y are not in the same department. \nB: This violates condition 3, as F and G cannot be in the same department, but here they are both in sales.\nC: This satisfies all conditions. X is in PR, so condition 4 doesn't apply. F is in production, H and Y are together in sales, and G is not with F.\nD: This violates condition 2, as H and Y are not in the same department.\nTherefore, C is the only choice that satisfies all the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
