Condition (2) states that paper G or H can only be used if paper J is not used. But it doesn't say that both G and H must be used together. So choice B is not necessarily true.\n3. Condition (3) states that if paper G is not used, then paper K is also not needed. But this doesn't mean the converse - that if G is used, K must be used. The question stem also doesn't provide information to conclude that J is not used. So we can't be sure about choice C.\n4. Condition (2) states that G or H can only be used if J is not used. In other words, if J is used, then neither G nor H can be used. This matches with choice D.\nTherefore, if all the given conditions are true, choice D must be true - if paper J is used, then both papers G and H cannot be used.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
