It doesn't directly address the argument.\nB) If the number of internet users has quadrupled, that could explain the increases in posts without necessarily meaning there is more crime, poverty, etc. in absolute terms. There's just more people posting in general.\nC) This suggests some posts may be rumors rather than factual, but it doesn't fully explain the large increases cited.\nD) The forum being legal doesn't seem directly relevant to weakening the argument.\nTherefore, B seems to weaken the argument the most by providing an alternative explanation - the increases are just due to the user base growing, not necessarily society worsening.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
