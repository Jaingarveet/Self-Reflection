The tools and utensils found could have been burial goods rather than signs of habitation.\nC: Whether or not earlier prehistoric villages have been found in Europe is not directly relevant to refuting the claim about this specific cave.\nD: The entrance collapsing 5000 years ago doesn't refute Neolithic Age habitation, since the Neolithic Age was much earlier, ending over 4000 BC.\nTherefore, B is the best choice to refute the argument. If the cave was a cemetery rather than a dwelling place, the conclusion that hundreds of people lived there would not be supported.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
