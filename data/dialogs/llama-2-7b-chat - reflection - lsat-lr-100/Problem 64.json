Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears\n  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon\n  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon\n  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition\n\n  The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument... (Answer: C) fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well.\n\nThe argument assumes that crying reduces emotional stress because of the shedding of tears, but it does not consider the possibility that other factors may also play a role in reducing emotional stress, such as the social support provided by crying or the cognitive reappraisal of emotions that occurs during the crying process. Therefore, the argument does not provide a comprehensive explanation for the observed correlation between crying and reduced emotional stress.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
