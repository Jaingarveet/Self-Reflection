Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Therefore, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.\nQuestion: Which one of the following uses flawed reasoning most similar to that used in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.\n  B: Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians.\n  C: Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly. Thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment.\n  D: Some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend. Thus, some of the decisions regarding school curricula should be made without regard for the wishes of the children's parents.\n  E: Only a small percentage of the profits that companies make are directly attributable to good management decisions. Thus, even companies that are managed badly will usually turn a profit.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe argument in option C uses flawed reasoning similar to the one used in the argument above. In both arguments, a generalization is made based on a minority of cases, and then used to draw a conclusion about the majority.\n\nIn option C, the argument states that some corporations feign concern for the environment when advertising a product as environmentally friendly, and then concludes that no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment. Similarly, in the argument above, it is stated that only a minority of people engage in political action out of a sense of social justice, and then concluded that some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action.\n\nBoth arguments are flawed because they make a hasty generalization based on a limited sample size, and then use that generalization to make a conclusion about the entire group.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
