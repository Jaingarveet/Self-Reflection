        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\n\n  To strengthen the argument that lawmakers in certain jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery, the most relevant choice would be (C): Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n\nThis choice suggests that lawmakers in those jurisdictions take into account the severity of the harm caused by a particular crime when determining the appropriate penalty. If the harm caused by theft is seen as equivalent to the harm caused by bribery, it is likely that lawmakers would mandate a similar penalty for both crimes.\n\nChoices (A) and (B) are not directly relevant to the argument, as they do not address the specific context of the question. Choice (D) is incorrect because the question does not suggest that the harm caused by theft and bribery is the same, but rather that lawmakers in certain jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery. Choice (E) is not a logical conclusion from the given information, as it does not explain why lawmakers in those jurisdictions would mandate penalties that are proportional to the harm resulting from crimes.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
