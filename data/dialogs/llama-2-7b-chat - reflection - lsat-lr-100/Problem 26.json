        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\n\n  Thought: The statements provided suggest that both monstrous beast and mad scientist horror stories typically involve violations of the laws of nature and are intended to evoke dread in the reader.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. This is true for both monstrous beast and mad scientist horror stories.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": " Explanation:\nThe statements provided suggest that both monstrous beast and mad scientist horror stories typically involve violations of the laws of nature and are intended to evoke dread in the reader. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\n\nExplanation for each choice:\n\nA: All descriptions of monstrous beasts do not necessarily describe violations of the laws of nature. While many monstrous beasts are depicted as supernatural or unnatural creatures that defy the laws of nature, some may also be depicted as having a rational or scientific explanation for their existence.\n\nB: This choice is incorrect because not all stories that describe a violation of a law of nature are intended to invoke dread in the reader. Some stories may describe scientific or natural phenomena in a neutral or informative manner, without intending to evoke an emotional response.\n\nC: While some horror stories may involve psychologically disturbed characters, this is not a universal feature of all horror stories. Many horror stories involve ordinary people facing supernatural or monstrous threats, and these characters may not be psychologically disturbed.\n\nD: This choice is incorrect because most stories about mad scientists do not express the author's antiscientific views. While some mad scientist stories may be critical of unchecked scientific progress or the dangers of playing God, many others simply depict a scientist who has gone mad or is pursuing unethical goals.\n\nE: This choice is correct because some stories that employ symbolism may describe violations of the laws of nature, even if the story is not primarily focused on horror or supernatural elements. For example, a story that uses a monstrous beast as a symbol of a character's inner turmoil or psychological distress may still describe a violation of the laws of nature, even if the primary focus of the story is not horror."
