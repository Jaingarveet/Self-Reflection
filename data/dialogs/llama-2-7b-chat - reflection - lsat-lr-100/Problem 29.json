Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Acquiring complete detailed information about all the pros and cons of a product one might purchase would clearly be difficult and expensive. It is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. Therefore, consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are thereby behaving rationally.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information.\n  B: Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information.\n  C: The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  D: Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n  E: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\n  The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if the assumption is:\n\nE: Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe argument states that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information about a product unless they expect that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty. Therefore, the assumption that consumers who do not bother to acquire detailed information do not expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty is a logical conclusion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information usually do not bother to acquire such information. This is not the conclusion of the argument, which is that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it states that whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information. This is a contradiction of the argument, which states that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it states that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. This is not the conclusion of the argument, which is that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. This is a different conclusion than the argument, which states that it is rational for consumers not to acquire detailed information unless they expect the benefits to outweigh the cost and difficulty.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
