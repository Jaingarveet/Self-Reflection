Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements?\nChoices:\n  A: Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun.\n  B: Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements.\n  C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.\n  E: No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"B\")\n\nThe journalist's statements suggest that the presence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere is indicative of an incomplete mixing of elements in the object's internal nuclear furnace. This implies that any object with lithium in its atmosphere has a less complete nuclear furnace than a star with the same mass as the Sun. Therefore, option B is the most strongly supported by the journalist's statements.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

        "content": " Explanation:\nThe journalist's statements provide information about the relationship between the presence of lithium in a celestial object's atmosphere and the object's internal nuclear furnace. Based on the statements, the most strongly supported answer is option C: No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.\n\nThe journalist explains that stars with more mass than the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. This means that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is likely to be a brown dwarf, which does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace. Therefore, option C is the most strongly supported by the journalist's statements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the journalist does not provide any information to suggest that any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is necessarily a star with less mass than the Sun. Option B is also incorrect because the journalist's statements do not provide any information about the relationship between the presence of lithium in an object's atmosphere and the object's mass. Option D is incorrect because the journalist's statements do not provide any information about the relationship between lithium and the mass of a celestial object. Option E is incorrect because the journalist's statements do not provide any information about the presence of lithium in the atmospheres of celestial objects with different masses."
