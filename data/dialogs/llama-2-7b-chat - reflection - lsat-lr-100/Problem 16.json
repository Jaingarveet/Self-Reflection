Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality.\n  B: If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining.\n  C: Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.\n  D: The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level.\n  E: Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s.\n\n  Thought: Based on the given statements, the correct answer is (C) Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.\n\nThe statement \"Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals\" implies that the current habitat is already occupied by the maximum number of Florida panthers that it can sustain. Therefore, if the population is to reach 250, which is the minimum number required for self-sustainability, the panthers will need to acquire a larger habitat.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the statement does not mention anything about the quality of the current habitat.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because the statement does not guarantee that the population will be self-sustaining if it ever exceeds 250.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect because the statement does not provide any information about the future population growth of Florida panthers.\n\nOption (E) is incorrect because the statement does not mention anything about the size of the Florida panthers' habitat in the 1970s.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C\nError: You did not provide your answer in the correct format.\nYour answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")';\nwhere [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice."
