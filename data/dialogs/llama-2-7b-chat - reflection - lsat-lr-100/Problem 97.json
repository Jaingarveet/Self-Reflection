Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains?\nChoices:\n  A: It is the main conclusion of the argument.\n  B: It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut.\n  C: It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion.\n  D: It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.\n  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe statement \"cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains\" is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by providing a reason why recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised. The argument is that since cell-phone use is already bothersome on buses and trains, it would be even more disruptive and annoying on airplanes where passengers are more tightly packed and have limited options to move to another seat. This premise supports the main conclusion that allowing cell-phone use on airplanes is not a good idea.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "  Thank you for providing the editorial and the question. Based on your answer, I will provide my explanation for why the correct answer is (D) It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.\n\nThe statement \"cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains\" is a premise that directly supports the main conclusion of the argument. The argument is that since cell-phone use is already bothersome on buses and trains, it would be even more disruptive and annoying on airplanes where passengers are more tightly packed and have limited options to move to another seat. This premise provides a reason why recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised, and it is directly used to support the argument's main conclusion.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because the statement is not the main conclusion of the argument. The main conclusion is that recent proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised, and the statement provided is one of the reasons why.\n\nOption (B) is also incorrect because the argument is not trying to rebut any claim. The statement is a premise that directly supports the main conclusion.\n\nOption (C) is partially correct, as the statement does provide a reason why cell-phone use would be more disruptive on airplanes than on buses and trains. However, the statement is not a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion.\n\nOption (E) is incorrect because the statement provides background information that is relevant to the argument, but it does not play a direct role in the reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion."
