        "content": " Explanation:\nThe correct answer is (A) A concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance.\n\nThe principle above states that challenge can be an important source of self-knowledge, and this is demonstrated in the scenario provided. The concert pianist experiences a memory lapse during a difficult performance, but instead of viewing it as a negative event, they take the opportunity to understand why it occurred. By doing so, they can gain useful insights into their own weaknesses and better prepare for future performances.\n\nThis scenario aligns with the principle because the pianist is not dismissing the memory lapse or ignoring it, but rather taking a proactive approach to understanding and improving their performance. This shows that they are open to learning and self-reflection, which are key aspects of self-knowledge.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not conform to the principle:\n\n* (B) A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. While this is true, it does not relate to the principle of using challenge as a source of self-knowledge.\n* (C) Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people. While compassion is important, it is not directly related to the principle.\n* (D) While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself. This option suggests that competition is primarily about the enjoyment of the activity itself, rather than using it as an opportunity for self-knowledge.\n* (E) Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups. While this option suggests that taking on challenges can be fulfilling, it does not specifically relate to the principle of using challenge as a source of self-knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (A) A concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance."
