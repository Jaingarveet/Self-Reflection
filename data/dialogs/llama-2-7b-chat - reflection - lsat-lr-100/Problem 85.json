To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction?\nChoices:\n  A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.\n  B: Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably.\n  C: The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.\n  D: Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games.\n  E: Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games\n\n Thought: The most support for the president's prediction is provided by choice A: Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature, and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially.\n\nExplanation: If Ditalgame has invested a significant amount of money in developing the new copy protection feature, and the company's sales are not increasing, then it is unlikely that the new feature will lead to a substantial increase in sales. Therefore, choice A provides the most support for the president's prediction.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

If the feature is making the game more enjoyable or desirable, then it is likely that sales will increase.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
