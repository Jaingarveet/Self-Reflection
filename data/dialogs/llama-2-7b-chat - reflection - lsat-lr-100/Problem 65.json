Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: The size of northern fur seals provides a reliable indication of their population levelsâ€”the smaller the average body size of seals in a population, the larger the population. Archaeologists studied seal fossils covering an 800-year period when the seals were hunted for food by Native peoples in North America and found that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly.\nQuestion: The statements above, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: During the 800-year period studied, seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America.\n  B: The body size of northern fur seals is not strongly correlated with the overall health of the seals.\n  C: Before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically.\n  D: Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in order to prevent depletion of seal populations.\n  E: Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe statement \"Before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically\" best supports choice C. The passage states that the average body size of seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, but it does not provide any information about the body size of seals before that period. Therefore, it is possible that the body size of seals fluctuated significantly before the 800-year period studied, which would support choice C.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nThe correct answer is (E) Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.\n\nThe passage provides evidence that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, which suggests that the population size of seals was relatively stable. However, the passage does not provide any information about the impact of hunting by Native peoples on the seal population. Therefore, it is possible that hunting by Native peoples did not significantly reduce the seal population over the 800-year period studied, which supports choice (E).\n\nThe other options are not supported by the passage:\n\n* Choice (A) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the variation in seal hunting practices between different groups of Native peoples in North America.\n* Choice (B) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the correlation between body size and overall health of northern fur seals.\n* Choice (D) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the effort made by Native peoples to limit their hunting of northern fur seals.\n\nIn conclusion, the passage provides evidence that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, but it does not provide any information about the impact of hunting by Native peoples on the seal population. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied."
