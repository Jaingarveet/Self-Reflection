        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Lawyer: Juries are traditionally given their instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language.\nQuestion: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n  A: Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  B: Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language.\n  C: Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors.\n  D: The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.\n  E: Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"E\")\n\nThe argument of the lawyer is that jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language to ensure that jurors have a basic but adequate understanding of their role, rather than being bogged down by convoluted and difficult-to-understand legalistic language.\n\nOption E is the exception to this argument, as it suggests that jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. This goes against the lawyer's argument that simplicity and clarity are important for ensuring that jurors understand their role and can apply it effectively.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "  Thank you for providing the context and question for the argument. Here's why option E is the exception to the lawyer's argument:\n\nThe lawyer argues that jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language to ensure that jurors have a basic but adequate understanding of their role. This is because the lawyer believes that greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions.\n\nOption E, on the other hand, suggests that jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. This goes against the lawyer's argument that simplicity and clarity are important for ensuring that jurors understand their role and can apply it effectively.\n\nWhile it is true that jurors do not need to know every detail of their role, a basic understanding of their responsibilities and the legal principles involved in the case is crucial for them to make informed decisions. Simplifying the instructions does not mean sacrificing accuracy or precision, but rather presenting the information in a way that is easy for jurors to understand.\n\nTherefore, option E is the exception to the lawyer's argument, as it suggests that the details of the role of the jurors can be adequately described in simple language, which contradicts the lawyer's claim that simplicity and clarity are important for ensuring that jurors understand their role."
