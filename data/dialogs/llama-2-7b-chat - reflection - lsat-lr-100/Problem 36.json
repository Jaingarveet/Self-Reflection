Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This assumption is choice B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.\n\nThe argument is based on the idea that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The argument shows that this perception is an illusion by pointing out that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.\n\nThe argument does not rely on the other options:\n\nOption A is not a assumption, as it is not a necessary condition for the argument.\n\nOption C is not a assumption, as it does not affect the argument's conclusion.\n\nOption D is not a assumption, as it is not related to the argument's premise.\n\nOption E is the correct assumption, as it is the basis for the argument.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n* Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.\n* Choose the best answer based on the argument.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy."
