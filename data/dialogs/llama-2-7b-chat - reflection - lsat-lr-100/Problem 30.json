        "content": "  Explanation:\nLarew and Mendota are debating whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile can be accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Mendota argues that while the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the context of the problem\n* Misinterpreting the information provided\n* Failing to consider all the relevant factors\n\nSolution:\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided and consider the context of the problem. The correct answer is (A) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. This is because the percentage change in average income provides a more accurate measure of the relative change in economic prosperity between the two groups, rather than just looking at the absolute amount of the increase in average income.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key points of contention between Larew and Mendota.\n2. Analyze the information provided and consider the context of the problem.\n3. Evaluate the arguments presented by both Larew and Mendota and determine which one is more persuasive.\n4. Choose the answer that best reflects the correct solution to the problem.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and identify the key points of contention between the two perspectives.\n* Analyze the information provided and consider the context of the problem before making a decision.\n* Evaluate the arguments presented by both perspectives and determine which one is more persuasive.\n* Always choose the answer that best reflects the correct solution to the problem.\n* Remember to consider all the relevant factors and avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions."
