        "content": "  Explanation:\nMike's reasoning can be justified based on the principle of \"lex non scripta\" or \"customary law,\" which allows for the use of something without permission if it has been used in a similar manner by others in the past. This principle is similar to option D.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using someone's property without their permission is generally considered theft, regardless of whether the person has used someone else's property without permission.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while it is generally important to tell the truth, there may be cases where it is permissible not to tell the truth, such as in situations where the truth could cause harm to someone.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while it may be permissible to use someone's property without their permission if they have used someone else's property without permission, this is not the same as saying that it is okay to use someone's property without their permission simply because someone else has done so.\n\nOption E is incorrect because the use of someone's property may be wrong even if the person is not directly harmed by that use. For example, using someone's property without their permission may still be considered a violation of their rights or a breach of trust.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others."
