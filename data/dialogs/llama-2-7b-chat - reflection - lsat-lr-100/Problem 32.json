Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"A\")\n\nThe argument in the editorial depends on the assumption that it is inconsistent for a legislator to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and then vote against increasing spending on education. This is because the editorial argues that the political party in question has expressed both views, which suggests that their policy is inconsistent. Therefore, option A is the best answer.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nThe argument in the editorial relies on the assumption that a legislator's claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and their vote against increasing spending on education are inconsistent. This assumption is based on the fact that the political party in question has expressed both views, which suggests that their policy is inconsistent.\n\nThe other options do not accurately describe the assumption made in the editorial:\n\nOption B is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the inconsistency between the party's expressed views on education spending.\n\nOption C is also not relevant, as the editorial does not argue that the party's goal of increasing spending on education is morally wrong.\n\nOption E is also not relevant, as the editorial does not suggest that members of one political party never have inconsistent views on political issues.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed. The editorial assumes that the party's inconsistent views on education spending are a result of an inconsistent political policy."
