        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?\nChoices:\n  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.\n  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.\n\n  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n\nThe study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine. This is consistent with the idea that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n\nThe other options do not explain the finding of the nicotine study:\n\n* Option (A) is incorrect because the study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine.\n* Option (B) is irrelevant to the study's findings. The study did not examine the number of cigarettes smoked per day, so it cannot be used to explain the finding that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.\n* Option (D) is incorrect because the study did not measure the level of tar in the cigarettes smoked by the participants.\n* Option (E) is incorrect because the study did not examine the rate at which the level of nicotine in the blood decreases after smoking cigarettes is discontinued.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

Your explanation for why you chose the correct answer is clear and concise.\n\nTo expand on your answer, the correct choice, option (C), Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, is the best explanation for the finding of the nicotine study. The study showed that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked.
