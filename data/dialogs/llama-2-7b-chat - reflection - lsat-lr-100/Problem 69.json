        "content": "Explanation:\nI miscalculated the product of the number of letters in the city and state names. \nThe gap in my knowledge was not in geography but in basic arithmetic. \nI knew the correct city and state but made a calculation error.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Arithmetic error\n - Multiplication error\nSolution:\nIowa State University is located in the city of Ames\nIowa State University is located in the state of Iowa.\nThe city name \"Ames\" contains 4 letters.\nThe state name \"Iowa\" contains 4 letters.\nThe product of 4*4 is 16.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This supports the idea that the accuracy of a scientific theory's predictions is a valid reason to justify its acceptance, as per principle (C).\n\nHere's why the other options are not the best answer:\n\nA) This principle does not directly support the reasoning given in the passage. While it may be desirable to have fewer counterintuitive consequences, it is not a sufficient reason to accept a scientific theory.\n\nB) This principle is related to the idea of empirical evidence, but it does not directly address the issue of counterintuitive consequences. While a theory that has withstood serious attempts to disprove it may be more likely to be accepted, the accuracy of its predictions is a more direct reason to justify its acceptance.\n\nD) This principle is related to the idea of empirical evidence, but it does not directly address the issue of counterintuitive consequences. While a theory that has not been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it may be more likely to be rejected, the accuracy of its predictions is a more direct reason to justify its acceptance.\n\nE) This principle is related to the idea of empirical evidence, but it does not directly address the issue of counterintuitive consequences.
