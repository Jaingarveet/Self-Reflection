Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

However, Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they are out. This leaves George, Irving, and Nina for the afternoon reports. But George can only report on Tuesday, so he takes the Tuesday afternoon slot. This leaves Irving and Nina for Monday and Wednesday afternoon. But if Nina reports on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both report on Tuesday, which is impossible because Helen is already giving a morning report and George is giving the Tuesday afternoon report. Therefore, Nina must report on Wednesday afternoon, and Irving must report on Monday afternoon. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
