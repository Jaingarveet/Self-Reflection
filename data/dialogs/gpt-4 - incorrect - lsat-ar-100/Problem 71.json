Also, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 1 or 2, so they must be in Zone 3. Similarly, Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 1, so they must be in Zone 2 or 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3. Therefore, the representatives in Zone 3 could be Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
