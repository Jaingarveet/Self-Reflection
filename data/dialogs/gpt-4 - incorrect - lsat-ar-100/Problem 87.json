This means that at least one French novel must be selected. There is no requirement for a French play to be selected, so choice A is incorrect. There is no requirement for a Russian play to be selected, so choice B is incorrect. There is no requirement for a Russian novel to be selected, so choice C is incorrect. There is no requirement for two French novels to be selected, so choice D is incorrect. The only remaining choice is E, but there is no requirement for two Russian novels to be selected. However, since the organizer must select at least three novels and at least as many French novels as Russian novels, the organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian novel. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed among the choices. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
