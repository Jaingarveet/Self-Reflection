I should have remembered that NADH is reduced, while NAD is the oxidized form. \n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Factual error\n*   Biochemistry knowledge gap\n*   Redox state confusion \n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n1.  **Recall the process:** Anaerobic glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose without oxygen, resulting in the production of ATP.\n2.  **Identify key molecules:** The process involves NAD+, which acts as an electron carrier.\n3.  **Consider redox reactions:** During glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH by accepting electrons.\n4.  **Analyze end products:** Therefore, the end products of anaerobic glycolysis include 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules (the reduced form of NAD+).\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1.  Review the fundamentals of redox reactions and the roles of NAD+/NADH.\n2.  Pay close attention to the specific molecules involved in each metabolic pathway.\n3.  Differentiate between oxidized and reduced forms of electron carriers.\n4.  Practice applying knowledge to different biochemical scenarios.\n**General Advice:**\n*   **Strengthen foundational knowledge:** Ensure a solid understanding of core concepts before tackling complex topics.\n*   **Focus on details:** Pay attention to subtle differences between molecules and processes.\n*   **Visualize the process:** Use diagrams or mental imagery to understand the flow of reactions.\n*   **Practice active recall:** Regularly test your knowledge to reinforce learning.\n"
