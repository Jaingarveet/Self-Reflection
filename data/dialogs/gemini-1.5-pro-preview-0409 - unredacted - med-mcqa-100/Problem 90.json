It can be due to:\nChoices:\n  A: Oligohydramnios\n  B: Placenta pre\n  C: Pelvic tumor\n  D: Uterine anomalies\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed. While oligohydramnios can restrict fetal movement, it's not the only factor influencing fetal lie. I failed to consider that placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie by physically obstructing the fetus from settling into a head-down position.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Incorrect reasoning\n*   Incomplete knowledge \n*   Misinterpretation of clinical scenario\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Understand the problem:** The question asks for the cause of an unstable lie at 34 weeks in a multigravida with previous normal deliveries.\n2. **Analyze the options:**\n    *   **Oligohydramnios:** Can restrict fetal movement, but not the only cause of unstable lie.\n    *   **Placenta previa:** Can physically obstruct the fetus from assuming a head-down position, leading to an unstable lie.\n    *   **Pelvic tumor:**  Less likely at this gestation with previous normal deliveries.\n    *   **Uterine anomalies:** Less likely with previous normal deliveries.\n3. **Choose the most likely cause:** Based on the analysis, placenta previa (B) is the most likely cause of an unstable lie in this scenario. \n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1. **Consider all possible causes:** Don't focus on just one factor, even if it seems likely. \n2. **Analyze each option carefully:** Evaluate how each option could contribute to the presented scenario.\n3. **Prioritize based on likelihood:** Consider the patient's history and the gestational age when assessing the likelihood of each option.\n4. **Review knowledge gaps:** If unsure, research the topic further to improve understanding.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Think comprehensively:** Consider all aspects of the patient's presentation and history.\n*   **Develop differential diagnoses:** List all possible causes and systematically evaluate each one.\n*   **Stay updated:** Continuously update medical knowledge to ensure accurate diagnoses.\n*   **Consult resources:** Utilize textbooks, medical journals, and colleagues for clarification and support.\n"
