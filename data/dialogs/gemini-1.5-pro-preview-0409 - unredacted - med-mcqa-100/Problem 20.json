My error was in attributing the proposal solely to Koch, neglecting Pasteur's foundational contributions.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Attribution error\n*   Historical figure identification error\n*   Germ theory of disease knowledge gap\n## Solving the Problem\n1.  **Recall the key figures in the history of germ theory:** Leeuwenhoek, Koch, Pasteur, and Paré.\n2.  **Eliminate options based on their contributions:**\n    *   Leeuwenhoek: First to observe microorganisms, but did not link them to disease.\n    *   Koch: Developed postulates to establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease.\n    *   Paré: Pioneer in surgery and battlefield medicine, predating germ theory.\n    *   **Pasteur:** Conducted experiments with fermentation and pasteurization, demonstrating the role of microbes in causing disease and spoilage.\n3.  **Identify the individual who proposed the theory:** Based on the analysis, Louis Pasteur is the most appropriate answer as he laid the groundwork for the germ theory with his experiments and observations.\n## Instructions for Future Problem Solving\n1.  **Carefully analyze the question:** Pay attention to keywords like \"proposed\" to understand the specific requirement.\n2.  **Review relevant historical figures and their contributions:** Ensure a comprehensive understanding of each individual's role in the development of the theory.\n3.  **Differentiate between observation, experimentation, and proposal:** Recognize the distinct stages in the development of a scientific theory.\n4.  **Consider the timeline of events:** Understand the chronological order of discoveries and proposals to accurately attribute the theory.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Strengthen knowledge base:** Continuously expand your understanding of key scientific figures and their contributions.\n*   **Develop critical thinking skills:** Analyze information carefully and avoid jumping to conclusions.\n*   **Pay attention to detail:** Focus on specific keywords and requirements within the question.\n*   **Learn from mistakes:** Reflect on errors and adjust your approach for future problem-solving.\n"
