After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?\nChoices:\n  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.\n  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.\n  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.\n  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], \"Test the antibiotic on human volunteers,\" as the way to strengthen the researchers' conclusions. However, testing on human volunteers is not a way to strengthen the conclusions drawn from limited testing. Instead, the researchers should ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic. This would provide an additional level of verification and validation of the initial findings.\n"
