To resolve this inconsistency, we need to find a reason why strict investigation of drunk driving does not necessarily lead to a decrease in traffic accidents. \nChoice A does not provide a reason for the inconsistency. \nChoice B suggests that even with strict investigation, drunk driving has not been eliminated, but it does not explain why the accident rate is still similar. \nChoice C suggests that improving drivers' safety awareness is more important than strict management, but it does not directly address the inconsistency. \nChoice D suggests that other traffic violations also contribute to traffic accidents, which could explain why the accident rate is similar despite strict investigation of drunk driving.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
