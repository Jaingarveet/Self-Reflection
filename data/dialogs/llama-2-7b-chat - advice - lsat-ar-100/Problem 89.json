Let me re-evaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\nAction: I will use the information provided in the problem to determine the possible combinations of batches made on each day.\n\nReflection: Based on the information given, we know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, from Monday to Friday. We also know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n\nLet's analyze the possible combinations of batches made on each day:\n\nMonday:\n\n* Oatmeal: 1 batch\n* Peanut butter: 1 batch\n* Sugar: 0 batches (since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday)\n\nTuesday:\n\n* Oatmeal: 0 batches (since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies)\n* Peanut butter: 1 batch\n* Sugar: 0 batches\n\nWednesday:\n\n* Oatmeal: 0 batches\n* Peanut butter: 0 batches\n* Sugar: 1 batch (since the first batch of sugar cookies is made on this day)\n\nThursday:\n\n* Oatmeal: 0 batches\n* Peanut butter: 0 batches\n* Sugar: 1 batch (since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on this day)\n\nFriday:\n\n* Oatmeal: 1 batch\n* Peanut butter: 0 batches\n* Sugar: 1 batch (since the third batch of sugar cookies is made on this day)\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA) The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. This is incorrect because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\n\nB) The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. This is incorrect because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n\nC) The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. This is incorrect because the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.\n\nD) The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. This is incorrect because the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies.\n\nE) The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This is incorrect because the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E) The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday."
