The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.\n  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.\n  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.\n  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.\n  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

The information provided in the problem statement indicates that there must be at least one scientist of each type on the panel, and that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI realized that the correct answer is option C, which states that if exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is because if more than one chemist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, and since P is the only zoologist, K must be selected. Additionally, since there must be at least one scientist of each type on the panel, K must be selected if M is selected."
