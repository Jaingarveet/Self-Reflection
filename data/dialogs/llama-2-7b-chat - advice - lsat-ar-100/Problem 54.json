Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.\n3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of plays reviewed by each student:\n\nJiang: Sunset, Undulation\nKramer: Tamerlane\nLopez: Undulation\nMegregian: Sunset, Tamerlane\nO'Neill: Tamerlane\n\nFrom the given conditions, we can deduce the following:\n\n* If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Lopez must review Undulation.\n* If Lopez does not review Undulation, then Megregian must review Sunset.\n* If Megregian does not review Sunset, then O'Neill must review Undulation.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Jiang reviews Sunset. This is not true, as Jiang does not review Sunset.\nB: Lopez reviews Undulation. This is true, as Lopez reviews Undulation.\nC: Megregian reviews Sunset. This is not true, as Megregian does not review Sunset.\nD: Megregian reviews Tamerlane. This is not true, as Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\nE: O'Neill reviews Undulation. This is true, as O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) Lopez reviews Undulation."
