Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

Let me re-evaluate the problem and the given conditions to find the correct answer.\n\nAction: I will use the information provided to determine which sales representatives work in Zone 3.\n\nReflection: Based on the conditions given, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Additionally, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n\nUsing this information, we can determine the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 as follows:\n\nEither Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, so one of them must work in Zone 3. Let's assume that Parra works in Zone 3.\n\nEither Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, so one of them must work in Zone 3. Let's assume that Tiao works in Zone 3.\n\nSince Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, they must work in the same zone as Tiao. Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3.\n\nStuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must work in the same zone as Tiao. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 3.\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is:\n\nD: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n\nI hope this reflection helps me answer the question correctly this time."
