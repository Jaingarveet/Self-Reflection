The organizer must select at least five works from the group of nine works, and the selection must conform to the given requirements.\n\nAction: Let's analyze the requirements again:\n\n* No more than four French works are selected, so we can eliminate options A and D.\n* At least three but no more than four novels are selected, so we can eliminate option C.\n* At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so we can eliminate option E.\n* If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so we can eliminate option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: one French novel and one French play.\n\nReflection: I made a mistake in my initial answer by not carefully reading the requirements. I should have paid closer attention to the constraints on the number of French works and the number of novels selected. Thank you for providing the opportunity to reflect on my mistake and improve my answer."
