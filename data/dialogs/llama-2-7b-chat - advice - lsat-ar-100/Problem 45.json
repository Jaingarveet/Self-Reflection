Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.\n  B: Image's website target is 2 days.\n  C: Image's website target is 1 day.\n  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.\n  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n"

None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.\n2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.\n3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of targets for each client:\n\nImage:\n\n* Voicemail target: X\n* Website target: Y\n\nSolide:\n\n* Voicemail target: Z\n* Website target: W\n\nTruvest:\n\n* Voicemail target: A\n* Website target: B\n\nFrom the conditions given, we can deduce the following:\n\n* X must be shorter than A.\n* Y must be shorter than B.\n* Z must be shorter than W.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each choice:\n\nA: Image's voicemail target is 2 days, which means X = 2. This is not shorter than A, so this choice is not the correct answer.\n\nB: Image's website target is 2 days, which means Y = 2. This is not shorter than B, so this choice is not the correct answer.\n\nC: Image's website target is 1 day, which means Y = 1. This is shorter than B, so this choice is the correct answer.\n\nD: Solide's website target is 2 days, which means W = 2. This is not shorter than D, so this choice is not the correct answer.\n\nE: Solide's website target is 1 day, which means W = 1. This is shorter than D, so this choice is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (E): Solide's website target is 1 day."
