Here is my reflection:\n\nI mistakenly assumed that Mahr and Stuckey worked in different sales zones, which led me to choose option A (Kim works in Zone 2). However, the problem states that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, which means that option B (Mahr works in Zone 1) is the correct answer.\n\nTo arrive at the correct answer, I should have carefully read the problem and considered the given information. I should have noticed that Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, which means that only one of them can work in Zone 1. Therefore, the correct answer is option B (Mahr works in Zone 1).\n\nIn the future, I will make sure to carefully read and understand the problem before answering, and I will consider all the given information when solving a problem. I will also use a step-by-step approach to break down complex problems into simpler ones and double-check my calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy."
