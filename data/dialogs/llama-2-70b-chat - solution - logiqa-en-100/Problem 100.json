(1) If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.Bit.(2) If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.(3) If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.(4) Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.(5) P cannot be in the same team as Q.(6) If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.\nQuestion: If H is in Team 2, which of the listed arrangements is acceptable for Team 1?\nChoices:\n  A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N\n  B: Before? G In? K After? N\n  C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G\n  D: Before? G Middle? K After? L\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.\n2. Identify the key elements in the question: the magicians, the teams, and the positions.\n3. Create a mental or physical diagram of the arrangement, using the conditions to guide the placement of each magician.\n4. Check the diagram to ensure that all conditions are satisfied.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the diagram.\n"

Condition (1) requires G or H to be in the front. H is in team 2, so G must be in the front of team 1.\n2. Condition (2) requires K to be in the middle. K must be in the middle of team 2.\n3. Condition (3) requires L to be on team 1. L must be in the back of team 1.\n4. Condition (4) prohibits P and K from being in the same team. P must be in team 2.\n5. Condition (5) prohibits P and Q from being in the same team. Q must be in team 1.\n6. Condition (6) requires Q to be in the middle of team 1 if H is in team 2. This is already satisfied.\n\nNow, let's create a diagram:\n\nTeam 1:\nBefore: L\nMiddle: Q\nAfter: N\n\nTeam 2:\nBefore: G\nMiddle: K\nAfter: H\n\nThe diagram satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is choice A: Before? L Middle? Q After? N.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
