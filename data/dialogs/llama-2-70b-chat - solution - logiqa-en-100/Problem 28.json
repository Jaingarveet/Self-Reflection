One of J or K will participate, but not both.\n3. If J participates, then G participates.\n4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.\nFrom condition 1, either E or F will participate. If E participates, then F cannot participate, and vice versa.\nFrom condition 2, either J or K will participate. If J participates, then K cannot participate, and vice versa.\nFrom condition 3, if J participates, then G must participate.\nFrom condition 4, if F does not participate, then M cannot participate.\nNow, let's consider the choices:\nA: F and H\nIf F participates, then E cannot participate, which violates condition 1. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\nB: G and J\nThis choice meets conditions 1, 2, and 3. However, if J participates, then G must participate, which means M cannot participate, violating condition 4. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\nC: G and M\nThis choice meets conditions 1, 3, and 4. However, it violates condition 2 since both J and K do not participate. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.\nD: H and M\nThis choice meets conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is the only remaining choice that satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is D: H and M.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
