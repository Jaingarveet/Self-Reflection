Each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department. The following conditions must be met:\n\n1. There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.\n2. F and G are not in charge of the same department.\n3. H and I are not in charge of the same department.\n\nWe know that F and M are not in charge of the same department. We can conclude that F is in charge of one department, and M is in charge of another department.\n\nLet's consider all possible combinations:\n\n* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. However, this would violate condition (2), since F and M are not in charge of the same department.\n* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. However, this would violate condition (2), since F and M are not in charge of the same department.\n* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. However, this would violate condition (3), since H and I are not in charge of the same department.\n* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. This possibility satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that option [REDACTED] is correct: [REDACTED]\n"
