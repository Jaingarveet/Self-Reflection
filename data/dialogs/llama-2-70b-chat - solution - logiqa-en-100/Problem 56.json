After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my previous answer was based on incomplete information and misunderstanding of the question.\n\nThe correct answer is choice C: \"It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge. The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\"\n\nThis answer raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view because it highlights that the issue of ship passage is not limited to the Nanjing Bridge, but rather a common problem in multiple locations along the Yangtze River. Therefore, simply demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge would not completely solve the problem of ship passage.\n\nThe other choices do not directly address the issue of the Nanjing Bridge's clear height and its impact on ship passage. Choice A mentions the impact of the Nanjing Bridge on exported goods, but it does not directly relate to the expert's argument. Choice B mentions the mooring of international ships at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, but it does not address the issue of ship passage. Choice D mentions the development of shipbuilding technology, but it does not directly relate to the clear height of the Nanjing Bridge or the other bridges mentioned in choice C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice C, which highlights the limitation of the expert's proposal to address the issue of ship passage in the Yangtze River waterway."
