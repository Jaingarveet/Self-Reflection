After reevaluating the question and choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for \"customized babies\", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\nThe question asks which option, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people who believe that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\" due to the advent of gene sequencing technology.\n\nOption (C) clarifies that gene screening technology is primarily aimed at avoiding reproductive defects, and it also highlights the potential for human eugenics and eugenics. This statement addresses the misconception that \"customized babies\" are a direct result of gene sequencing technology. Instead, it emphasizes that the concept of \"customized babies\" is more closely related to cloning, which is a separate and distinct technology.\n\nTherefore, option (C) provides a more accurate understanding of the relationship between gene sequencing technology and the concept of \"customized babies.\" It refutes the ordinary people's view by clarifying the distinction between the two technologies and their respective applications.\n\nI hope this revised answer better addresses the question, and I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on my previous response."
