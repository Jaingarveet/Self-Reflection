E or F has one person to participate, but not both .One of J or K will participate, but not both.If J participates, then G participates.Unless F participates, M does not participate.\nQuestion: If H does not participate in the game, which of the following two players must be included in the game?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G\n  C: F and K\n  B: E and M\n  D: G and K\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n\n1. If H does not participate in the game, then we can deduce that either E or F must participate.\n2. Since J or K must participate, and H is not participating, J must participate.\n3. Since J participates, G participates.\n4. Since F is not participating, M does not participate.\n5. Therefore, the two players that must be included in the game are [REDACTED].\n"
