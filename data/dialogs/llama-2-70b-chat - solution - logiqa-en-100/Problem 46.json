F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: Which of the following pairs of employees is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department?\nChoices:\n  A: G and I\n  B: G and X\n  C: G and Y\n  D: H and W\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the conditions again:\n\n1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.\n2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nFrom condition 3, we know that X and W cannot be allocated to the same department. Therefore, option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], is not a valid pair for the sales department.\n\nInstead, let's consider option [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. If G is allocated to the sales department, X must be allocated to the production department, according to condition 3. This satisfies all the conditions and is a valid pair for the sales department.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].\n"
