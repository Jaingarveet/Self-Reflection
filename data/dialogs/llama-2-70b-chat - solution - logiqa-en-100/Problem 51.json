F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.\nQuestion: If X and F are assigned to the same department, which of the following statements cannot be true?\nChoices:\n  A: G is assigned to the sales department\n  B: H is assigned to the production department.\n  C: I was assigned to the sales department.\n  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's analyze the conditions again:\n\n1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.\n2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.\n3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.\n4. F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nNow, let's consider all possible allocations:\n\n1. X and F in the public relations department.\n2. X in the sales department, F in the production department.\n3. X in the production department, F in the sales department.\n4. X and F in the sales department.\n\nWe can eliminate option 4 as it violates condition 1.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining options:\n\n1. X and F in the public relations department.\nThis satisfies all conditions.\n2. X in the sales department, F in the production department.\nThis satisfies conditions 1 and 4 but violates condition 2.\n3. X in the production department, F in the sales department.\nThis satisfies conditions 1 and 4 but violates condition 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option 1: X and F in the public relations department.\n"
