The correct answer is (A) Before deciding whether to steal something from someone else, a person can know exactly how long he can live.\n\nThe argument relies on the assumption that a person's lifespan determines whether it is beneficial for them to steal from others. The argument states that if a person only lived for one day, it would be best for them to steal because they would not suffer the fear of being caught. However, if a person can still live for 20 years, it is not beneficial for them to steal because they will suffer the fear of being caught. This implies that the person's lifespan is known before they make the decision to steal. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there is any further information I can provide to support my answer."
