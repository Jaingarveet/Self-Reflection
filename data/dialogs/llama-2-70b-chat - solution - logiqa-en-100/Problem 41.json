The correct answer is choice B: In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.\n\nThe statement \"If the above statement is true, which of the following statements must be true?\" implies that we need to find a statement that logically follows from the given statement. The given statement says that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy, and that if it can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.\n\nFrom this information, we can infer that if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will definitely avoid bankruptcy, since it has already achieved the goal of increasing productivity by 10%. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.\n\nMy previous mistake was that I misunderstood the question and thought that the correct answer was choice A. I realized that choice A is actually a separate statement that is not necessarily true, and it is not the answer to the question.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
