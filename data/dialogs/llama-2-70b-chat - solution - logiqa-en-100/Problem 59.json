I chose answer A, thinking that it met all the conditions. However, upon reflection, I realized that I had missed condition 3, which states that if X is allocated to the sales department, W must be allocated to the production department.\n\nTherefore, I went back and re-read the conditions carefully and analyzed each answer choice. I realized that answer C meets all the conditions. X is allocated to the public relations department, which means W must be allocated to the production department. F and G cannot be allocated to the same department, so F must be allocated to the production department, and G must be allocated to the sales department. H and Y must be allocated to the same department, so they can be allocated to the sales department. I can be allocated to either the sales department or the production department, but since F is already allocated to the production department, I must be allocated to the sales department.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, Y, W.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me answer the question correctly this time!"
