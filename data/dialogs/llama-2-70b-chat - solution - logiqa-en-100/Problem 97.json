The correct answer is B: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years.\n\nThe argument claims that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating based on the increase in certain types of posts on an online forum. However, if the number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, it's possible that the increase in posts about social issues is simply a result of a larger user base, rather than a deterioration in the social atmosphere. This would weaken the argument, as it suggests that the increase in posts about social issues may not be as significant as initially thought.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years."
