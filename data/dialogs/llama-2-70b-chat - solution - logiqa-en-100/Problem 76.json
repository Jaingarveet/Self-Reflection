The correct answer is (B) Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity.\n\nThe argument \"Taiwanese are not Chinese\" is based on the premise that all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China. However, this argument is not valid because it is based on a false premise. The fact that Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China does not necessarily mean that they are not Chinese.\n\nSimilarly, the argument \"Air is not a commodity\" is based on the premise that commodities have use value, and air does not have use value. However, this argument is not valid because it is based on a false premise. Air does have use value, as it is essential for human survival. Therefore, air can be considered a commodity.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is (B) Commodities have use value, and air certainly has use value, so air is of course a commodity. This answer clearly shows that the argument \"Taiwanese are not Chinese\" is not valid, as it is based on a false premise."
