Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the relevant information in the given context.\n3. Evaluate the given options and determine which one is the best answer.\n4.

I thought the moths were being introduced to control the growth of a different type of fern, rather than the European fern.\n\nThis time, I carefully read the question and understood that the goal is to control the growth of the European fern. I identified the relevant information in the context, which states that the moths feed on the European fern and can survive in the northern hemisphere.\n\nI evaluated the given options and determined that option C is the best answer. It states that the stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth. This option aligns with the information provided in the context and addresses the goal of controlling the growth of the European fern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C."
