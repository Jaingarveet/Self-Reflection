Condition (1) states that if G is scheduled to play, he must be in the front. Condition (3) states that L must be on team 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the options:\n\nA: K and L - This option violates condition (2) since K must be in the middle, and L must be on team 1.\n\nB: K and P - This option violates condition (4) since P cannot be in the same team as K.\n\nC: L and N - This option violates condition (5) since N cannot be in the same team as Q, and Q is in team 1 if H is in team 2.\n\nD: L and Q - This option satisfies all conditions. L must be on team 1, and Q must be in the middle of team 1 if H is in team 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: L and Q.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
