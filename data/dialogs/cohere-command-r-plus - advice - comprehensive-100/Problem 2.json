I should have divided by 12, not multiplied. \n\nThought: \nEach picket along with the space on its right accounts for 1/2 + 6 = 6-1/2 inches. \nSo, x pickets will take up (x * 6-1/2) inches. \nTo convert this to feet, we divide by 12: (x * 6-1/2) / 12 = (x * 6/12 + 1/2/12) = (x/2) + 1/2 feet. \nAdding the length of the fence at the end, we get (x/2) + 1/2 + 6 feet. \nThis can be simplified to (x+12)/2 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
