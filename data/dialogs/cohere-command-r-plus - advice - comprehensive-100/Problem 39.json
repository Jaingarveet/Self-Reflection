        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to keywords and qualifiers in the question and options, such as \"some,\" \"all,\" \"always,\" or \"never.\" These words can significantly impact the scope and nature of the conclusion.\n- Analyze the provided statements to identify specific commonalities or differences between the described categories.\n- Avoid making broad generalizations or inferences beyond the scope of the provided information. Stick to the specific details given.\n- Remember that the correct answer may not be the most appealing or interesting option; it should be the one that is most strongly supported by the provided statements.\n"

Choice E is the correct answer.\n\nThe remaining choices are false or cannot be determined from the information given:\n- Choice A is false as not all beasts are violations of natural law (only those that symbolize a psychological disturbance).\n- Choice B is false as we don't know if stories that violate natural laws but don't involve monsters or science invoke dread.\n- Choice C is false as we don't know if all horror stories involve psychologically disturbed characters, only that some beast stories do.\n- Choice D is false as we don't know if most authors of mad scientist stories are antiscience; they could just be expressing that science alone isn't enough.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
