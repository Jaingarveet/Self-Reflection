        "content": "Reflection: I made a calculation error in my previous attempt. I added the difference in averages to the initial average weight, instead of subtracting, to find the weight of the new truck. Correcting this error should lead to the right answer.\n\nThought: \nThe problem involves finding the weight of the new heavy-duty truck added to a group of vehicles, given changes in their average weight. \n\nStep 1: Understanding the Given Information\n\nInitial average weight of 10 vehicles = 12.2 tons\n\nFinal average weight after adding the new truck = 12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons\n\nStep 2: Calculating the Weight of the New Truck\n\nThe weight of the new truck can be calculated by considering the increase in total weight when it is added to the group. \n\nLet the weight of the new truck be 'x' tons. \n\nTotal weight of the original 10 vehicles = 10 * 12.2 tons = 122 tons\n\nAfter adding the new truck, the total weight becomes (122 tons + x). This total weight should correspond to the final average weight multiplied by the total number of vehicles (now 11): \n\n(Final average weight) * (Total number of vehicles) = 14.8 tons * 11 = 162.8 tons\n\nSo, we have: \n122 tons + x = 162.8 tons \n\nSolving for x, we get: \nx = 162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons \n\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons. \n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
