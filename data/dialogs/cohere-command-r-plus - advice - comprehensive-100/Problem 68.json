I incorrectly assumed that the line passing through the origin meant the line intersected the origin, rather than containing the origin as one of its points. This led to an incorrect calculation for the slope. To find the correct answer, I should set the slope of the line to the slope of a line that passes through the origin, which is 0.\n\nThought: \nThe line passing through the points (2, k) and (k, 32) has a slope of (32-k)/(k-2).\nFor the line to pass through the origin (0, 0), the slope must be 0.\nSetting the slope to 0 and solving for k, I get k = 16.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
