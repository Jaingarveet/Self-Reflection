I should have paid closer attention to the specific conditions and their implications. The correct approach is to systematically go through each statement and deduce the characteristics of each man.\n\nThought: \nLet's go through the statements one by one to deduce the characteristics of each man:\n\n(1) Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome. This tells us that there can be different combinations of traits among them.\n\n(2) Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors. Now we know that Wang Wei and Wu Gang have one trait each.\n\n(3) Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height. This means that one of them must be tall since there are 3 tall men in total. Let's assume Liu Dawei is tall.\n\n(4) Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall, which means one of them might be tall, but not both. As we assumed Liu Dawei is tall, Li Qiang cannot be tall based on statement (3).\n\nNow, we know that Liu Dawei is tall. Since there are 3 tall men, Wu Gang and Wang Wei must also be tall. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are doctors, so they fulfill two traits each. Finally, only one man is handsome, and it hasn't been assigned to anyone yet, so it must be Li Qiang since the other three already have two traits each.\n\nTherefore, Li Qiang is the only one who meets all the requirements of being tall, handsome, and a doctor.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
