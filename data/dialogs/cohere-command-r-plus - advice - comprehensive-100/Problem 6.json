However, the question states that U is the midpoint of ST, not RS. By correcting this interpretation and applying the correct midpoint calculation, we can find the correct answer.\n\nThought: \nLet's denote the distance between R and U as x.\nSince U is the midpoint of ST, the distance between R and U is half of RT, which is 17/2 = 8.5.\nTherefore, the length of RU is 8.5 units.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
