However, upon reflection, the correct answer, Answer \"D\", provides an alternative and compelling explanation for the soaring housing prices, directly contradicting the assertion. It shifts the focus from land prices to the imbalance between supply and demand, suggesting that other factors beyond land prices are primarily responsible for the issue. This alternative explanation effectively weakens the argument that links soaring housing prices primarily to rising land prices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
