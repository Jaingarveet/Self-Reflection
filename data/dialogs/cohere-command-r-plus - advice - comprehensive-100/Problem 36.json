Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that .\nQuestion: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument?\nChoices:\n  A: in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible\n  B: students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject\n  C: educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods\n  D: teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students\n  E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Understand analogies by identifying the underlying relationships and parallels. \n- Look for keywords and phrases that indicate emphasis, such as \"since,\" \"most important,\" and \"above all.\" \n- Ensure that your interpretation of the analogy aligns with the specific relationship being drawn. \n- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that go beyond the scope of the analogy. \n- Always choose the answer option that best completes the argument's logical progression.\n"
