I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Thought:**\n* Hypophosphatemic Vitamin D Resistant Rickets (HVDRR) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypophosphatemia (low blood phosphate levels) and resistance to vitamin D.\n* The inheritance pattern of HVDRR is X-linked dominant. This means that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disorder.\n* Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Therefore, females are more likely to be carriers of the HVDRR gene, while males are more likely to be affected by the disorder.\n**Action:** Answer(\"D\")"
