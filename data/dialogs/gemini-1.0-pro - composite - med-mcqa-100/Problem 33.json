I will try my best to answer the question correctly this time.\n**Thought:**\n* Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes.\n* The salt-split skin technique is a diagnostic test used to identify the presence of autoantibodies in the skin.\n* The epidermal side of the salt-split skin technique is the side that contains the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of the skin.\n* IgG is a type of antibody that is involved in the immune response.\n**Analysis:**\n* Option A, XVII collagen, is not a known antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid.\n* Option B, Epiligrin, is a known antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid, but it is not bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt-split skin technique.\n* Option C, Laminin 5, is a known antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid and is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt-split skin technique.\n* Option D, BP antigen 1 & 2, are known antigens in bullous pemphigoid, but not in cicatricial pemphigoid.\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct answer is **C: Laminin 5**.\n**Action:**\nAnswer(\"C\")"
