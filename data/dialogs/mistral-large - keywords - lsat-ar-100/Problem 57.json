Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

However, the condition states that this is only true if Nina's report is not on Wednesday.\n\nThought:\nIf Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. However, George must also give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible either. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday. If Kyle also gives a report on Wednesday, then this would satisfy the condition that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
