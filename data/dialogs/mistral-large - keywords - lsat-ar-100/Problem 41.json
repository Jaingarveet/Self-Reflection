Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.\nQuestion: If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Reynaldo tests H on the first day.\n  B: Reynaldo tests J on the first day.\n  C: Theresa tests H on the second day.\n  D: Theresa tests J on the first day.\n  E: Yuki tests H on the second day.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Misinterpretation of conditions\n - Incorrect inference\n"

However, since Yuki must test Seamus' first-day bicycle on the second day, and Seamus cannot test H on the first day (because Theresa must test H on the first day), Yuki cannot test H on the second day. I also made a logical reasoning error by not considering that Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test J on the first day. I misinterpreted the conditions and made an incorrect inference about which bicycles Yuki and Reynaldo could test on the first day."
