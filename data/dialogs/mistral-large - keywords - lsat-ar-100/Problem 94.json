Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: If the veterinarian is in space 5, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The optometrist is in space 2.\n  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.\n  C: A restaurant is in space 4.\n  D: The shoe store is in space 6.\n  E: The toy store is in space 3.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Incomplete analysis\n- Incorrect assumption\n"

I incorrectly assumed that the pharmacy must be in space 1 since the veterinarian is in space 5 and the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. However, I failed to consider that the pharmacy could also be in space 7 and the optometrist in space 6.\n\nThought:\nSince the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the possible locations for the pharmacy are spaces 1 and 7.\n\nIf the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7. However, this would mean that the veterinarian (in space 5) is not next to the pharmacy, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.\n\nTherefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. This means that the restaurant must be in space 1. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the other restaurant cannot be in spaces 2 or 3. Therefore, it must be in space 4.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
