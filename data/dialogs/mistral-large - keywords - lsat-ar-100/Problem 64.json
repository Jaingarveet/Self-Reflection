Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Distribution error\n"

However, since Udall is in Zone 3, Tiao cannot be in Zone 2. This led to a logical reasoning error, as I concluded that Parra and Quinn could be in Zone 2, which is incorrect. Additionally, I made a distribution error by not considering that there must be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. By correcting these errors, I arrived at the correct answer."
