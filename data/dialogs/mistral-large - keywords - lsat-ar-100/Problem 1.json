Franco is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. This is possible since Garcia cannot testify on Monday (because Franco is there) and Hong cannot testify on Monday either.\n2. Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe. This is not possible since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.\n3. Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday. This is possible since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and neither Franco nor Iturbe can testify on Tuesday (Franco cannot testify with Garcia and Iturbe testifies on Wednesday).\n4. Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday. This is not possible since at least one witness must testify on Monday and Hong cannot testify on Monday.\n5. Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday. This is not possible since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday and at least one witness must testify on Monday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously misinterpreted the conditions and made a reading comprehension error. I misunderstood that Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, not just on Monday. I also misunderstood that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, not at least two. I will be more careful in interpreting the conditions and reading the question in the future."
