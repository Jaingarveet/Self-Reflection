Since at least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, F cannot be performed first or second. Since O is performed either first or fifth, and O is performed immediately after T, T cannot be performed first, so O must be performed first. Since P must be performed at some time before S, and at least one composition must be performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, S cannot be performed second. Since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, and O is performed first, L and H cannot be performed first, so they must be performed last. Since P must be performed at some time before S, and S cannot be performed second, P must be performed second. Since F cannot be performed first or second, and O is performed first, F must be performed either third or later. Since at least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and O is performed first, F cannot be performed third, so F must be performed either fourth or later.
