I also made a logical reasoning error by not considering that exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, which means that Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday since they cannot testify on Wednesday (Iturbe is already scheduled) and Franco cannot testify on Monday (since Garcia must testify on Monday to avoid testifying on the same day as Franco).\n\nThought:\nSince Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Garcia must testify on Monday to avoid testifying on the same day as Franco. Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday. Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
