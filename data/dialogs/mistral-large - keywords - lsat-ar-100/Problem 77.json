Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Analysis error\n - Incomplete analysis\n - Insufficient consideration of rules\n"

Additionally, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nSince Robertson can only be assigned one of four parking spaces, and must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of three possible spaces (#1, #2, or #3). Similarly, since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of two possible spaces (#1 or #2).\n\nThe rules do not limit the possible spaces for Souza, Vaughn, or Xu to only two possible spaces.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nSelf-reflection:\nIn my previous answer, I made a logical reasoning error by not considering all of the rules and their implications. I also made an analysis error by not fully considering the limitations placed on each employee's possible parking spaces. In the future, I will make sure to carefully consider all of the rules and their implications, and to fully analyze the limitations placed on each employee's possible parking spaces."
