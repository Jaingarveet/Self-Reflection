However, this is not necessarily true. Megregian could review only two plays, and Kramer and Lopez could each review only one.\n\nThought:\nSince exactly three of the students review Undulation, and neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must be one of the students who review Undulation. This means that either Kramer or O'Neill must also review Undulation, since they both review Tamerlane and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\n\nIf O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Megregian cannot review Tamerlane, since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Jiang reviews Undulation. This means that Megregian must review Sunset, and Kramer must review Undulation. However, this would mean that Kramer reviews two plays, which contradicts the condition that Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian.\n\nTherefore, O'Neill cannot review Undulation, and Kramer must review Undulation. This means that Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset, and Lopez must review Sunset.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
