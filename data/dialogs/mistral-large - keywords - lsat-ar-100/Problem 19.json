Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Monday.\n  B: Irving gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\n  D: Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\n  E: Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Reading comprehension error\n - Logical reasoning error\n - Misinterpretation of conditions\n"

However, the condition states that this is only true if Nina's report is not on Wednesday.\n\nThought:\nSince Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, and George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday. This means that Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday, as he is giving a morning report and George is giving the afternoon report.\n\nSince Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, and George is giving an afternoon report on Tuesday, the only remaining options for afternoon reports are Irving and Nina.\n\nIf Nina gives an afternoon report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. However, this is not possible, as Helen is giving a morning report and George is giving an afternoon report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give an afternoon report on Monday.\n\nIf Nina gives an afternoon report on Wednesday, then there is no conflict with Helen and Irving giving reports on the next day, as there are no more days left. However, this would mean that Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday, as he is the only remaining option for afternoon reports.\n\nTherefore, Irving must give a report on Monday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
