Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect assumption\n - Incomplete information\n - Logical reasoning error\n"

I also did not consider all the given conditions, resulting in incomplete information.\n\nThought:\nLet's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:\n\n1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.\n4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.\n5. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n\nFrom conditions 1 and 3, we can deduce that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must also be in Zone 1. However, this would mean that there is no space left for Tiao in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn must be in a different zone together.\n\nNow, since Tiao is in Zone 1, Udall cannot be in Zone 2 (condition 2). This means that Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3 together.\n\nSince there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and we already have Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, there must be at least one more representative in Zone 3. The only remaining pair is Parra and Quinn, so they must also be in Zone 3.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
