However, the information provided does not state that they only review Tamerlane.\n\nThought:\nSince Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review all three plays. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review Sunset. Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot both review Sunset.
