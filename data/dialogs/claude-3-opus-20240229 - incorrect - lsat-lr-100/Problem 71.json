        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The museum only displays 20th century works, either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.\n2. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store. \n3. The museum store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.\n4. Since Nighthawks is used as an example of a work not in the permanent collection but available as a print, we can infer it is a 20th century work (to be consistent with the museum's focus).\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA is incorrect because Nighthawks is an example of a print sold that is not on loan or in the permanent collection.\nB looks correct. The museum only focuses on 20th century works, and Nighthawks is cited as an example print available, implying it is a 20th century work even though not part of the museum's collection. \nC is incorrect because not all displayed works have prints available, only permanent collection works do.\nD is incorrect because we can't conclude Nighthawks is on loan to the museum, only that a print is sold in the store.\nE is likely true that Nighthawks is not displayed, but not a required inference from the information given.\nTherefore, B is the best answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
