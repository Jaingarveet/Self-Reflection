        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe argument concludes that crying must reduce emotional stress because tears contain stress hormones, so shedding tears removes these hormones from the body.\nA) This is a strong point. Even if crying removes stress hormones, the stress reduction could be due to something else about crying, not the removal of the hormones specifically. \nB) The argument does assume that the mere presence of stress hormones in tears is sufficient to conclude that shedding tears reduces stress. But it hasn't established that this is the only requirement, or a sufficient cause on its own.\nC) The argument is not concerned with whether stress also causes crying. This is not the main flaw.\nD) The argument does not mention any other factors working jointly with the stress hormones in tears. This is not the key issue.\nE) This accurately captures the flaw. The argument jumps from the mere presence of stress hormones in tears to the conclusion that shedding tears must therefore reduce stress. But it hasn't ruled out that this is just a side effect, not the cause of stress reduction.\nTherefore, E seems to be the best answer. The argument assumes that because stress hormones are present in tears, the shedding of tears must be what causes a reduction in stress. But it hasn't properly established this causal link.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
