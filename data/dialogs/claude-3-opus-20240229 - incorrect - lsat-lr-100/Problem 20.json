However, he claims he was confused about whether national or local codes applied. \n3. The judge says this excuse might work if he was charged with violating local codes, but not for national codes.\n4. The judge is essentially saying that confusion between the two codes is not an acceptable excuse for violating the national code.\n5. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) Whether the codes overlap is not directly relevant to the judge's reasoning.\nB) The relative strictness of the codes is not mentioned by the judge.\nC) What the local codes require is not the key issue, but rather that violating the national code is unacceptable regardless.\nD) This directly captures the judge's point - that confusion between the two codes does not excuse violating the national one.\nE) While true, this principle is too broad and doesn't specifically justify the judge's reasoning about confusion between the codes.\nTherefore, the principle that best justifies the judge's reasoning is D - ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
