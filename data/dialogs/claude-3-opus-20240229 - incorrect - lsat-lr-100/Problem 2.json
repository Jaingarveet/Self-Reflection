This year, most (but not necessarily all) of the prize-winning films at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nFrom these facts, we can deduce:\nA. We don't know if most Canadian films shown at international festivals won at Lac Nichoutec. The information only tells us about films that won at Lac Nichoutec, not all Canadian films at international festivals. \nB. We have no information about what proportion of Canadian films were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nC. If most Lac Nichoutec winners also won at international festivals, then at least some prize winners at international festivals must have been Canadian. This logically follows from the given information.\nD. The information allows for the possibility that some Lac Nichoutec winners did not win at international festivals. But it doesn't require this to be true.\nE. The information allows for the possibility that all international prize winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec. But it doesn't require some international winners to not be shown.\nTherefore, C is the only statement that must be true based on the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
