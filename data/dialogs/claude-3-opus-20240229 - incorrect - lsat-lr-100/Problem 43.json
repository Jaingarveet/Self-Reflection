        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The ethicist argues that if \"love\" in marital vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love \"until death do us part\" makes no sense. This is because feelings are not within one's control.\n2. The ethicist then concludes that no one should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings. \n3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated assumption. Let's look at each answer choice:\nA) This is too broad. The argument doesn't require that none of our feelings are within our control, just that love (as a feeling) is not.\nB) This is promising, as it directly supports the idea that one shouldn't promise what one can't control. But let's check the other options.\nC) This could work as an assumption, but it's not necessary for the conclusion. Even if love can refer to something else, that doesn't mean it should in this context.\nD) This looks correct. If we assume promises shouldn't be interpreted to make no sense, and interpreting \"love\" as a feeling makes the promise nonsensical, then we should not interpret \"love\" as a feeling in this promise.\nE) This is similar to D, but a bit stronger. A promise could make sense even if it can't be kept (e.g., \"I promise to try my best\").\n4. Therefore, the best answer is D. The ethicist's conclusion relies on the assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
