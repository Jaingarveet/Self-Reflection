I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-Reflection:**\n* **Error:** I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting \"A: Infection\" as the major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst.\n* **Reason for Error:** I did not consider the full range of potential complications and focused only on the most common one.\n* **Solution:** I will carefully analyze all the answer choices and consider the specific context of the question.\n**Answer:**\nBased on my self-reflection and a thorough analysis of the answer choices, I believe the correct answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")**\n**Explanation:**\n* **Fistula:** A fistula is an abnormal connection between two organs or vessels. In the case of cyst-gastrostomy, a fistula can develop between the pancreatic cyst and the stomach, leading to leakage of pancreatic fluid and potentially serious complications.\n* **Infection:** While infection is a potential complication of any surgery, it is not the most common or severe complication in this specific case.\n* **Obstruction:** Obstruction is less likely than fistula in this context.\n* **Hemorrhage:** Hemorrhage is a serious complication, but it is less common than fistula in cyst-gastrostomy.\nTherefore, based on the specific context of the question and the potential complications of cyst-gastrostomy, the most likely major complication is a fistula."
