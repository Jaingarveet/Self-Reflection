I have since learned that Mifepristone is not commonly used in PPH treatment, while Misoprostol, Oxytocin, and Ergotamine are.\nThought:\nPPH (Postpartum Hemorrhage) is a serious complication of childbirth that can lead to significant blood loss and even death.\nErgotamine is a vasoconstrictor that is used to treat migraines and other vascular headaches. It is not commonly used in PPH treatment because it can cause uterine contractions, which can worsen the bleeding.\nMifepristone is a medication that is used to terminate pregnancies. It is not commonly used in PPH treatment because it can also cause uterine contractions.\nMisoprostol is a medication that is used to induce labor and to treat postpartum hemorrhage. It is a prostaglandin that causes the uterus to contract.\nOxytocin is a hormone that is produced by the body during labor and breastfeeding. It causes the uterus to contract and can be used to treat postpartum hemorrhage.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
