This was incorrect because topical antibiotics are not the first-line treatment for comedonal acne.\nI have learned from my mistake and will use the following steps to answer this question correctly:\n1. Identify the type of acne: Comedonal acne is characterized by the presence of comedones, which are blackheads and whiteheads.\n2. Consider the patient's situation: The patient is about to marry, which may be a stressful time that could exacerbate her acne.\n3. Choose the most appropriate treatment: Based on the type of acne and the patient's situation, the most appropriate treatment is a combination of topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
