(1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent; (2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department; (3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department.\nQuestion: If the Human Resources Department is not at the upper level of the Administration Department, which of the following may be correct?\nChoices:\n  A: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department\n  B: The sales department is one level above the administrative department\n  C: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department\n  D: Sales Department is on the second floor\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Draw a visual representation of the building with six floors and label the departments. \n2. Use the known information to rule out impossible arrangements. \n3. Identify the constraints and their implications on the relative positions of the departments. \n4. Consider the statement: \"HR is not above Administration.\" Interpret this as HR being either below or not directly above Administration. \n5. Apply this new constraint to the remaining possibilities from step 4. \n6. Choose the answer that aligns with the conclusion.\n"
