Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles by multiplying the average weight by the number of vehicles.\n2. Calculate the new average weight by adding the given increase to the original average.\n3.

        "content": "Reflection: I made an error in my previous attempt; I added the increase in weight to the original total weight, rather than considering the new average weight. This led me to choose an answer that was too high. To find the correct solution, I must calculate the new average weight and then determine the total weight of the group, including the new truck.\n\nThought: \nFirst, we calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles: \n10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons\n\nNow, we find the new average weight: \nOriginal average weight + Increase = New average weight\n12.2 tons + 2.6 tons = 14.8 tons\n\nWith the new vehicle, there are 11 vehicles in total. So, the total weight of the new group is: \n14.8 tons/vehicle * 11 vehicles = 162.8 tons\n\nFinally, we can find the weight of the new heavy-duty truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight: \n162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons\n\nSo, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 40.8 tons.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
