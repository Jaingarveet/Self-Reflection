Understand the argument: Rising land prices are claimed to be the main driver of soaring housing prices. \n2. Identify the goal: We are looking for an option that casts the most doubt on this assertion. \n3. Evaluate each choice: \n    - [REDACTED]: Shows a discrepancy between housing and land price increases but does not directly refute the assertion. \n    - [REDACTED]: Presents a scenario where housing prices rise while land prices remain almost unchanged, directly contradicting the assertion. \n    - [REDACTED]: Supports the assertion by stating that increasing land costs lead to higher house prices. \n    - [REDACTED]: Offers an alternative explanation for soaring housing prices but does not address land prices. \n4. Select the most effective option: Choice [REDACTED] directly contradicts the assertion and is the most doubtful of the argument.\n"
