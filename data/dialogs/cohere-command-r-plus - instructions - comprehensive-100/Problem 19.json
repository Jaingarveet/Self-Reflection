Identify the logical fallacy in the original argument. \n2. Understand that the conclusion (\"friends are like dung\") is not valid. \n3. Recognize that the truth or falsehood of individual statements ([REDACTED] and D) does not address the fallacy. \n4. Focus on the conditional relationship between \"friends\" and \"money\" ([REDACTED] and C). \n5. Choose the option that refutes the fallacy by establishing a contradictory relationship between friends and money (B).\n"

The key to this question is understanding the logical relationship between the statements and the fallacy inherent in the argument.\n\nThought: \nThe original argument commits the fallacy of equivocation by equating \"worth\" in two different senses: the value of money and the value of friends. To refute the fallacy, we need to establish a contradictory relationship between friends and money.\n\nChoice B states, \"If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.\" This statement sets up a contradictory relationship between the value of friends and the value of money. If friends are truly valuable, then money cannot be equated with dung. This choice breaks the fallacy by showing that the two statements are not equivalent in meaning.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
