Understand the problem: Interpret the question correctly. Realize that the line passing through the origin means one of the given points must have a coordinate equal to zero. \n2. Check each given option: For each provided value of $k$, determine if it results in one of the points having a coordinate equal to zero. \n3. Choose the correct answer: Select the option that satisfies the condition for the line to pass through the origin.\n"
