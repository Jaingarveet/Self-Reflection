To get the correct answer, I need to properly substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation to find the possible values of $c$.\n\nThought: \nExpanding the left side of the equation, we get $abx^2+7ax+2bx+14=15x^2+cx+14$.\nMatching coefficients, we get:\n$ab = 15$\n$7a+2b = c$\n$a+b = 8$\n\nSolving the system of equations, we find $a=3, b=5$ or $a=5, b=3$.\n\nPlugging these values into $7a$, we get $c=35$ when $a=5$ and $c=21$ when $a=3$.\n\nTherefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 21 and 35.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
