[step] An empty water bottle or liter of soda will work. You can use any size bottle, but keep in mind that the bigger the bottle, the bigger the gravity bong hits will be.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] If you are using an empty bottle, ensure that the nozzle is clean and dry before you use it. If you're using an empty bottle, use a zip lock or a sheet of tin foil.\n  B: [title] Cut a slit and feed all of the plastic in the slit into the bottle. [step] Make sure that you cut tight enough to keep the plastic in place if you're using an empty bottle.\n  C: [substeps] If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people.\n  D: [title] Put on rubber gloves to avoid snapping the plastic skin of the bottle. [step] This won't break the bottle.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the general idea of preparing a bottle without considering the specific context of a gravity bong. Option A, while related to bottle preparation, doesn't directly address the size issue introduced in the prompt.\n**Error Keywords:**\n*   Contextual Misinterpretation \n*   Ignoring Specific Clues\n*   Focusing on General Concepts\n## Step-by-Step Solution\n1.  **Analyze the Prompt:** The text discusses choosing a bottle size for a gravity bong, implying the next step would involve size considerations.\n2.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   Option A discusses cleaning and sealing, which is not directly related to size.\n    *   Option B talks about cutting and feeding plastic, unrelated to the current context.\n    *   Option C directly addresses the size issue by suggesting appropriate bottle sizes for individual or group use.\n    *   Option D introduces irrelevant information about rubber gloves and snapping plastic.\n3.  **Choose the Best Option:** Option C logically follows the prompt by providing size recommendations based on the number of users. \n## Instructions for Future Similar Problems\n1.  **Identify the Topic and Context:** Clearly understand the subject matter and the specific situation being discussed.\n2.  **Analyze the Prompt and its Clues:** Pay close attention to the information provided and identify any hints about the next step.\n3.  **Evaluate Options Based on Relevance and Logic:** Choose the option that directly relates to the prompt and logically follows the established context.\n4.  **Avoid Generalizations and Assumptions:** Don't rely on broad assumptions or general knowledge; focus on the specific details of the problem.\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n*   **Read Carefully and Thoroughly:** Ensure complete understanding of the problem before attempting to solve it.\n*   **Focus on Specific Details and Context:** Pay attention to the nuances of the situation and avoid making generalizations.\n*   **Think Step-by-Step:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n*   **Consider Multiple Perspectives:** Try to see the problem from different angles to broaden your understanding.\n*   **Learn from Mistakes:** Analyze incorrect answers to identify areas for improvement and avoid repeating errors.\n"
