After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my mistake was due to a misunderstanding of the conditions and an incorrect application of logic.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) G and Y.\n\nThe reason for this is that, according to condition (2), F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. Therefore, if G is allocated in the sales department, F must be allocated in a different department, which means that Y, who must be allocated in the same department as H, cannot be allocated in the sales department.\n\nTherefore, the pair of employees unlikely to be assigned to the sales department is G and Y.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
