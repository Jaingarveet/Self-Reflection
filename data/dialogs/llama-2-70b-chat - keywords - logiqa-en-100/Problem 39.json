After reevaluating the question, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect.\nThe correct answer is option C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.\n\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Since No.1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls, it must be the case that No.1 is not type B, as type B robots can recognize shapes but not colors.\n2. Since No.2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls, it must be the case that No.2 is not type A, as type A robots can recognize colors but not shapes.\n3. Therefore, No.1 must be type A, and No.2 must be type B.\n\nI avoided making assumptions and used logical reasoning to arrive at my conclusion. I carefully analyzed the given information and used the process of elimination to deduce the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
