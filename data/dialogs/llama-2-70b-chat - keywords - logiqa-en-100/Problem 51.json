I overlooked the possibility that X and F could be assigned to the sales department.\nAssuming X and F are assigned to the sales department, we know that H and Y must be assigned to the same department, and F and G cannot be assigned to the same department.\nCondition (3) states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. Therefore, W cannot be assigned to the public relations department.\nCondition (4) states that F must be allocated in the production department.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n\nA: G is assigned to the sales department.\nSince X and F are already in the sales department, G cannot be assigned to the sales department, or there would be four employees in the sales department, violating the condition that only three employees can be assigned to each department. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\nB: H is assigned to the production department.\nThis statement is true. H and Y must be assigned to the same department, and since F is already in the production department, H can be assigned to the production department.\n\nC: I was assigned to the sales department.\nThis statement is false. With X and F already in the sales department, there is only one spot left in the sales department, which must be filled by G. Therefore, I cannot be assigned to the sales department.\n\nD: W is assigned to the public relations department.\nThis statement is false. Condition (3) states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. Therefore, W cannot be assigned to the public relations department.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A: G is assigned to the sales department.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
