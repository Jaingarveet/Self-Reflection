The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.\n\nThis answer raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view because it suggests that even if the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge were to be demolished and rebuilt, it would not solve the problem of large ships being unable to pass through the Yangtze River waterway. This is because the other bridges along the river also have a clear height of 24 meters, which would still pose a restriction for large ships. Therefore, the expert's assertion that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt may not be the most effective solution to the problem.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
