The correct answer is (D) The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation.\n\nThe argument that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad is not supported by the information provided. The report only states that the transaction volume of mainland Chinese buyers in US real estate has increased, but it does not provide any information about the number of Chinese buyers or their wealth.\n\nOption (D) is the best argument against the above argument because it highlights a factor that could be contributing to the increased transaction volume of Chinese buyers in US real estate, namely the low risk of the US real estate market. If the US real estate market has a low risk of value depreciation and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation, it would make sense that Chinese buyers would be interested in investing in it, regardless of whether there are more or fewer rich people in China.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation."
