This violates the first condition since both E and F are selected.\n* Choice C: G and M. This violates the fourth condition since M is selected, but F does not participate.\n* Choice B: G and J. This satisfies all conditions:\n\t+ E or F: G (not E or F)\n\t+ One of J or K: J\n\t+ If J participates, then G participates: G\n\t+ Unless F participates, M does not participate: M (not selected)\n* Choice D: H and M. This violates the third condition since G is not selected.\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice B: G and J.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
