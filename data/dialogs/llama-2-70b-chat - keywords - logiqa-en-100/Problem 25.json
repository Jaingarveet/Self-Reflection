Three men are tall, two men are doctors, and one man is handsome.\n2. Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.\n3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.\n4. Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following:\n* Li Qiang is not tall (from point 4).\n* Liu Dawei is not handsome (as there is only one handsome man, and it cannot be Liu Dawei since he is the same height as Li Qiang).\n* Wang Wei is a doctor (from point 2).\n* Wu Gang is a doctor (from point 2).\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\nA. Liu Dawei: He is not handsome (from the above deduction), so he cannot meet all of Li Na's requirements.\nB. Li Qiang: He is not tall (from point 4), so he cannot meet all of Li Na's requirements.\nC. Wu Gang: He is a doctor (from point 2) and tall (from point 1), but we cannot infer that he is handsome.\nD. Wang Wei: He is a doctor (from point 2) and tall (from point 1), and we can infer that he is handsome (as he is not Liu Dawei, who is not handsome).\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Wang Wei.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
