I focused too much on the content of the posts rather than the number of people posting.\n\nThe correct answer, B, weakens the argument by pointing out that the increase in posts related to negative social issues may be due to the fact that there are more people using the internet now, rather than a deterioration of the social atmosphere. This means that the percentage of people posting about these issues may not have changed, or may have even decreased, but the total number of posts has increased due to the larger user base.\n\nTherefore, option B provides a plausible alternative explanation for the observed increase in negative social issues being discussed online, which weakens the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating."
