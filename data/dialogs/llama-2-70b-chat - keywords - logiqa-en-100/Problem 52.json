I mistakenly assumed that the employees held shares in the enterprise, which is not stated in the given context.\n\nThe correct answer is C: If the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest.\n\nThis conclusion logically follows from the given statement. If the cost is high, the profit is low, and if the profit is high, the cost is low. Since the money earned by the employees is a wage that is included in the cost, their interests are aligned with keeping costs low. On the other hand, the money earned by the boss is a profit that is not included in the cost, so their interests are aligned with maximizing profits, even if it means increasing costs. Therefore, if the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, their interests will conflict with those of the boss.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
