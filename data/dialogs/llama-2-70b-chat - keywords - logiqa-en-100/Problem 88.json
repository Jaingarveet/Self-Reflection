Here's my revised answer:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe argument states that Cheng Bian, a super politician, wants to be elected and will do his best to cater to voters. It is impossible to cater to voters without writing many empty checks in many cases. Therefore, it is probable that Cheng Bian wrote many empty checks to voters. The conclusion that best follows from the argument is option C: Cheng Bian probably wrote many empty checks to voters.\n\nReflection:\nIn my previous response, I incorrectly answered option A: Cheng Bian certainly wrote many empty checks to voters. I realized that the argument only suggests that it is probable that Cheng Bian wrote many empty checks, not that he certainly did. Therefore, option C is the best answer."
