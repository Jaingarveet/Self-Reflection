The argument is not about the relationship between loneliness and artistic success, but rather about the relationship between intimate relationships and happiness.\nThe correct answer is B: People with intimate relationships have little time for loneliness.\nThe argument assumes that people who have intimate relationships do not have time to feel lonely, which means that loneliness is not a necessary condition for artistic success. Therefore, the argument challenges the psychological theory that maintaining an intimate relationship is necessary for happiness.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
