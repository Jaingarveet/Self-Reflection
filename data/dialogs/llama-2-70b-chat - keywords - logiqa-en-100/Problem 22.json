I misunderstood the ask and thought it was asking for a reason for the price increase, rather than a reason for the gap between the statistics and people's feelings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Products with a high degree of relevance to people's lives tend to increase prices; those with a low degree of relevance tend to fall prices.\n\nThis answer choice does not help explain the gap between the statistics in the question and the people's feelings because it suggests that the price increase is due to the relevance of the products to people's lives, rather than the actual increase in prices. It does not take into account the fact that people may feel that prices are increasing more than the statistics suggest, even if the products are not particularly relevant to their lives.\n\nThe other answer choices all have some relevance to the question, but choice C is the only one that does not help explain the gap between the statistics and people's feelings.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
