After re-reading the question and the given options, I realized that my previous answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) This country cannot maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.\n\nThe statement explains that a developing country faces a dilemma where it must balance its economic development and social stability. To maintain social stability, the country must establish and improve social security systems, which requires enterprises to pay social insurance premiums for employees. However, paying such premiums reduces the competitiveness of the enterprises, which in turn affects the country's economic development.\n\nTherefore, option (C) is the best answer, as it states that the country cannot maintain both its economic development and social stability. The other options do not accurately reflect the given statement.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and please let me know if there's anything else I can help with."
