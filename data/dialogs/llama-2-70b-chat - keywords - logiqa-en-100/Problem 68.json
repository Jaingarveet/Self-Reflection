I thought the assumption was that a person who knows he won't live long will choose to do something good instead of something bad, so I selected (D) A person who knows that he cannot live for a few days usually chooses to do something good instead of doing something bad.\n\nHowever, upon further review, I realized that the argument actually relies on the assumption that a person can know exactly how long he can live before deciding whether to steal something from someone else. This is stated in choice (A). Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Before deciding whether to steal something from someone else, a person can know exactly how long he can live.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with."
