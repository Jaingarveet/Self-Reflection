It suggests that whatever one desires should be given to others, which is not the message Confucius conveys.\n\nC: Don't treat others unless you want to.\nThis option seems to be the opposite of what Confucius meant. The sentence \"Do not do what you don't want to do to others\" implies that we should treat others the way we want to be treated. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nD: Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.\nThis option is vulnerable to misinterpretation and inference.
