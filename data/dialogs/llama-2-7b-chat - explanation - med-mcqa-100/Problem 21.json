However, Plasmodium quartanum is the species that primarily infects senescent RBCs.\n\nPlasmodium quartanum is a less severe form of malaria that is typically found in areas with temperate climates. It is characterized by a longer incubation period and a lower fever compared to other forms of malaria.\n\nIn contrast, Plasmodium falciparum is the most severe form of malaria and can cause severe anemia, organ failure, and death if left untreated.\n\nI hope this reflection helps me provide the correct answer this time."
