However, upon further reflection, I realized that spring catarrh is actually a type of type I hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nType I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate and occur within minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen. They are characterized by the release of IgE antibodies, which bind to mast cells and trigger the release of histamine and other chemical mediators. This leads to symptoms such as itching, swelling, and inflammation.\n\nIn contrast, type II hypersensitivity reactions are delayed and occur within hours to days after exposure to an allergen. They are characterized by the release of IgG antibodies, which bind to the surface of immune cells and trigger the release of cytokines and other chemical mediators. This leads to symptoms such as swelling, redness, and itching.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) type I hypersensitivity reaction."
