There is no change in voice of the patient. Which of the following nerve is most likely injured during surgery?\nChoices:\n  A: Vagus nerve\n  B: Glossopharyngeal nerve\n  C: SLN nerve\n  D: RLN nerve\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly identified the nerve that was most likely injured during surgery. I thought that the glossopharyngeal nerve was the most likely nerve to be injured, but the correct answer is the superior laryngeal nerve (C).\n\nThe superior laryngeal nerve is responsible for controlling the vocal cords, and the patient's complaints of recurrent aspirations suggest that this nerve may have been injured during the lateral skull base surgery. The glossopharyngeal nerve, on the other hand, is responsible for controlling the tongue and the pharynx, but it is not involved in the control of the vocal cords.\n"
