You are correct, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. Expanisle type osseous metastases are indeed characteristic of primary malignancy of the kidney.\n\nHere's why:\n\nExpanisle type osseous metastases are bone lesions that are typically seen in patients with advanced cancer, particularly in the kidney, lung, and breast. These lesions are characterized by a \"spiky\" or \"expansile\" appearance on imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans.\n\nThe kidney is the most common site of origin for expansile type osseous metastases, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. Other organs, such as the lung and breast, can also produce these types of metastases, but much less frequently.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n\nThank you for correcting me!\n"
