Salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid that is commonly used in chemical peeling to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores. It is also used to treat conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema.\n\nAction: I will answer the question by selecting (D) Salicylic acid as the agent used in chemical peeling that is not listed."
