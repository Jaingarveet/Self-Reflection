This method is used to ensure that the sample is representative of the population and to minimize bias.\n\nIn cluster random sampling, the population is divided into smaller groups or clusters, and then every 10th person is selected from each cluster. This method is useful when the population is spread out over a large area, and it allows researchers to collect data from a representative sample of the population.\n\nIn contrast, simple random sampling involves selecting every 10th person from the population at random, without any consideration of the population's structure or distribution. Statified random sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it involves selecting every 10th person from a list of eligible participants, rather than selecting them at random. Systemic random sampling involves selecting every 10th person from a systematic sample of the population, rather than selecting them at random.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Cluster random sampling."
