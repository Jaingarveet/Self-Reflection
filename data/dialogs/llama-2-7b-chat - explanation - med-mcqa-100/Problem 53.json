I misunderstood the question and provided an incorrect answer. Thank you for pointing it out.\n\nThe correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]. Time-sector scanning of neonates is preferred because it allows for better resolution of the skull and brain structures due to the open fontanelles. The fontanelles are soft spots on the skull of newborns that allow for better imaging of the brain.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* [REDACTED]: The fontanelles are soft spots on the skull of newborns that allow for better imaging of the brain. Time-sector scanning can take advantage of this by imaging the brain through the open fontanelles, providing better resolution than other methods.\n"
