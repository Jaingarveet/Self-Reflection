However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n\n[REDACTED] is a hormone produced by fat cells that plays a key role in regulating energy balance and appetite. [REDACTED] signals to the brain that the body has enough energy stores, which can decrease appetite and increase fat burning. In contrast, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness, but they do not directly affect appetite.\n"

Neuropeptide Y is a hormone produced by the brain that plays a key role in regulating appetite and metabolism. It signals to the brain that the body has enough energy stores, which can decrease appetite and increase fat burning. In contrast, Orexin and Leptin are involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness, but they do not directly affect appetite. Ghrelin is also involved in regulating appetite, but it does not decrease appetite. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Neuropeptide Y."
