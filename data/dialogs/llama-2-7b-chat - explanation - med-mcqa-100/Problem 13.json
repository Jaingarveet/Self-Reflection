[REDA[REDACTED]ED] is the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis in children under 1 year of age, as it is non-invasive and can accurately diagnose the condition. [REDA[REDACTED]ED] (option B) and [REDACTED] (option D) are not suitable for diagnosing pyloric stenosis in young children.\n"

However, upon reflection, I realize that this is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis in children under 1 year of age is ultrasound (option A). This is because ultrasound is non-invasive and can accurately diagnose pyloric stenosis in young children.\n\nReflection:\nI should have considered the age of the patient and the non-invasive nature of ultrasound when making my selection.
