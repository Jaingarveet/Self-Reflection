Alan would like to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. Assuming gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon, which equation can Alan use to determine how many fewer average miles, $m$, he should drive each week?\n\nReflection:\n\n1. Problem and Goal: The problem is to determine the number of fewer miles, $m$, Alan should drive each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\\$ 5$. The goal is to find the correct equation to solve this problem.\n2. Equation: The equation that represents the problem is:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$\n\nThis equation can be derived by using the information provided in the question:\n\n* Alan drives an average of 100 miles each week.\n* His car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.\n* Gasoline costs $\\$ 4$ per gallon.\n\n3. Solution: To solve the equation, we can divide both sides by $\\frac{4}{25}$:\n\n$$m = \\frac{95}{4/25} = 95$$\n\n4. Double-check: To ensure accuracy, we can plug in the value of $m$ into the original equation:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$\n\nSubstituting $m = 95$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{25}{4} \\times 95 = 95$$\n\nWhich is true.\n\n5. Answer: Therefore, the answer is (B) $\\frac{25}{4} m = 5$."
