I need to reevaluate the problem and use the correct conversion factors to find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.\n\nAction:\nI will start by converting 1 decagram to grams, using the conversion factor of 10 grams per decagram.\n\n1 decagram = 10 grams\n\nNext, I will convert 1,000 milligrams to grams, using the conversion factor of 1,000 milligrams per gram.\n\n1,000 milligrams = 1 gram\n\nNow, I will divide the number of grams in one 2-decagram container (20 grams) by the number of grams in one decagram (10 grams) to find the number of decagrams in one 2-decagram container.\n\n20 grams / 10 grams per decagram = 2 decagrams\n\nFinally, I will divide the number of milligrams in one dose (1 milligram) by the number of grams in one decagram (10 grams) to find the number of milligrams in one decagram.\n\n1 milligram / 10 grams per decagram = 0.1 milligrams per decagram\n\nNow, I can use the conversion factor of 10 milligrams per decagram to find the number of 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.\n\n2 decagrams x 10 milligrams per decagram = 20 milligrams\n\nTherefore, there are 20 milligrams in one 2-decagram container.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
