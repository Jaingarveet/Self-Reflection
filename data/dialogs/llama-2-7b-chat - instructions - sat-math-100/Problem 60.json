This means that he will have 3n milliliters of solution left over after giving each student 3 milliliters.\n\nWe also know that he needs 21 milliliters to give each student 4 milliliters of solution. This means that he will have 3n - 21 milliliters of solution left over after giving each student 4 milliliters.\n\nFrom this information, we can set up the equation:\n3n - 21 = 5\n\nSolving for n, we get:\nn = 23\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nI reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I hope this answer is correct."
