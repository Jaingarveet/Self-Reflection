Identify the function $g(x)$ and its formula: The function $g(x)$ is a quadratic function with a formula of $g(x)=a x^{2}+24$.\n2. Plug in -4 into the function $g(x)$: When I plug in -4 into the function $g(x)$, I get $g(-4)=a (-4)^{2}+24$.\n3. Simplify the expression to find the value of $g(-4)$: Simplifying the expression, I get $g(-4)=-a 16+24=0$.\n4.
