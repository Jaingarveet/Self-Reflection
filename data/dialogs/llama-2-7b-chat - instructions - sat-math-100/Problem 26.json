The correct approach is to identify the like terms of the two polynomials and add them together.\n\nLike terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent. In this case, the like terms of the two polynomials are:\n\n$3x^2 - 5x + 2$\n$5x^2 - 2x - 6$\n\nTo add these like terms, we combine them:\n\n$3x^2 - 5x + 2 + 5x^2 - 2x - 6$\n\n= $8x^2 - 7x - 4$\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two polynomials is $8x^2 - 7x - 4$.\n\nAnswer: B"
