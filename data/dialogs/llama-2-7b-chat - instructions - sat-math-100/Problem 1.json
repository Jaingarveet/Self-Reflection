This is a quadratic equation, and the solution is $v = - \\frac{k}{t}$.\n\nNow, I need to find $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$. Let's substitute $v = - \\frac{k}{t}$ into the equation $v = h+k-16 t$.\n\nAction: I will substitute $v = - \\frac{k}{t}$ into the equation $v = h+k-16 t$.\n\nReflection: The equation becomes $-\\frac{k}{t} = h+k-16 t$. Simplifying, we get $k = h+16 t$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B): $v = \\frac{h-k+16}{t}$.\n\nI reflected on my previous incorrect answer and identified the mistake. I substituted the wrong value for $v$ into the equation, which led to an incorrect solution. By carefully analyzing the equation and using the correct value for $v$, I was able to find the correct answer."
