Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belongs to Group Y is 68/100, which is option A.\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI made a mistake in my initial answer by not properly interpreting the problem. I realized that the question was asking for the probability of a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonging to Group Y, rather than the total number of people in Group Y. I also made a calculation error in my initial answer, which led me to choose the incorrect answer. By reflecting on my mistake and re-evaluating the problem, I was able to arrive at the correct answer."
