My mistake was in not recognizing that $|n-1|$ is always positive, so the expression $|n-1|+1$ can never be equal to 0.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will break it down into smaller steps:\n\nStep 1: Simplify the expression $|n-1|+1$.\n\nSince $|n-1|$ is always positive, we can simplify the expression to:\n\n$|n-1| + 1 = n - 1 + 1$\n\nStep 2: Determine the value of $n$ that makes the expression equal to 0.\n\nWe are looking for the value of $n$ that makes the expression $|n-1| + 1 = 0$.\n\n$n - 1 + 1 = 0$\n\n$n = 2$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ that makes the expression equal to 0 is $n = 2$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
