I broke down the problem into simpler steps, but I did not check each step for accuracy. I also did not use visual aids to help with problem-solving.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow the correct steps and use visual aids to ensure accuracy.\n\nStep 1: Write the system of inequalities in the $x y$-plane.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}& y<-x+a \\\\& y>x+b\\end{aligned}$$\n\nStep 2: Find the point of intersection of the two lines.\n\nTo do this, I will use the point-slope form of a line, which is:\n\n$y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$\n\nWhere $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line, and $m$ is the slope of the line.\n\nIn this case, the point of intersection is $(0,0)$, so the slope of the line passing through the point $(0,0)$ is $m = \\frac{y}{x}$.\n\nStep 3: Check the inequality conditions at the point of intersection.\n\nAt the point $(0,0)$, the inequality conditions become:\n\n$y < 0 + a$\n$y > 0 + b$\n\nI will check these inequality conditions by substituting the values of $a$ and $b$ into the inequalities.\n\n$y < 0 + a$ becomes $y < a$\n$y > 0 + b$ becomes $y > b$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are both positive, the inequality conditions are satisfied, and the point $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities.\n\nStep 4: Determine the relationship between $a$ and $b$.\n\nSince the point $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities, we can conclude that the relationship between $a$ and $b$ must satisfy the following inequality:\n\n$a > b$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) $b > a$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
