Factoring or simplifying: The equation cannot be factored or simplified.\n3. Algebraic methods: To solve the equation, I tried using algebraic methods such as squaring both sides, but I couldn't find a solution.\n4. Calculations: I made a mistake in my previous solution by not considering the correct value of $k$. Using the correct value of $k$, I calculated the solution as $x=7$.\n5. Accuracy check: I double-checked my calculations, and they are accurate.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
