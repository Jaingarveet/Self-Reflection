I focused too much on the direct connections between locations and failed to consider the chain reactions caused by not visiting I Peak.\n## Deductions based on the conditions:\n* **Not visiting I Peak:** This directly implies **not visiting Lake J** due to condition (4).\n* **Not visiting Lake J:** Since at least one of Lake G or Lake J must be visited (condition 1), **the group must visit Lake G**.\n* **Visiting Lake G:** This implies that **the group must have visited either City E or City F** due to condition (2). \n* **Condition (3) is irrelevant** here as it only talks about the dependency of visiting Mountain H on visiting City E, but doesn't provide information in the opposite direction.\n## Analyzing the Choices:\n* **A: Incorrect.** We know they didn't visit Lake J.\n* **B: Incorrect.**  While they visited either E or F, we don't know which one specifically.\n* **C: Possibly correct.** We know they visited Lake G, but visiting Mountain H is not guaranteed.\n* **D: Incorrect.**  While they visited either E or F, we don't know which one specifically.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the deductions, the only option that must be true is that the group visited Lake G. Whether they visited Mountain H or not cannot be determined with certainty. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
