Remember, the number of spaces is typically one less than the number of pickets in a straight line.\n - Visualize the problem: Draw a simple diagram of the fence with a few pickets and spaces to help understand the pattern and relationships between elements.\n - Consider edge cases: Think about what happens when there is only one picket or a very small number of pickets. Does your solution still hold? \n - Be mindful of units: Ensure you are working with consistent units (inches or feet) throughout your calculations and convert correctly when necessary.\n"
