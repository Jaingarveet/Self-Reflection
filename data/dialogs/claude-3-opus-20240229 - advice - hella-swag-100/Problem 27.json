Flying kites indoors and landing them on the auditorium roof would be very difficult. And suddenly looking at a camera doesn't fit the context.\nB) The man continuing to fly kites while walking away as a woman speaks to the crowd is plausible. After his demonstration, he may leave as a presenter explains what occurred. This fits the auditorium setting.\nC) The man continuing to fly as a large group watches from the sides also makes sense. If this is some kind of kite-flying demonstration or performance, the audience would likely keep watching the ongoing action.\nD) Others in the auditorium also starting to fly kites is less likely. It would be chaotic to have many untrained people flying kites in an enclosed space. And there's no indication kites were handed out to the audience.\nConsidering the context of a kite-flying demonstration in an auditorium, I believe the most probable next occurrences are the man continuing his demonstration with the audience watching (C), or him finishing and walking off as a presenter speaks (B).\nBetween those, (C) seems most likely as a direct continuation of the described action. So that's my answer.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
