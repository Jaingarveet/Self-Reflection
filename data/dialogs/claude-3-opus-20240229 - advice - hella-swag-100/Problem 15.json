Steaming hot water is poured over the lemons in the glasses. \n2. The glasses are stirred with a stirring rod.\nThe most logical next step would be to cool the lemonade and prepare it for drinking. \nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: This describes a camera shot, not a lemonade-making step. It doesn't fit the context.\nB: Adding ice to cool the lemonade after stirring makes sense as the next step in the process. The \"poured afterwards\" likely refers to pouring the finished lemonade to serve.\nC: Adding vegetables and honey mustard to lemonade is illogical and doesn't fit the process.\nD: Pouring the lemonade into wooden bowls using a knife is illogical and unsafe. Glasses aren't usually \"taken off the counter\" in a recipe.\nConsidering the advice, B logically and grammatically fits as the next step in the lemonade-making process described. The other choices don't make sense in context.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
