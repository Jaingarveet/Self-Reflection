However, I can still answer the question using the given choices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nTo simplify the expression $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}}$, we can first simplify the denominator:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x+2}+\\frac{1}{x+3}} = \\frac{x+2}{x+2} \\cdot \\frac{x+3}{x+3} = \\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)(x+3)} = 1$$\n\nTherefore, the equivalent expression is:\n\n$$\\boxed{B: \\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}}$$\n\nThis answer is correct since:\n\n$$\\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5} = \\frac{(x+3)(x+2)}{2(x+2)} = 1$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is choice B."
