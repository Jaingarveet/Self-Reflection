        "content": "  The correct answer is B: $\\quad 5.7$\n\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the unit of measurement and thought the height was in feet instead of inches.\n\nThe correct calculation is:\n\n$h=3a+28.6$\n\n$h$ represents the height in inches\n\n$a$ represents the age in years\n\nTo find the estimated increase in height each year, we can isolate $a$ by subtracting 28.6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n$h-28.6=3a$\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3 to solve for $a$:\n\n$(h-28.6)/3=a$\n\nNow, we can find the estimated increase in height each year by taking the derivative of $a$ with respect to $h$:\n\n$d(a)/dh=(h-28.6)/3$\n\n$d(a)/dh=5.7$\n\nTherefore, the estimated increase in height each year is 5.7 inches.\n\nThe correct answer is B: $\\quad 5.7$"
