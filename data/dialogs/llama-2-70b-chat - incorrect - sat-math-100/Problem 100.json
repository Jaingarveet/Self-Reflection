This means that as $t$ increases, $a$ will also increase. Therefore, the speed of a sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second when $t$ is closest to 0.\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of $a$ for each choice:\n\nA: $a=1,052+1.08 \\times (-46)=946$\nB: $a=1,052+1.08 \\times (-48)=914$\nC: $a=1,052+1.08 \\times (-49)=882$\nD: $a=1,052+1.08 \\times (-50)=850$\n\nWe can see that the closest value to 1,000 is 914, which corresponds to choice B: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: $-48^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
