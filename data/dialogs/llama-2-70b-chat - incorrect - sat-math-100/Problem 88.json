Therefore, we can discard the negative solution and choose the positive solution:\n\n$$t+[REDACTED]=\\sqrt{4.9}$$\n\nSubtracting $[REDACTED]$ from both sides, we get:\n\n$$t=\\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of $t$ using the given choices:\n\nFor choice A, $t=3.5$:\n\n$$3.5=\\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$\n\nThis equation is not true, so we can eliminate choice A.\n\nFor choice B, $t=4.0$:\n\n$$4.0=\\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$\n\nThis equation is not true, so we can eliminate choice B.\n\nFor choice C, $t=4.5$:\n\n$$4.5=\\sqrt{4.9}-[REDACTED]$$\n\nThis equation is true, so we can select choice C.\n\nTherefore, the ball will hit the ground approximately $4.5$ seconds after it is launched.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
