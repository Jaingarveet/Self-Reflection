However, I can solve the question using the given information.\n\nWe are given a system of linear equations:\n\n2x - 3y = -14 ... (1)\n3x - 2y = -6 ... (2)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving equation (1) for x, we get:\n\nx = -3y + 14\n\nNow, substitute this expression for x into equation (2):\n\n3(-3y + 14) - 2y = -6\n\nExpand and simplify:\n\n-9y + 42 = -6\n\n9y = 36\n\ny = 4\n\nNow, substitute y = 4 into one of the original equations to solve for x:\n\n2x - 3(4) = -14\n\n2x - 12 = -14\n\n2x = -26\n\nx = -13\n\nSo, the value of x - y is:\n\nx - y = -13 - 4 = -17\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: -4\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
