Here's how I would solve the problem:\nLet (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) be the coordinates of the two points where the parabola and the line intersect. We can substitute the values of y1 and y2 into the equation of the parabola to get:\n(x1 - 11)^2 = 25\n(x2 - 11)^2 = 25\nWe can simplify these equations by adding 11 to both sides:\nx1^2 - 22x1 + 121 = 25\nx2^2 - 22x2 + 121 = 25\nWe can factor the left-hand sides of the equations:\n(x1 + 11)(x1 - 11) = 0\n(x2 + 11)(x2 - 11) = 0\nTherefore, x1 = -11 or x1 = 11, and x2 = -11 or x2 = 11.\nSince the line and the parabola intersect at two points, we need to find the distance between these points. We can do this by using the distance formula:\nAB = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\nWe can substitute the values of x1, x2, y1, and y2 into the formula:\nAB = sqrt((11 - (-11))^2 + (25 - (-11)^2))\nAB = sqrt(121 + 16)\nAB = sqrt(137)\nAB â‰ˆ 11.7\nThe length of  AB is approximately 11.7, which is between 10 and 12. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 12.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
