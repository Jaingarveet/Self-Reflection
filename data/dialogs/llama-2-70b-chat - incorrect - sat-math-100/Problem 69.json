The left-hand side is the number of miles per gallon, and the right-hand side is the total number of miles driven.\n\nB: $\\frac{25}{4} m=5$\nThis equation is also not correct for the same reason as choice A.\n\nC: $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$\nThis equation is correct. The left-hand side is the cost per gallon, and the right-hand side is the total weekly expenditure on gasoline that Alan wants to reduce.\n\nD: $\\frac{4}{25} m=5$\nThis equation is not correct. The left-hand side is the cost per gallon, and the right-hand side is a random number that does not relate to the problem.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nAlan can use the equation $\\frac{4}{25} m=95$ to determine how many fewer average miles he should drive each week."
