To find a factor of $f(x)$, we need to find a common factor of the given values of $f(x)$.\n\nWe can observe that $f(0) = 3$, $f(2) = 1$, $f(4) = 0$, and $f(5) = -2$.\n\nWe can factor out $x-3$ from all the values of $f(x)$:\n\n$f(0) = 3 = (x-3)(1)$\n$f(2) = 1 = (x-3)(1/2)$\n$f(4) = 0 = (x-3)(0)$\n$f(5) = -2 = (x-3)(-2/3)$\n\nTherefore, $x-3$ must be a factor of $f(x)$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
