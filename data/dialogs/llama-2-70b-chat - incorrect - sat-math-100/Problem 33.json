However, I can still answer the question using the given choices.\n\nThe equation of a circle with center $(a, b)$ and radius $r$ is given by:\n\n$$(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$$\n\nIn this case, the center of the circle is $(5, 7)$, and the radius is 2. Therefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\n$$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 4$$\n\nSo, the correct answer is choice A:\n\n$$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 4$$\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."
