However, I can provide a solution to the question.\n\nWe are given a system of two linear equations:\n\nkx - 3y = 4 ... (1)\n4x - 5y = 7 ... (2)\n\nWe need to find the value of k for which the system has no solution.\n\nFirst, we can solve equation (1) for x:\nx = (4 - 3y) / k\n\nNow, substitute the expression for x into equation (2):\n4((4 - 3y) / k) - 5y = 7\n\nExpand and simplify:\n16 - 12y / k - 5y = 7\n\nNow, we can see that the coefficient of y is negative, so we know that the system has no solution if k = -16/7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
