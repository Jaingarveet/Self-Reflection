Without this information, I cannot help you answer the question.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some guidance on how to approach the problem. The equation âˆš4x = x - 3 can be solved by squaring both sides, which results in 4x = x^2 - 6x + 9. Now, we can factor the left-hand side as 4(x - 3)(x + 3) = 0.\n\nTherefore, we have four possible solutions: x - 3 = 0, x + 3 = 0, x - 3 = 1/4, and x + 3 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the values of x that satisfy the equation are x = 3, x = -3, x = 1/4, and x = -1/4.\n\nNow, let's match these solutions with the choices provided:\n\nA: I only - This choice corresponds to x = 3 and x = -3.\nB: II only - This choice corresponds to x = 1/4 and x = -1/4.\nC: I and II - This choice corresponds to all four solutions.\nD: Neither I nor II - This choice corresponds to none of the solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: I and II."
