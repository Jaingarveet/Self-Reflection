The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?\nChoices:\n  A: $\\$ 90$\n  B: $\\$ 120$\n  C: $\\$ 133$\n  D: $\\$ 155$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

        "content": "  The information that is given in the problem statement is:\n\nS(P) = (1/2)P + 40\nD(P) = 220 - P\n\nWe are asked to find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded. In other words, we need to find the price at which S(P) = D(P).\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set S(P) equal to D(P) and solve for P:\n\n(1/2)P + 40 = 220 - P\n\nWe can simplify this equation by combining like terms:\n\nP/2 + 40 = 220\n\nWe can then solve for P by subtracting 40 from both sides:\n\nP/2 = 180\n\nWe can then multiply both sides by 2 to solve for P:\n\nP = 360\n\nSo, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded is $360.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC: $360\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
