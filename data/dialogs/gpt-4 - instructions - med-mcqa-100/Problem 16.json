In case of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery, anastomosis (connection) between certain arteries can help maintain the blood supply. The anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery can maintain the blood supply to the upper limb in such a case.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
