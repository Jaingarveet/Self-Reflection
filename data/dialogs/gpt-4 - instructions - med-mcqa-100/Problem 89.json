It is diagnosed using imaging studies to see the bones and the surrounding soft tissues. \nA: Anteroposterior X-ray - This can show the alignment of the vertebrae and can detect any slippage.\nB: Lateral view X-ray - This is particularly useful in diagnosing spondylolisthesis as it can clearly show if one vertebra has slipped forward over another.\nC: CT - This can provide detailed images of the bones and can show the degree of slippage and any associated fractures.\nD: MRI - This is useful in showing the soft tissues, including the nerves and spinal cord. However, it may not be as useful as the other methods in showing the bones and the degree of slippage.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
