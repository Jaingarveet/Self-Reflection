This can be due to several reasons. \nA: Oligohydramnios - This is a condition where there is less amniotic fluid around the baby. This could potentially cause an unstable lie as the baby has more room to move around.\nB: Placenta Previa - This is a condition where the placenta covers the cervix. This could potentially cause an unstable lie as the baby may not be able to settle into a stable position due to the placenta's position.\nC: Pelvic Tumor - A tumor in the pelvis could potentially cause an unstable lie as it may interfere with the baby's ability to settle into a stable position.\nD: Uterine anomalies - Anomalies or abnormalities in the shape or structure of the uterus could potentially cause an unstable lie as they may interfere with the baby's ability to settle into a stable position.\nConsidering the options, Oligohydramnios seems to be the most likely cause of an unstable lie in a multigravida woman with previous normal deliveries.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
