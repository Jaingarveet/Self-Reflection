        "content": "Reflection:\nThe previous question was about a club with members whose ages are in arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all the ages is 250 years.\n\nTo solve this problem, I need to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\nSum = (n/2) \\* (a\\_1 + a\\_n)\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a\\_1 is the first term, and a\\_n is the last term.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the ages to months:\n\n* The youngest member is 7 years old, which is 7 \\* 12 = 84 months old.\n* The sum of all the ages is 250 years, which is 250 \\* 12 = 3000 months.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of terms (n) using the formula:\n\n3000 = (n/2) \\* (84 + a\\_n)\n\nSince the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, I can express a\\_n as:\n\na\\_n = a\\_1 + (n - 1) \\* d\n\nwhere d is the common difference.\n\nSubstituting a\\_1 = 84 and d = 3, I get:\n\na\\_n = 84 + (n - 1) \\* 3\n\nNow I can substitute this expression for a\\_n back into the sum formula:\n\n3000 = (n/2) \\* (84 + 84 + (n - 1) \\* 3)\n\nSimplifying, I get:\n\n3000 = (n/2) \\* (168 + 3n - 3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2/n, I get:\n\n6000/n = 168 + 3n - 3\n\nRearranging, I get:\n\n3n^2 - 165n + 6000 = 0\n\nDividing both sides by 3, I get:\n\nn^2 - 55n + 2000 = 0\n\nFactoring, I get:\n\n(n - 25)(n - 80) = 0\n\nThe possible values for n are 25 and 80. However, since the common difference is 3 months, it is not possible to have 80 members with ages in A.P. starting from 84 months. Therefore, the number of members in the club is 25.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
