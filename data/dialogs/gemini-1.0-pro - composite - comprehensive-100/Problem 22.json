        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that Nina's report could not be on Wednesday. \nI overlooked the exception in the rule about Nina's report. \nI focused too much on the constraint about Nina's report and did not consider the possibility that the exception could apply.\nError Keywords:\n - Rule-based reasoning error\n - Exception handling error\n - Overlooking exception\nSolution:\nGeorge, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.\nGeorge can only give a report on Tuesday.\nNina's report cannot be on Wednesday.\nOlivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.\nIf Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.\nNina's report cannot be on Wednesday because George and Robert are giving reports on the other two days.\nTherefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.\nSince Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.\nTherefore, [REDACTED]\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the students who are giving reports.\n2. Identify the days on which the reports are given.\n3. Identify the constraints on the days on which each student can give a report.\n4. Identify the rules that govern the order of the reports.\n5. Consider all exceptions to the rules.\n6. Apply the rules and exceptions to the specific case.\n7. Work step-by-step through the reasoning process.\n8. Double-check your reasoning and conclusions.\n9. Choose the answer that matches your conclusions.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n - Pay close attention to exceptions and special cases.\n - Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that are not consistent with the given information.\n"
