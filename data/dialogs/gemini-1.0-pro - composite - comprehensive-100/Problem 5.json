If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :\nChoices:\n  A: 18\n  B: 20\n  C: 25\n  D: 26\n  E: 27\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the ages of the members. I used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but I did not take into account the fact that the youngest member is 7 years old.\nError Keywords:\n - Calculation error\n - Arithmetic series error\n - Age calculation error\nSolution:\nLet the number of members in the club be n.\nThen, the sum of the ages of all the members = 7 + (7 + 3) + (7 + 6) + ... + (7 + 3(n - 1))\n= n(7 + 3(n - 1))/2\n= [REDACTED]0\n=> n(7 + 3n - 3) = 500\n=> n(3n + 4) = 500\n=> 3n^2 + 4n - 500 = 0\n=> 3n^2 + 30n - [REDACTED]n - 500 = 0\n=> 3n(n + 10) - [REDACTED](n + 10) = 0\n=> (3n - [REDACTED])(n + 10) = 0\n=> n = [REDACTED] or n = -10\nSince, the number of members cannot be negative, therefore n = [REDACTED].\nThe sum of the ages of the members is [REDACTED]0.\nThe average age of the members is [REDACTED]0/[REDACTED] = 9.61 years.\nThe youngest member is 7 years old.\nThe oldest member is 7 + 3([REDACTED] - 1) = 80 years old.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given information and what is being asked.\n3. Determine the appropriate formula or method to solve the problem.\n4. Apply the formula or method step-by-step.\n5. Check your calculations and answer.\n6. Make sure your answer is consistent with the given information.\nAdvice:\n- Be careful with calculations and double-check your work.\n- Pay attention to units and make sure they are consistent.\n- Consider all possible cases and scenarios.\n- Use common sense and logic to check your answer.\n- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem into smaller parts.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n"
