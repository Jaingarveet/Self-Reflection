Identify the system of equations to be solved.\n2. Choose a variable to solve for using substitution.\n3. Solve for the chosen variable in terms of the other variable.\n4. Substitute the solved expression for the chosen variable into the other equation.\n5. Solve for the remaining variable.\n6. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into the equation from step 3 to solve for the first variable.\n7. Double-check all calculations and substitutions.\n8.
