Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nError Keywords:\nSolution:\nInstructions:\nAdvice:\n"

While it is true that different people are allergic to different proteins, the passage does not state that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cats but not to others. Instead, it emphasizes that all cats shed skin and spread saliva, making it impossible for any cat to be incapable of provoking allergic reactions. \nTherefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the information is:\n**B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.** \nThis statement aligns directly with the passage's assertion that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary among individuals. \nI will strive to avoid similar misinterpretations in the future by carefully analyzing the provided information and focusing on the key points rather than drawing unwarranted conclusions. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \n"
