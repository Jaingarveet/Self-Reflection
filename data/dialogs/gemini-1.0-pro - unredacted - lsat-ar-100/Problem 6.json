        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the information provided was sufficient to determine the exact number of plays each student reviewed. However, the information only establishes relative comparisons between the students' reviews.\nError Keywords:\n- Incomplete information\n- Relative comparison\n- Assumption\nSolution:\n1. Identify the relative comparisons provided:\n    - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.\n    - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.\n    - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.\n    - Exactly two students review the same plays.\n2. Analyze the choices based on the relative comparisons:\n    - A: Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n    - B: Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang does. This MUST be true. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review at least one more play than Jiang.\n    - C: Megregian reviews more plays than O'Neill does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n    - D: O'Neill reviews more plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\n    - E: O'Neill reviews more plays than Kramer does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read and understand the problem statement and all provided information.\n2. Identify the relative comparisons and absolute values explicitly stated in the problem.\n3. Analyze the choices based on the identified information, considering both relative comparisons and absolute values.\n4. Choose the answer that is definitively true based on the available information, even if other possibilities exist.\nAdvice:\n- Be cautious of making assumptions based on incomplete information.\n- Focus on identifying the relative comparisons and absolute values explicitly stated in the problem.\n- Analyze the choices systematically, considering all possibilities allowed by the available information.\n- Choose the answer that is definitively true, even if other possibilities remain.\n"
