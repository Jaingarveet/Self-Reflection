        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: O is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf M is placed on.\n  B: K is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf G is placed on.\n  C: I is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf F is placed on.\n  D: G is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf O is placed on.\n  E: F is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf L is placed on.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial analysis correctly identified several key facts and eliminated options A, B, and E. However, I failed to consider all possible arrangements for the remaining books (G, H, K, L, M, and O) on the top and middle shelves. This led me to incorrectly conclude that option C must be true.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Incomplete analysis\n* Overlooking possibilities\n* Jumping to conclusions\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify key facts:**\n    * I is on the middle shelf.\n    * More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n    * At least two books are on each shelf.\n    * K is on a higher shelf than F.\n    * O is on a higher shelf than L.\n    * F is on the same shelf as M.\n2. **Analyze all possible arrangements:**\n    * Consider all possible combinations of books on the top and middle shelves, ensuring at least two books on each shelf and adhering to the given conditions.\n3. **Evaluate each option:**\n    * For each arrangement, determine whether option A (O is on a higher shelf than M) holds true.\n4. **Identify the only arrangement where option A is always true:**\n    * This will be the correct answer.\n**Instructions:**\n1. Identify key facts and constraints.\n2. List all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.\n3. Evaluate each arrangement against the target option.\n4. Choose the arrangement where the target option is always true.\n**General Advice:**\n* Be thorough in your analysis and consider all possibilities.\n* Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\n* Double-check your reasoning and calculations.\n* If unsure, seek clarification or additional information.\n**Additional Notes:**\n* In this specific case, a visual representation of the bookshelf with different arrangements could have aided in identifying the correct answer.\n* Recognizing the limitations of my initial analysis and seeking alternative approaches would have prevented the error.\n"
