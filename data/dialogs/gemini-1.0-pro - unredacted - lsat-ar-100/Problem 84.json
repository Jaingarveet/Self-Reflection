        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly analyzed the conditions and made a mistake in my reasoning. \nI focused on the individual conditions but failed to consider the overall picture.\nError Keywords:\n - Logical error\n - Reasoning error\n - Condition analysis error\nSolution:\n1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n2. I is placed on the middle shelf.\n3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.\n4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.\n5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nLet's analyze the choices:\nA: F, M - This violates condition 1 as only two books are on the bottom shelf.\nB: F, H, M - This satisfies all conditions. G and H are on the top shelf, I is on the middle shelf, K and O are on the bottom shelf, and F and M are on the bottom shelf.\nC: G, H, K - This violates condition 4 as L and O are on the same shelf.\nD: F, G, M, O - This violates condition 1 as only four books are on the bottom shelf.\nE: G, H, L, M - This violates condition 3 as F and K are on the same shelf.\nInstructions:\n1. Read and understand all conditions carefully.\n2. Analyze each condition individually and in relation to other conditions.\n3. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy all conditions.\n4. Eliminate choices that violate any of the conditions.\n5. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions and creates a logical and consistent scenario.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of each condition.\n - Consider the implications of each condition in relation to other conditions.\n - Think through all possible scenarios and eliminate those that do not fit.\n - Be systematic and methodical in your analysis.\n - Double-check your reasoning and conclusions before making a final decision.\n"
