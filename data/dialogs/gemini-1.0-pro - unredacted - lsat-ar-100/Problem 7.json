        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly five witnesses—Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson—are to be scheduled to testify at a hearing that is to take exactly three days of one week—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each witness testifies on exactly one day of the hearing. The schedule must meet the following conditions: Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Hong does not testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday.\nQuestion: If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, which one of the following must be true of the schedule?\nChoices:\n  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.\n  B: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.\n  D: Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\n  E: Garcia is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Reason for Incorrect Answer:**\nMy initial reasoning was flawed. While I correctly identified that Franco and Garcia could not testify on the same day and that Iturbe would testify on Wednesday, I failed to consider the constraint that exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Franco and Garcia would both testify on Tuesday, leaving Hong as the only option for Monday.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Logical Reasoning Error:** I made an error in my logical deduction, failing to account for all the given constraints.\n* **Oversight:** I overlooked the constraint about the number of witnesses testifying on Tuesday.\n* **Incomplete Analysis:** My analysis was incomplete, focusing only on specific constraints and not considering the overall picture.\n## Solution with Correct Answer\n**Step 1: Identify Constraints:**\n* Jackson testifies on Monday.\n* Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.\n* Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.\n* Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.\n**Step 2: Apply Constraints:**\n* Since Jackson is the only witness on Monday, Franco and Garcia cannot be on Monday.\n* Iturbe is on Wednesday, leaving Tuesday for Franco and Garcia.\n* To fulfill the constraint of two witnesses on Tuesday, both Franco and Garcia must be on Tuesday.\n* This leaves Hong as the only option for Wednesday.\n**Step 3: Verify:**\n* Jackson - Monday\n* Franco and Garcia - Tuesday\n* Hong - Wednesday\n* Iturbe - Wednesday\nThis schedule satisfies all the given constraints.\n## Instructions for Future Success\n1. **Read and understand all constraints carefully.**\n2. **Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.**\n3. **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that violate any constraint.**\n4. **Double-check your reasoning and calculations before arriving at a conclusion.**\n5. **Be mindful of potential oversights and ensure a comprehensive analysis.**\n## General Advice for Similar Problems\n* **Pay close attention to keywords and specific details in the problem statement.**\n* **Visualize the problem using diagrams or tables if helpful.**\n* **Test different scenarios and eliminate those that don't work.**\n* **Don't rush to a conclusion; take your time and think through each step carefully.**\n* **Learn from your mistakes and use them to improve your problem-solving skills.**\nBy following these steps and advice, I can improve my accuracy and avoid similar mistakes in the future.\n"
