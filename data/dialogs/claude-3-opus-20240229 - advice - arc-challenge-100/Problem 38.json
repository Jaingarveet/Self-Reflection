        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. The question provides the densities of red-clay bricks (2000 kg/m^3) and air (1 kg/m^3).\n2. To find the mass, we use the formula: mass = density × volume\n3. For each choice, let's calculate the mass:\nA. 2 m^3 of bricks\n   mass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 2 m^3 = 4000 kg\nB. 4 m^3 of bricks \n   mass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 4 m^3 = 8000 kg\nC. 6000 m^3 of air\n   mass = 1 kg/m^3 × 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg\nD. 10,000 m^3 of air\n   mass = 1 kg/m^3 × 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg\n4. Comparing the masses:\n   6000 kg < 10,000 kg < 4000 kg < 8000 kg\nTherefore, 6000 m^3 of air has the lowest mass among the given choices.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
