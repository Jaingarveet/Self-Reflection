I knew that sugilation had something to do with the appearance of blood in the skin, but I didn't know the correct term.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Confusion\n* Misinformation\n* Terminology error\n\nSolution:\nSuggilation refers to the postmortem staining of the skin due to the settling of blood in the lower parts of the body. This occurs due to gravity and can be used to determine the position of the body at the time of death.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the terminology used in forensic medicine.\n2. Understand the difference between sugilation, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and postmortem caloricity.\n3. Remember that sugilation refers to the postmortem staining of the skin due to the settling of blood in the lower parts of the body.\n4. Associate sugilation with the correct term, \"postmortem staining.\"\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and familiarize yourself with the terminology used in the field of medicine, especially in forensic medicine.\n* Pay close attention to the exact terms used in questions and answers.\n* Avoid confusing similar terms, and take the time to double-check your answers.\n* Practice, practice, practice!
