Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I thought it was because they are a weak acid and weak base combination, which allows them to effectively maintain pH homeostasis in the body. However, the correct reason is that bicarbonate buffers have a high concentration in blood, which makes them effective at maintaining pH homeostasis.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Incorrect reasoning\n\nSolution:\nBicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood because they have a high concentration. This allows them to effectively react with excess hydrogen ions (H+) or hydroxide ions (OH-) to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3-), respectively, and maintain pH homeostasis in the body.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the correct reason why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood.\n2. Recall that bicarbonate buffers have a high concentration in blood.\n3. Understand that this high concentration allows bicarbonate buffers to effectively maintain pH homeostasis in the body.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always carefully read and understand the question before answering.\n* Make sure you have a clear understanding of the underlying concepts before applying them to a problem.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the relevant information.\n* In biochemistry, it's important to understand the properties and functions of different molecules, such as bicarbonate buffers, and how they contribute to maintaining pH homeostasis in the body."
