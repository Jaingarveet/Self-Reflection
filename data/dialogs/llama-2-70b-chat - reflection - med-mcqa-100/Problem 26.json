Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

I knew that flexion and extension in the neck occur at the Atlanto-axial joint, but I mistakenly identified the wrong joint.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Joint confusion\n* Anatomy mistake\n* Neck joints\n\nSolution:\nFlexion and extension in the neck occur at the Atlanto-occipital joint. This joint is between the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone. It allows for the nodding movement of the head.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the joint that allows for the nodding movement of the head.\n2. Recall the location of the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone.\n3. Associate the Atlanto-occipital joint with the correct movement.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Review the anatomy of the neck joints to avoid confusion.\n* Pay close attention to the specific movement associated with each joint.\n* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or illustrations, to help reinforce your understanding.\n* Practice identifying the different joints and their associated movements to build confidence."
