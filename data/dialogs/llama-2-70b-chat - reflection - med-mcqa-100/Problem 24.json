Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the antithyroid drug that is safe to use during pregnancy.\n2. Research the safety profile of each antithyroid drug.\n3. Choose the drug with the lowest risk of adverse effects during pregnancy.\nAdvice:\n- Always research the safety profile of medications, especially during pregnancy.\n- Never assume that a medication is safe during pregnancy without proper research.\n- Always prioritize the safety of the patient, especially during pregnancy.\n- Keep up-to-date with the latest research and guidelines regarding medication use during pregnancy."
