Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

It can be due to:\nChoices:\n  A: Oligohydramnios\n  B: Placenta pre\n  C: Pelvic tumor\n  D: Uterine anomalies\n\n  Thought: \nAn unstable lie in a multigravida patient with previous normal deliveries at 34 weeks of gestation could be due to several factors. However, the most likely cause is:\n\nOption D: Uterine anomalies.\n\nUterine anomalies, such as a unicornuate uterus or a bicornuate uterus, can cause an unstable lie and may not have been detected previously. The patient's history of previous normal deliveries reduces the likelihood of the other options: oligohydramnios (A), placenta previa (B), and pelvic tumor (C).\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "  Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I overlooked the possibility of placenta previa, which can also cause an unstable lie. I focused too much on the patient's history of previous normal deliveries, which led me to dismiss option B.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Overlooked possibility\n* Misjudged likelihood\n\nSolution:\nI should have considered all options carefully and not ruled out placenta previa based solely on the patient's history. Placenta previa can occur in any pregnancy, regardless of previous deliveries.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key elements.\n2. Consider all options and their likelihood based on the patient's history and current symptoms.\n3. Evaluate each option based on its possibility and potential impact on the patient's condition.\n4. Choose the most likely option based on your evaluation.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always consider all options carefully and do not rule out any possibility based on preconceived notions.\n* Evaluate each option based on its likelihood and potential impact on the patient's condition.\n* Use your knowledge and experience to guide your decision-making process.\n* Double-check your answer and consider alternative explanations before submitting your response."
