Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the facial artery and its origin.\n2. Identify the infraorbital artery and its origin.\n3. Understand the anastomosis between the facial artery and the infraorbital artery.\n4. Recall that the maxillary artery is a different branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the maxilla and other structures in the face.\n5. Double-check your answer by reviewing the anatomy of the blood vessels in the face.\nAdvice:\n- Always review the anatomy of the structures involved in a question.\n- Be careful not to confuse similar structures or their relationships.\n- Double-check your answer by reviewing the relevant anatomy.\n- Practice recalling the branches of the external carotid artery and their destinations.\n- Practice identifying the anastomoses between blood vessels in the face."
