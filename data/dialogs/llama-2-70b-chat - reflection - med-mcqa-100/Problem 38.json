Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Review the radiological features of ureterocele and posterior urethral valve.\n2. Understand the difference between the two conditions and their characteristic radiological appearances.\n3. Remember that cobra snake head appearance is a feature of ureterocele, not posterior urethral valve.\n4. In similar questions, carefully read the options and associate the radiological feature with the correct condition.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and update your knowledge of radiological features and their associated conditions.\n* Be careful when associating radiological features with conditions, and double-check your answers.\n* Use radiological images and illustrations to aid in your understanding and memory of characteristic features.\n* Practice identifying radiological features and their associated conditions to improve your accuracy."
