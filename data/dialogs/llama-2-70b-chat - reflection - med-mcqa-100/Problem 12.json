Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine and does not require aminoacyl t-RNA.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Exception to the rule\n* Confusion between similar concepts\n\nSolution:\nAminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids except proline and hydroxylysine. Hydroxylysine is synthesized from glutamine, just like proline.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the exceptions to the rule that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids.\n2. Understand the difference between proline and hydroxylysine synthesis.\n3. Recall that hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine.\n4. Choose the correct answer, C, Hydroxylysine.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and understand the exceptions to a rule.\n* Be aware of similarities and differences between related concepts.\n* Double-check your answers, especially when there are similar options.\n* Use mnemonic devices to remember exceptions to rules.\n* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence."
