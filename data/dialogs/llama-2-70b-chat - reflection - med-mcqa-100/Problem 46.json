Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Review the key features of each type of glomerulonephritis, including RPGN, acute GN, membranous GN, and MPGN.\n2. Pay close attention to the specific characteristics of each disease, such as the presence of crescent-shaped deposits in MPGN and the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane in membranous nephropathy.\n3. Make sure to associate the correct pathological features with each disease.\n4. Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the available choices.\n\nAdvice:\n- Always review the key features of each disease before answering a question.\n- Pay close attention to the specific characteristics of each disease, such as the presence of crescent-shaped deposits or the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane.\n- Associate the correct pathological features with each disease.\n- Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the available choices.\n- Practice, practice, practice! The more you practice, the more familiar you will become with the key features of each disease, and the less likely you are to make mistakes."
