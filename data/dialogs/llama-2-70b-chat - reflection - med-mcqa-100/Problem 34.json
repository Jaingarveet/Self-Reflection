Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Spring catarrh is actually a type of type II hypersensitivity reaction, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity. In this reaction, the immune system produces antibodies that target and destroy cells that have taken up the allergen, in this case, pollen.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Type II hypersensitivity\n* Cytotoxic hypersensitivity\n* Allergic rhinitis\n\nSolution:\nSpring catarrh is a type of allergic rhinitis caused by pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds. It is a type of hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n1. Identify the type of hypersensitivity reaction that spring catarrh is.\n2. Look up the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions.\n3. Match the characteristics of spring catarrh to the characteristics of type II hypersensitivity reactions.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Research the different types of hypersensitivity reactions.\n2. Study the characteristics of each type of hypersensitivity reaction.\n3. Practice identifying the type of hypersensitivity reaction given a description of a condition.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always research and understand the different types of hypersensitivity reactions.\n* Always study the characteristics of each type of hypersensitivity reaction.\n* Practice identifying the type of hypersensitivity reaction given a description of a condition.\n* Never confuse type II hypersensitivity reactions with other types.\n* Always double-check your answer by matching the characteristics of the condition to the characteristics of the hypersensitivity reaction."
