Substituting this expression for $x$ into the second equation, we get:\n\\[2y - \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}y - \\frac{23}{3}\\right) = -19\\]\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\\frac{2}{3}y = -\\frac{14}{3}\\]\nSolving for $y$, we get $y = -2$. Substituting this value of $y$ back into the expression for $x$, we get $x = -\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot -2 - \\frac{23}{3} = 3$. So, the solution is $(3, -2)$. \n\nChecking this solution in the original equations:\n$3(3) + 4(-2) = -23$ and $2(-2) - 3(3) = -19$, both equations are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is $(3, -2)$, which is choice **B**.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
