This means that the discriminant of the quadratic equation, $(25 + 8a)^2 - 4 \\cdot 24 \\cdot (3a - 47)$, should be equal to zero. Solving this results in $a = 3$ or $a = -\\frac{1}{3}$. However, $a = -\\frac{1}{3}$ can be ruled out since the problem states that $a$ is a constant, and the choices provided include only integers.\n\nTherefore, the value of $a$ is $3$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
