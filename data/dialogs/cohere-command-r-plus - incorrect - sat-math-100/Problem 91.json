For n = 1, f(1) = -1, which is incorrect.\nChoice C: f(n) = 3n - 5 is also incorrect. For n = 1, f(1) = -2, but the table shows f(1) = -3.\nChoice D: f(n) = 4n - 6 is not a linear function that represents the given table. For n = 1, f(1) = -2, which doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is none of the above.
