Let the speed of the current be x kmph.\n2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.\n3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.\n4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed\n   2 = 4 - x\n   x = 4 - 2 = 2\n   So, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.\n5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed \n                             = 4 + 2 = 6\nTherefore, the man's speed along the current is [REDACTED].\nBoth choice [REDACTED] and choice [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], so either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] is correct.\n"

To find the speed of the current, we can use the formula:\n   Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed\n   2 = 4 - x\n   Solving for x:\n   x = 4 - 2 = 2\n   So the speed of the current is 2 kmph.\n4. Now to find the man's speed along the current, we use:\n   Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed\n                            = 4 + 2 = 6\nTherefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.\nLooking at the choices, both B and E state 6 kmph. Since the question doesn't specify to select the first correct answer, either B or E would be acceptable.\nI'll go with B as it's the first listed correct answer.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
