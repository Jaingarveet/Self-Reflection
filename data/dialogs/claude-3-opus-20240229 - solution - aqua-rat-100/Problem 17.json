What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?\nChoices:\n  A: 226\n  B: 230\n  C: 240\n  D: 260\n  E: 280\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. The company produces 420 units per month.\n2. The production cost per unit is $110.\n3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.\nTo find the minimum selling price, we need to:\n1. Calculate the yearly production\n   - Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units\n2. Calculate the yearly production cost\n   - Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400\n3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost to get the total revenue needed\n   - Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit\n   - Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800\n4. Divide the total revenue needed by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit\n   - Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production\n   - Minimum selling price per unit = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.2857... per unit\n   - Rounding up, the minimum selling price per unit is $235\nThe correct answer choice is [REDACTED]: $[REDACTED], as this is the minimum selling price from the given options that is greater than or equal to the calculated $234.29 per unit.\n"
