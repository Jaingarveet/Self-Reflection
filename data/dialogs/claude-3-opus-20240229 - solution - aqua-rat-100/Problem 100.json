What is the perimeter of the piece?\nChoices:\n  A: 60 m\n  B: 61 m\n  C: 62 m\n  D: 63 m\n  E: 64 m\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.\n2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.\n3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:\n   x(4x + 1) = 150\n4. Expanding the equation:\n   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0\n5. Solving this quadratic equation:\n   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0\n   So, x = 15/4 or -10\n   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m\n6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m\n7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length) + 2(breadth)\n   = 2(16) + 2(3.75) \n   = 32 + 7.5\n   = 39.5 m\n8. Rounding 39.5 m to the nearest whole number gives 40 m.\nThe correct answer is 40 m, which corresponds to option [REDACTED].\n"
