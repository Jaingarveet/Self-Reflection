Although the letter 'C' is repeated, we are told that we need to rearrange the letters such that none of the letters repeat. This means we should treat each 'C' as distinct, like 'C1' and 'C2'.\nSo, we effectively have 7 distinct letters: P, R, O, [REDACTED], L, [REDACTED], C1, C2.\nThe number of ways to arrange n distinct objects is given by n!.\nHere, n = 7. So the number of ways to rearrange \"PROBLE[REDACTED]\" such that no letters repeat is [REDACTED] = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5040.\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].\n"
