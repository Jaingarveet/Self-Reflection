But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have?\nChoices:\n  A: 62, 35\n  B: 62, 34\n  C: 34, 62\n  D: 42, 62\n  E: 62, 42\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet's solve this problem again, step-by-step:\n1. Let's assume Arjun has 'x' dollars and Sajal has 'y' dollars.\n2. According to the first condition:\n   If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.\n   Mathematically, y + 30 = 2(x - 30)\n   Simplifying, y + 30 = 2x - 60\n   y = 2x - 90 ... (Equation 1)\n3. According to the second condition:\n   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.\n   Mathematically, x + 10 = 3(y - 10)\n   Simplifying, x + 10 = 3y - 30\n   x = 3y - 40 ... (Equation 2)\n4. Substitute the value of y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:\n   x = 3(2x - 90) - 40\n   x = 6x - 270 - 40\n   x = 6x - 310\n   5x = 310\n   x = 62\n5. Now, substitute x = 62 into Equation 1:\n   y = 2(62) - 90\n   y = 124 - 90\n   y = 34\nTherefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.\n"
