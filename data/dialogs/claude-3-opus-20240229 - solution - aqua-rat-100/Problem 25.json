The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\nChoices:\n  A: 5(√3 + 1)\n  B: 6(√3 + √2)\n  C: 7(√3 – 1)\n  D: 8(√3 – 2)\n  E: None of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1) Let the height of the tower be h and the uniform speed of the car be v. \n   Also, let the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.\n2) At the start, tan(45°) = h/x. Therefore, x = h.\n3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). \n   Therefore, √3 = h/(x - 10v).\n4) Substituting x = h from step 2, we get:\n   √3 = h/(h - 10v)\n   √3(h - 10v) = h\n   √3h - 10√3v = h\n   √3h - h = 10√3v\n   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v\n5) Now, let's find the additional time taken. If the remaining distance is y, then:\n   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v\n   Therefore, the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes\n6) Simplifying correctly, 10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 10(3/√3 - √3/√3) = 10(√3 - 1) = [REDACTED]\nTherefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in [REDACTED] more minutes.\n"
