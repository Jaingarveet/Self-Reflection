The well is 30m deep, and the frog starts at the bottom (depth = 30m).\n2. Each day, the frog jumps up 3m and then falls back down 2m.\n3. Effectively, the frog gains 1m per day (3m - 2m = 1m).\n4. After [REDACTED], the frog will have climbed 27m ([REDACTED] * 1m/day = 27m).\n5. On the 28th day, the frog will jump up 3m, reaching a height of 30m (27m + 3m = 30m).\n6. The frog will now be at the top of the well, ready to escape. It will not fall back down 2m on this last day.\nTherefore, it will take the frog [REDACTED] to come out of the well.\n"
