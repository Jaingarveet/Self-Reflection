What could be the least possible no of students in the school?\nChoices:\n  A: 550\n  B: 570\n  C: 600\n  D: 700\n  E: none of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet the total number of students be x.\nNumber of students who took physics = 20% of x = 0.2x (must be a whole number)\nNumber of students who took math = 28% of x = 0.28x (must be a whole number)\nFor 0.2x and 0.28x to be whole numbers, x must be a multiple of 25.\nThe least multiple of 25 greater than 501 is 525. However, 20% of 525 is 105 and 28% of 525 is 147. The sum 105 + 147 = 252, which is 48% of 525. This implies that 52% of students took neither physics nor math, which is not possible.\nIn fact, for any number of students, the sum of the percentages of physics and math students cannot exceed 100%. Therefore, there is no possible number of students that satisfies the given conditions.\n"

If 20% took physics and 28% took math, that would imply 52% took neither, which is not possible.\nTherefore, there is no possible number of students that satisfies the given conditions, and the correct answer is \"none of these\"."
