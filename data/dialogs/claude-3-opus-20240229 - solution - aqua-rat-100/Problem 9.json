If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?\nChoices:\n  A: 12\n  B: 16\n  C: 24\n  D: 30\n  E: 40\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n1. Understand the given information:\n   * The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.\n   * Each bag is sold for $100.\n   * The total profit made is $3,000.\n2. Calculate the profit made on each bag in dollars:\n   * Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price\n   * 25% of Selling price = Selling price - Cost price\n   * 0.25 × $100 = $100 - Cost price\n   * $25 = $100 - Cost price\n   * Cost price = $100 - $25 = $75\n   * Profit per bag = $100 - $75 = $25\n3. Calculate the number of bags sold:\n   * Number of bags sold = Total profit ÷ Profit per bag\n   * Number of bags sold = $3,000 ÷ $25 = [REDACTED]0\n4. Find the answer among the given choices:\n   * The closest choice to [REDACTED]0 is [REDACTED]0 itself, but it's not available.\n   * The next closest choice is [REDACTED]0 ÷ 5 = [REDACTED].\n"
