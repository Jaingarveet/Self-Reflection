Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?\nChoices:\n  A: 12/25\n  B: 3/2\n  C: 3\n  D: 2\n  E: 25/3\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet p = number of pita breads, r = number of rolls, b = number of baguettes\nFrom the given information:\n6p = [REDACTED]r (six pita breads equal two rolls)\n[REDACTED]r = 5b (three rolls equal five baguettes)\nWe want to find x such that xp = [REDACTED]b\nFrom the first equation: r = [REDACTED]p\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n[REDACTED]([REDACTED]p) = 5b\n9p = 5b\nNow, we have xp = [REDACTED]b and 9p = 5b. Solving for x:\nxp = [REDACTED]b\nx(9p) = x(5b)\n9xp = 10b\n9x = 10\nx = 10/9\nSo, 10/9 pita breads equal 1 baguette.\nThe question asks for the number of pita breads equal to [REDACTED] baguettes.\nTherefore, we multiply 10/9 by [REDACTED]:\n(10/9) * [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]0/9 ≈ [REDACTED].[REDACTED][REDACTED]\nRounding [REDACTED]0/9 to the nearest whole number gives [REDACTED].\nThe correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] pita breads.\n"
