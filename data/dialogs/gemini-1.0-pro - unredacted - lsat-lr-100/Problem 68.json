So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.\nQuestion: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners\n  B: whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog\n  C: whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city\n  D: whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood\n  E: whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly assumed that the most important factor in evaluating the argument was the likelihood of cocker spaniels straying. However, the key factor is whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods. If residents of Flynn Heights are less likely to license their dogs, then the argument is weaker. This is because the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights may not be a reliable indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in the neighborhood.\nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding the key issue\n- Focusing on irrelevant information\n- Ignoring important information\nSolution:\nThe argument is based on the premise that if a stray cocker spaniel is found near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. This premise is based on the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined.\nTo evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods. If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then the argument is stronger. This is because the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights is a more reliable indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in the neighborhood.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the key issue in the argument.\n2. Determine what information would be most useful in evaluating the argument.\n3. Consider all of the answer choices and choose the one that provides the most relevant information.\n4. Be sure to consider all of the factors that could affect the argument, both positive and negative.\n5. Do not focus on irrelevant information or make assumptions that are not supported by the evidence.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n- Identify the key issue in the argument.\n- Determine what information would be most useful in evaluating the argument.\n- Consider all of the answer choices and choose the one that provides the most relevant information.\n- Be sure to consider all of the factors that could affect the argument, both positive and negative.\n- Do not focus on irrelevant information or make assumptions that are not supported by the evidence.\n"
