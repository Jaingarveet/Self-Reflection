        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet.\n  B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.\n  C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon.\n  D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.\n  E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Explanation:\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the immediate cause of Pluto's status change (ejection from Neptune's orbit) rather than the underlying defining characteristic of a true planet. \n## Error Keywords:\n* **Misinterpretation of the argument's core:** I mistakenly focused on the event of ejection instead of the broader definition of a planet.\n* **Logical fallacy:** I committed the \"post hoc ergo propter hoc\" fallacy, assuming that because Pluto was ejected, that event caused its status change, when in reality, the cause was likely its formation outside of the solar system.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the conclusion:** Pluto is not a true planet.\n2. **Analyze the reasoning:** The argument hinges on Pluto's formation and ejection from Neptune's orbit.\n3. **Examine the answer choices:**\n    * A is irrelevant, as the argument doesn't discuss moons becoming planets.\n    * B is partially correct but doesn't address the formation aspect.\n    * C focuses on the consequence of ejection, not the defining characteristic.\n    * D is irrelevant, as the argument doesn't discuss size.\n    * **E directly addresses the formation requirement, making it the key assumption.**\n4. **Therefore, the correct answer is E.**\n## Instructions for future similar problems:\n1. **Focus on the core argument and its underlying assumptions, not just the immediate cause-and-effect relationships.**\n2. **Carefully analyze each answer choice and its relation to the argument's logic.**\n3. **Beware of logical fallacies and ensure your reasoning is sound.**\n4. **Consider alternative explanations and potential counter-arguments.**\n## General advice for similar problems:\n* **Read the question and answer choices carefully.**\n* **Identify the key issue and the underlying assumptions.**\n* **Break down complex arguments into smaller, easier-to-analyze components.**\n* **Apply relevant legal principles and concepts.**\n* **Consider potential counter-arguments and strengthen your reasoning.**\n* **Double-check your analysis and ensure your conclusion logically follows from the premises.**\n"
