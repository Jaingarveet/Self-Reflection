Morgenstern: The only risk in quitting is that of not finding another job. If you don't find one, you're going to be pretty unhappy. But you're already unhappy, so you might as well just quit.\nQuestion: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it\nChoices:\n  A: fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance\n  B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true\n  C: mischaracterize what Brooks says\n  D: conllates two different types of risk\n  E: reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the specific risks Morgenstern mentioned rather than the broader issue of the argument's structure. \nMy error was in not recognizing the flawed assumption underlying Morgenstern's reasoning.\nError Keywords:\n - Flawed assumption\n - False dilemma\n - Oversimplification\nSolution:\nMorgenstern's argument is flawed because it fails to consider the varying degrees of unhappiness. \nEven if Brooks is already unhappy, quitting could lead to a more significant or intense unhappiness if they are unable to find a new job.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the main argument being made.\n2. Analyze the underlying assumptions of the argument.\n3. Determine whether the assumptions are valid or flawed.\n4. Consider alternative possibilities and potential consequences.\n5. Evaluate the argument's overall strength and validity based on its assumptions and potential outcomes.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the structure of arguments and identify any underlying assumptions.\n - Evaluate the validity of assumptions and consider alternative possibilities.\n - Recognize that arguments can be flawed even if they contain some element of truth.\n - Be cautious of arguments that oversimplify complex issues or present false dilemmas.\n - Consider the potential consequences of different courses of action before making a decision.\n"
