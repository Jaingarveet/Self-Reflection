        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Explanation:\nMy initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the variability of individual allergies rather than the variability of cat proteins. While it's true that different people react to different proteins, the passage emphasizes that **not all cats have the same protein composition in their skin and saliva**. This directly implies that **cats themselves differ in their allergy-triggering potential**.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the focus of the passage, emphasizing individual allergies instead of cat protein variability.\n* **Overgeneralization:** I overgeneralized the statement about individual allergies to conclude that all cats are equally allergenic.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the key point:** The passage highlights the **variation in protein composition among cats**.\n2. **Analyze the answer choices:** Only option C directly reflects this variation.\n3. **Eliminate other options:**\n    * A: This might be true, but the passage doesn't provide evidence.\n    * B: While true, it's a weaker statement than C, which directly addresses the protein variation.\n    * D: The passage doesn't discuss the intensity of reactions.\n    * E: This is true due to individual differences, but not the main point.\n## Instructions for Future:\n1. **Focus on the main point of the passage, not just specific details.**\n2. **Carefully analyze each answer choice and eliminate those that don't directly address the key point.**\n3. **Consider the scope of the information provided and avoid making assumptions beyond the text.**\n## General Advice:\n* **Read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.**\n* **Identify the key issue or question being addressed.**\n* **Analyze each answer choice critically and eliminate those that are irrelevant or contradict the information.**\n* **Don't rush to answer; take your time to understand the context and implications.**\n* **Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.**\n"
