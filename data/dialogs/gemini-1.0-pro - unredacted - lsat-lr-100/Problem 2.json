This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nQuestion: If the above statements are true, which one of the following statements must also be true?\nChoices:\n  A: This year, most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n  B: Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n  C: Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films.\n  D: This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.\n  E: This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Explanation:\nMy initial reasoning was sound, but I failed to consider all implications of the given information. While it's true that some films winning prizes at international festivals were Canadian, the prompt doesn't guarantee that **all** such films were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, the possibility exists that a film could win a prize at Lac Nichoutec without being shown internationally.\n## Error Keywords:\n* Incomplete analysis\n* Overlooking possibilities\n* Jumping to conclusions\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify key facts:**\n    * Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.\n    * Most films winning prizes at Lac Nichoutec also won prizes internationally.\n2. **Analyze implications:**\n    * This implies some films winning prizes internationally are Canadian.\n    * However, it doesn't guarantee all such films were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\n3. **Evaluate answer choices:**\n    * Only option D aligns with this analysis: some Lac Nichoutec winners might not have been shown internationally.\n## Instructions for future:\n1. **Read carefully and identify key facts.**\n2. **Analyze all implications of the information provided.**\n3. **Consider all answer choices and eliminate those contradicted by the information.**\n4. **Choose the answer that best aligns with the logical deductions.**\n## General advice:\n* **Be cautious of drawing conclusions based on limited information.**\n* **Consider all possibilities and potential exceptions.**\n* **Don't rush to judgment; carefully analyze the information before choosing an answer.**\n* **Focus on logical reasoning and deduction, not just keyword matching.**\n"
