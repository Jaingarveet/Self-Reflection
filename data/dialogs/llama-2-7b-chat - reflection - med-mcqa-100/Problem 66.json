Thank you for pointing this out.\n\nThe correct answer for the question \"Hepatitis A virus shedding in faeces is\" is indeed (D) Two weeks before the symptoms and two weeks thereafter.\n\nThe Hepatitis A virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals for a period of time before and after the onset of symptoms. The exact duration of virus shedding in the feces can vary depending on the individual and the stage of infection, but it is generally estimated to be around 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions."
