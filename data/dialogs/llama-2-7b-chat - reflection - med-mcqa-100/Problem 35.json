Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The other options, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), atrial septal defect (ASD), and transposition of the great arteries (TGA), are less likely given the patient's age and symptoms.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misinterpretation of chest X-ray findings\n* Lack of knowledge in pediatric cardiology\nSolution:\nThe chest X-ray of the neonate shows a large VSD, indicating that the patient has a congenital heart defect.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Evaluate the chest X-ray for any abnormalities.\n2. Identify the type of congenital heart defect based on the chest X-ray findings.\n3. Use your knowledge of pediatric cardiology to determine the most probable diagnosis.\n4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always thoroughly evaluate the patient's medical history and symptoms before making a diagnosis.\n* Use your knowledge of pediatric cardiology to identify the type of congenital heart defect based on the chest X-ray findings.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that a chest X-ray is just one tool used to diagnose a congenital heart defect, and other diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis."
