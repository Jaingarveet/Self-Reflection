Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is important for the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and other physiological processes. A deficiency in tryptophan can lead to these clinical features.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misidentification of deficiency\n* Lack of knowledge about tryptophan deficiency\n* Incorrect interpretation of clinical features\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is (A) Tryptophan.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the clinical features described in the question.\n2. Consider the possible causes of each clinical feature.\n3. Evaluate the likelihood of each cause based on the information provided.\n4. Choose the most likely cause as the answer.\n5. Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the choices.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always thoroughly evaluate the clinical features and possible causes before making a decision.\n* Use a systematic approach to identify the most likely cause of the clinical features.\n* Stay up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge and research in the field of social and preventive medicine.\n* Practice critical thinking and decision-making skills to improve your accuracy in diagnosis."
