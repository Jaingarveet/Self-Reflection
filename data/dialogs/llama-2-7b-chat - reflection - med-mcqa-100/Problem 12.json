Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, the question is actually asking about the requirement of aminoacyl tRNA for the translation of any amino acid, and the correct answer is Hydroxylysine.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question\n* Confusion with specific amino acids\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.\n2. Break down the question into smaller parts and identify the key concepts involved.\n3. Use your knowledge of biochemistry to determine the correct answer.\n4. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the amino acid that is not required to be translated with an aminoacyl tRNA.\n2. Use your knowledge of biochemistry to determine the correct answer.\n3. Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.\n* Always use your knowledge of biochemistry to determine the correct answer.\n* Always double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that aminoacyl tRNA is required for the translation of all amino acids during protein synthesis."
