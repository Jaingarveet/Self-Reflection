Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, the correct answer is D: Branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the termination point of the facial artery\n* Confusion between the facial artery and the opposite side of the facial artery\n\nSolution:\nThe facial artery is a branch of the carotid artery that supplies blood to the face. It terminates in the anastomosis with the branch of the ophthalmic artery, not the opposite side of the facial artery.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the origin of the facial artery (branch of the carotid artery).\n2. Identify the destination of the facial artery (anastomosis with the branch of the ophthalmic artery).\n3. Double-check your understanding of the facial artery's course and termination point.\n4. Use the information provided in the question to determine the correct answer.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and understand the anatomy of the relevant structures before answering a question.\n* Take your time and double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\n* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or images, to help you understand the anatomy and terminology of the facial artery.\n* Practice using different question types and scenarios to improve your knowledge and confidence in anatomy and medicine."
