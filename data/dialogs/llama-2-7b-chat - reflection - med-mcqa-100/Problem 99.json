However, the acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct, which is the final part of the nephron where the urine is concentrated and prepared for excretion.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Loop of Henle\n* Collecting duct\n* DCT\n* PCT\n\nSolution:\nThe principal site of acidification of urine is the collecting duct in the kidney.\nThe collecting duct is the part of the nephron where the urine is concentrated and prepared for excretion.\nThe acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct through the action of hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the part of the kidney where acidification of urine occurs.\n2. Understand the process of acidification of urine in the collecting duct.\n3. Recall the correct answer, which is the collecting duct.\n4.
