Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Medicine\nSubtopic: ENT\nQuestion: 60-year-old male complaints of right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood tinged. Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?\nChoices:\n  A: Rhinoscleroma\n  B: Wegener's granulomatosis\n  C: Stewa's granuloma\n  D: Rhinosporidiosis\n\n  Thought: The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of nasal polyps.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - Wegener's granulomatosis.\n\nRationale: Nasal polyps are non-cancerous growths that can occur in the nasal passages and can cause nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and bleeding. The biopsy findings of the patient show evidence of chronic inflammation and granuloma formation, which are common features of Wegener's granulomatosis. This condition is an autoimmune disorder that affects the blood vessels in the nose and sinuses, leading to inflammation and the growth of polyps.\n\nIt is important to note that the other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings. Rhinoscleroma is a rare fungal infection that can cause nasal polyps, but it is not typically associated with bleeding. Stewa's granuloma is a rare condition that can cause nasal polyps and bleeding, but it is more commonly associated with a history of nasal trauma. Rhinosporidiosis is a rare parasitic infection that can cause nasal polyps, but it is not typically associated with bleeding.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Nasal polyps are non-cancerous growths that can occur in the nasal passages and cause nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and bleeding. The biopsy findings of the patient show evidence of chronic inflammation and granuloma formation, which are common features of nasal polyps.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Review the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings to determine the correct diagnosis.\n2. Consider the possibility of nasal polyps as a diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.\n3. Evaluate the patient for other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as rhinoscleroma, Stewa's granuloma, or rhinosporidiosis.\n4. Consult with a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist), to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\nAdvice:\n\n* Always thoroughly evaluate the patient's symptoms and medical history to ensure an accurate diagnosis.\n* Consider all possible diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.\n* Consult with specialists when necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\n* Always double-check your reasoning and conclusions to ensure accuracy."
