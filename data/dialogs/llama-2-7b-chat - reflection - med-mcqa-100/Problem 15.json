Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": " Explanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question as D: Cholesteatoma, when in fact the commonest cause for grommet insertion is A: Secretory otitis media.\n\nSecretory otitis media is the most common indication for grommet insertion, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases. Cholesteatoma, on the other hand, is a less common cause for grommet insertion, accounting for around 20% of cases.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the indication for grommet insertion\n* Confusing cholesteatoma with secretory otitis media\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Review the definition of secretory otitis media and its symptoms.\n2. Understand the common indications for grommet insertion.\n3. Recognize the difference between secretory otitis media and cholesteatoma.\n4. Use the correct formula to calculate the product of the number of letters in the name of the condition and the number of letters in the name of the symptom.\n5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review and refresh your knowledge of medical conditions and their symptoms.\n* Pay close attention to the question and ensure you understand the context and indications for grommet insertion.\n* Use a systematic approach to solve the problem, breaking it down into smaller steps.\n* Double-check your calculations and ensure accuracy.\n* Stay up-to-date with the latest medical knowledge and guidelines."
