Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, ALP (Alanine Aminotransferase) is an enzyme produced by the liver, but it is not secreted into the bloodstream. AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) is also an enzyme produced by the liver, but it is not secreted into the bloodstream. ALT (Alanine Transaminase) is an enzyme produced by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the question\n* Confusing similar terms\n* Lack of knowledge in biochemistry\n\nSolution:\n\n1.
