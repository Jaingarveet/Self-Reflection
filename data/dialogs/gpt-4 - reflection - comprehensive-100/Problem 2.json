I should have stated my answer as 'Action: Answer(\"E\")' instead of explaining my answer in a paragraph.\nError Keywords:\n - Formatting error\n - Answer submission error\nSolution:\nThe length of the fence is composed of the width of the pickets and the space between them. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, and since there are (x-1) spaces between x pickets, the total space between the pickets is 6(x-1) inches. So, the total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1). To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). First, simplify the equation: 1/2x + 6(x-1) = 1/2x + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6. Then, convert to feet by dividing by 12: (6.5x - 6) / 12 = 13x/24 - 1/2 = (13x - 12) / 24. So, the answer is E: (13x - 12) / 24.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the components that make up the total length of the fence (width of pickets and space between them).\n2. Calculate the total width of the pickets.\n3. Calculate the total space between the pickets.\n4. Add the total width of the pickets and the total space between them to get the total length in inches.\n5. Convert the total length in inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n6. Simplify the equation if necessary.\n7. Provide your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer(\"[ANSWER_CHOICE]\")'.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember to provide your answer in the correct format."
