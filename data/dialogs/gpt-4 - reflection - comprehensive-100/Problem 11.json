Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the logic behind the assertion. I focused on the alternative explanation provided in option D, rather than looking for the option that most directly contradicts the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. \nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logic error\n- Assertion contradiction\nSolution:\nThe assertion is that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. \nOption B is the most doubtful of this assertion because it shows a situation where housing prices increased significantly (7.2%) while the increase in land prices was minimal (0.37%). This contradicts the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the assertion made in the question.\n2. Evaluate each option in relation to the assertion.\n3. Look for the option that most directly contradicts the assertion.\n4. The option that shows a significant difference in the correlation implied by the assertion is the most doubtful.\nAdvice:\n- Always understand the assertion or claim made in the question.\n- Evaluate each option in relation to the assertion, not in isolation.\n- Look for contradictions to the assertion in the options.\n- The option that most directly contradicts the assertion is the most doubtful.\n- Don't be distracted by alternative explanations that don't directly address the assertion."
