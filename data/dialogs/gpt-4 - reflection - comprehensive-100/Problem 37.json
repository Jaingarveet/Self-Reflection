Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nThought: \nThe passage states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva, which can provoke allergic reactions. However, the specific proteins that cause these reactions vary among allergy sufferers. This means that a given cat may cause an allergic reaction in some people but not in others. Therefore, it is impossible to predict whether a specific cat will cause an allergic reaction in a particular person.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

I focused on the variability of allergic reactions among individuals, rather than the variability of proteins among cats.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Reading comprehension error\n- Focus error\nSolution:\nThe passage states that people who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva. The specific proteins responsible for the allergic reactions vary among individuals. This implies that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the passage carefully and understand the information provided.\n2. Identify the key points in the passage.\n3. Understand the question and what it is asking.\n4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the passage.\n5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the passage and question carefully.\n- Focus on understanding the key points in the passage.\n- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the passage, not based on assumptions or external knowledge.\n- Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage, even if other answer choices may seem plausible."
