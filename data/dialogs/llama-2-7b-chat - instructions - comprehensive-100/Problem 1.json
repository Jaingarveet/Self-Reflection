I need to reevaluate the problem and find the correct solution.\n\nReflection:\n\nTo find the monthly sales required for the shop assistant to earn a monthly salary of $1500, we need to use the given information:\n\n* The fixed salary of $500\n* The percentage of sales that is 5% of all monthly sales\n\nWe can start by calculating the fixed salary:\n\n$500 (fixed salary) + 5% of monthly sales = monthly salary\n\nWe know that the monthly sales are the sum of all sales made by the shop during a month. Let's call this amount X.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n$500 + 5% of X = $1500\n\nTo find X, we can solve for it by subtracting $500 from both sides of the equation:\n\n5% of X = $1000\n\nX = $20,000 (round up to the nearest thousand)\n\nTherefore, the monthly sales required for the shop assistant to earn a monthly salary of $1500 are $20,000.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
