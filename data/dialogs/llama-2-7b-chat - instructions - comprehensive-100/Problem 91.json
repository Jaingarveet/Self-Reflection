However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is B: Benzoyl peroxide.\n\nComedonal acne is a type of acne that occurs when dead skin cells and oil clog pores. Benzoyl peroxide is an effective treatment for comedonal acne as it helps to kill the bacteria that can cause clogged pores and reduce inflammation. Topical antibiotics, on the other hand, are more effective in treating inflammatory acne, which is characterized by redness and swelling.\n\nTherefore, based on my self-reflection, the correct answer is B: Benzoyl peroxide.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
