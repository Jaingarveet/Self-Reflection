The analogy suggests that just as a painting requires a solid foundation to succeed, education also requires a strong foundation in the fundamentals of a subject to build upon. Therefore, option B is the most logical completion of the editorial's argument.\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is actually option E: the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience.\n\nExplanation: The editorial emphasizes the importance of proper preparation in both painting and education. In painting, the surface must be properly prepared before applying the primer coat. Similarly, in education, the student's initial educational experience sets the foundation for their future success. The editorial suggests that a strong foundation in the fundamentals of a subject is crucial for students to make progress and achieve their full potential. Therefore, option E is the most logical completion of the editorial's argument.\n\n[REDACTED]"
