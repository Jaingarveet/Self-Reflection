Here is my reflection:\n\nI misunderstood the problem and thought that the ages were in arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months. However, the problem states that the ages are in A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, which means that the ages are not necessarily consecutive.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, I should have calculated the sum of the ages of all the members and then divided it by the common difference to find the number of members in the club.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
