I will carefully evaluate the expression and determine the possible values of $c$.\n\nReflection:\n\n1. $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$\n2. $a+b=8$\n\nTo find the possible values of $c$, I will factor the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n$(a x+2)(b x+7)=(ax+2)(bx+7)=a x b + 2 b x + 7 a + 7 b$\n\nNow, I can equate the expression to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$:\n\n$a x b + 2 b x + 7 a + 7 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$\n\nSimplifying the equation, I get:\n\n$a b + 2 b + 7 a + 7 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$\n\n$a + 2 b + 7 a + 7 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$\n\n$9 a + 14 b = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$\n\n$c = 15 x^{2} - 14 b - 9 a$\n\nNow, I need to find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ such that $c$ takes on the values $3$ and $5$.\n\nSolution:\n\nLet $a = 2$ and $b = 3$. Then, $a + 2 = 8$, which gives $a = 6$. Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, I get:\n\n$c = 15 x^{2} - 14 (6) - 9 (2) = 15 x^{2} - 84$\n\nSo, the possible values of $c$ are $3$ and $5$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
