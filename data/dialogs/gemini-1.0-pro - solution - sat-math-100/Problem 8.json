The total amount she paid to the cashier was $p$ dollars, including an 8 percent sales tax on the discounted price. Which of the following represents the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ ?\nChoices:\n  A: $0.88 p$\n  B: $\\frac{p}{0.88}$\n  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$\n  D: $\\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nLet x be the original price of the computer.\nAfter a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x.\nAn 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.\nWe are given that the final price is p dollars, so 0.864x = p.\nTo isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.\nThe original price of the computer is p / 0.864, which can be written as p / (0.8)(1.08).\n"
