I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* I initially chose the wrong answer because I did not pay close attention to the table.\n* I assumed that the shipping charge increased by a constant amount for each additional pound of merchandise.\n* However, the table shows that the shipping charge increases at a **non-constant rate**.\n* The correct answer is the function that models this non-constant rate of change.\n**Solution:**\nTo find the correct function, we can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation:\n```\ny = mx + b\n```\nwhere:\n* `y` is the dependent variable (shipping charge)\n* `x` is the independent variable (merchandise weight)\n* `m` is the slope\n* `b` is the y-intercept\nWe can find the slope by calculating the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight:\n```\nm = (51.59 - 16.94) / (40 - 5) = 0.99\n```\nWe can find the y-intercept by substituting one of the points from the table into the slope-intercept form and solving for `b`:\n```\n16.94 = 0.99 * 5 + b\nb = 11.99\n```\nTherefore, the function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge is:\n```\nf(x) = 0.99x + 11.99\n```\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
