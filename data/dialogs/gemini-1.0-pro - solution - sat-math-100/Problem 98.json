I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* I initially made a mistake by not solving the system of equations correctly.\n* I did not isolate the variables properly and made an arithmetic error.\n* I did not check my answer to ensure it was correct.\n**Solution:**\nTo solve the system of equations, we can use the elimination method. Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get:\n$$\\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\\\6 y-3x=-57\\end{array}$$\nAdding the two equations, we eliminate $x$ and get:\n$$10y=-80$$\nDividing both sides by 10, we get:\n$$y=-8$$\nSubstituting $y=-8$ into the first equation, we get:\n$$3x+4(-8)=-23$$\n$$3x-32=-23$$\n$$3x=9$$\n$$x=3$$\nTherefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x, y) = (3, -8)$.\n**Action:** Answer(\"B\")"
