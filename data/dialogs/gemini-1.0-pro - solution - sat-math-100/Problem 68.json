The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution must he use?\nChoices:\n  A: 5\n  B: 25\n  C: 50\n  D: 100\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\nThe equation can be simplified to $0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$.\nCombining like terms, we get $0.02x=0.02y$.\nDividing both sides by 0.02, we get $x=y$.\nSince Clayton uses [REDACTED] milliliters of the $20 \\%$ by mass saline solution, he must also use [REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution.\nHowever, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: 2[REDACTED].\nThis is because the equation $x=y$ only tells us that the amount of the $10 \\%$ solution is equal to the amount of the $20 \\%$ solution, but it does not tell us the actual value of x or y.\nTo find the actual value of x, we can substitute y=[REDACTED] into the equation $0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$.\nThis gives us $0.10x+0.20([REDACTED])=0.18(x+[REDACTED])$.\nSimplifying this equation, we get $0.10x+20=0.18x+18$.\nCombining like terms, we get $0.08x=2$.\nDividing both sides by 0.08, we get $x=2[REDACTED]$.\nTherefore, Clayton must use 2[REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \\%$ by mass saline solution.\n"
