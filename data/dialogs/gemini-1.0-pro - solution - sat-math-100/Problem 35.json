This was incorrect because I did not consider the possibility that $x$ could be negative.\n**My reflection on the problem:**\nThe problem asks for all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation. This means that we need to find all values of $x$ that make the equation true. In order to do this, we need to solve the equation for $x$.\n**My reflection on my solution:**\nMy solution was incorrect because I did not consider the possibility that $x$ could be negative. I made this mistake because I was not careful enough when I was solving the equation. I need to be more careful in the future and make sure that I consider all possible values of $x$.\n**My reflection on the correct answer:**\nThe correct answer is that the only value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is 1. This is because when we solve the equation for $x$, we get $x = 1$. This is the only value of $x$ that makes the equation true.\n## Solution\nTo solve the equation $\\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$, we can square both sides of the equation. This gives us:\n$$4 x = (x-3)^2$$\nExpanding the right side of the equation, we get:\n$$4 x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$\nMoving all the terms to the left side of the equation, we get:\n$$x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$$\nFactoring the left side of the equation, we get:\n$$(x-1)(x-9) = 0$$\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are $x = 1$ and $x = 9$. However, we need to check these solutions to make sure that they are valid.\nIf we substitute $x = 1$ into the original equation, we get:\n$$\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 1} = 1-3$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$2 = -2$$\nThis is not true, so $x = 1$ is not a valid solution.\nIf we substitute $x = 9$ into the original equation, we get:\n$$\\sqrt{4 \\cdot 9} = 9-3$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$6 = 6$$\nThis is true, so $x = 9$ is a valid solution.\nTherefore, the only value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 9$.\n## Answer\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
