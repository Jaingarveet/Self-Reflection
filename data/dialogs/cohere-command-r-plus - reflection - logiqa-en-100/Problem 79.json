Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: There must be an outside world, because if there is something outside me that can shine or reflect, shining the light into my eyes, which gives me a visual experience, I ca nâ€™t see the buildings, the crowds and the stars these things.And, not only have visual experience like me, but others also have such visual experience; book knowledge also tells us repeatedly that there is an outside world outside of us.\nQuestion: Which of the following does not constitute doubt or rebuttal to the above argument?\nChoices:\n  A: To use sensory evidence to explain the existence of the external world requires presupposing the existence of the external world in the mind.\n  B: How do you prove that others have similar visual experience to you?\n  C: Since the visual experience is reliable, Mirage is not a so-called illusion, but a real existence.\n  D: If there is no external world and natural science knowledge is not a true reflection of it, then why does natural science achieve such great success in practice?\n\nThought: \nChoice A questions the validity of using sensory evidence to prove the existence of an external world, which is a doubt about the argument.\nChoice B questions how we can know that others share similar visual experiences, which does not rebut or doubt the argument.\nChoice C asserts that visual experiences are reliable and that mirages are real, which does not doubt or rebut the argument but rather supports the idea that sensory evidence is valid.\nChoice D brings up the practical success of natural science, which relies on the assumption of an external world, and suggests that this success supports the existence of that world. This does not constitute doubt or rebuttal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation: \nI misinterpreted the meaning of \"rebuttal\" and \"doubt\" in the context of the question. \nI focused too narrowly on the concept of \"visual experience\" and its reliability, rather than considering the broader argument about the existence of an external world and the role of natural science in supporting or refuting this claim. \nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Narrow focus\n - Ignoring broader context\nSolution: \nThe argument claims that an external world exists because of our visual experiences and the success of natural science.\n\nChoice A: This statement questions the validity of using sensory evidence, implying that the existence of an external world is already assumed in the mind. It does not directly support or align with the argument and can be seen as a doubt or rebuttal.\n\nChoice B: Questioning how we know that others share similar visual experiences does not directly refute the argument's claim about the existence of an external world. It is a valid point but does not constitute a strong doubt or rebuttal.\n\nChoice C: Affirming the reliability of visual experiences and claiming that mirages are real does not rebut or doubt the argument. It supports the idea that sensory evidence is valid.\n\nChoice D: This choice brings up a critical point. It questions why natural science has achieved success if there is no external world for it to reflect and operate upon. This choice directly challenges the argument's claim that natural science supports the existence of an external world. Therefore, it does not constitute doubt or rebuttal.\n\nThe correct answer is, indeed, choice D.\n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the argument presented and identify its key claims and evidence.\n2. Interpret what it means for a choice to \"constitute doubt or rebuttal\" to the argument.\n3. Analyze each choice:\n   - A: Consider if it questions or challenges the argument's assumptions or conclusions.\n   - B: Assess if it directly refutes the argument's claim or raises a significant doubt.\n   - C: Evaluate if it aligns with or supports the argument's reasoning.\n   - D: Examine if it offers an alternative explanation or challenges the argument's core premise.\n4. Recognize that a rebuttal or doubt should directly engage with and challenge the argument's central claim or evidence.\n5. Avoid narrow interpretations and consider the broader implications and connections.\n\nAdvice: \n - Always read and understand the argument and the question thoroughly.\n - Carefully interpret the specific requirements of the question, such as \"doubt\" or \"rebuttal.\"\n - Consider all choices and evaluate them critically and independently.\n - Avoid narrow focus; consider the broader context and implications of the argument and choices.\n - Recognize that doubts or rebuttals should directly challenge or question the argument's core claims or evidence."
