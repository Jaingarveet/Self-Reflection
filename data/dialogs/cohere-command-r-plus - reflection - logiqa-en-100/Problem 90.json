Identify the relationship between economic development and enterprise competitiveness. \n2. Recognize the relationship between social stability and the establishment of social security systems. \n3. Understand the impact of paying social insurance premiums on enterprise competitiveness. \n4. Recognize the inherent contradiction between the country's goals and strategies. \n5. Conclude that the country cannot maintain both economic development and social stability as presented. \nAdvice: \n - Carefully analyze the relationships and dependencies presented in the context. \n - Look for contradictions or inherent conflicts within the given information. \n - Recognize that improving one aspect at the cost of another indicates an unsustainable strategy. \n - Understand the impact of external factors, such as social insurance premiums, on the system as a whole. \n - Always consider the potential for trade-offs and their long-term implications."
