Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation: \nI misinterpreted the sentence structure and its logical implications. I focused too narrowly on the negative construction and missed the main idea. Choice B is the correct answer as it introduces a new concept of \"giving,\" which is not implied by the original statement.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overinterpretation\n- Narrow focus\n- Ignoring main idea\n\nSolution: \nConfucius's statement, \"Do not do what you don't want to be done to others,\" implies a principle of reciprocity and empathy. It suggests that one should avoid imposing unwanted actions or treatments on others, as one would not want those actions done to themselves.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the original statement: \"Do not do what you don't want to be done to others.\"\n2. Identify the key idea: avoiding imposing unwanted actions on others.\n3. Analyze each choice for logical connections to the original statement:\n\nA. This choice suggests that only those who do as they please can impose their actions on others. This is not an accurate inference as the original statement does not specify a causal relationship.\n\nB. Choice B introduces the idea of \"giving it to others,\" which is not implied by the original statement. It shifts the focus to providing something desirable, rather than avoiding unwanted actions.\n\nC. This choice is a direct application of the original statement, changing the structure to a positive form. It captures the core idea of the original statement.\n\nD. This choice reflects a misinterpretation. The original statement is about avoiding unwanted actions, not about ensuring that all actions are desired by others.\n\n4. Recognize that Choice B introduces a new, unrelated concept and, therefore, is not a logical inference.\n\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and the main idea of the original statement.\n- Look for direct applications or restatements of the idea.\n- Avoid overinterpreting or introducing new concepts not implied by the original statement.\n- Stay focused on the logical connections between the original statement and the choices.\n- Practice analyzing and identifying logical relationships to improve accuracy."
