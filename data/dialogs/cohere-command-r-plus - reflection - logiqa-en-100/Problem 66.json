Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation: \nI overlooked the fact that the islands could be arranged in more than two ways due to the flexibility in the relative positions of islands E, F, and H. My reasoning was too narrow, and I missed the correct answer.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Insufficient consideration\n- Lack of flexibility\n- Overlooked possibilities\n\nSolution: \nGiven that G is the northernmost island and F is adjacent to H, we can determine that G, F, and H must appear in that order from north to south. However, the relative positions of E and I can vary, leading to multiple possible arrangements:\n\n1. G, F, H, E, I\n2. G, F, E, H, I\n3. G, F, H, I, E\n4. G, E, F, H, I\n\nThus, there are four possible arrangements, matching choice C.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the given conditions and fixed arrangements from the statements.\n2. Recognize that the relative positions of the remaining islands can vary.\n3. List all possible arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.\n4. Count the number of valid arrangements to determine the final answer.\n\nAdvice:\n- Consider all given conditions and fixed arrangements as a starting point.\n- Look for flexibility or variability in the remaining elements.\n- Explore all possible arrangements by varying the movable elements while keeping the fixed elements in place.\n- Avoid making assumptions or limiting yourself to a single arrangement without exploring all possibilities.\n- Always double-check your interpretations and the validity of each arrangement."
