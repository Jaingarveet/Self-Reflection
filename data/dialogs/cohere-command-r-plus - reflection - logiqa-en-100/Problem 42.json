Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Aptripa Cave is located near the bay of Dilos in the Peninsula of Maina, and is as large as four football fields.This cave dates back to the Neolithic Age, but was not accidentally discovered by a man walking a dog until the 1950s.After decades of scientific research work, archaeologists excavated tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils from the cave, and thus believed that hundreds of people had lived in the cave.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, can best refute the above argument?\nChoices:\n  A: The cave inspired the description of hell in Greek mythology\n  B: The cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue\n  C: There is no prehistoric village in Europe that has been found earlier than the cave\n  D: The entrance to the cave collapsed 5000 years ago\n\nThought: \nThe argument is that Aptripa Cave was inhabited by a large number of people in the Neolithic Age because various artifacts and utensils were found there.\n\nChoice D states that the entrance to the cave collapsed 5,000 years ago. This directly contradicts the argument's timeline, as the Neolithic Age ended around 2,000 BCE, which is less than 5,000 years ago. If the entrance collapsed earlier, the artifacts could have accumulated after the cave was no longer inhabited, or they could have been placed there by people who accessed the cave through other means.\n\nTherefore, Choice D is the best option to refute the argument.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation: \nI misinterpreted the question and chose an answer that contradicted the argument's timeline, rather than its main conclusion. I focused on the date of the cave's inhabitation, ignoring the key point about the number of inhabitants. The correct answer, Choice B, refutes the argument's conclusion by suggesting an alternative explanation for the presence of artifacts without disputing the timeline.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Red herring\n - Timeline confusion\n - Conclusive assumption\n\nSolution: \nThe argument concludes that Aptripa Cave was inhabited by a large number of people during the Neolithic Age because various artifacts and utensils were discovered there. Choice B refutes this conclusion by providing an alternative explanation: the cave could have been a cemetery and funeral venue. This alternative interpretation suggests that the artifacts and utensils might have accumulated over time due to funeral practices, rather than indicating a large number of inhabitants.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument's conclusion: a large number of people inhabited the cave during the Neolithic Age.\n2. Recognize the argument's key premise: the presence of artifacts and utensils suggests habitation.\n3. Understand the question: identify which choice refutes the argument's conclusion.\n4. Evaluate each choice: consider how it affects the argument's conclusion.\n5. Select the choice that provides an alternative explanation for the presence of artifacts, refuting the original conclusion.\n6. Ensure that your selected choice specifically addresses the argument's conclusion, not a peripheral detail.\n\nAdvice:\n - Focus on the argument's conclusion and key premises when evaluating the choices.\n - Recognize and avoid red herrings that distract from the central issue.\n - Ensure that your selected choice directly refutes the argument's conclusion, not a peripheral detail.\n - Consider alternative explanations that challenge the argument's interpretation of the evidence.\n - Stay objective and avoid making assumptions or filling in gaps with your own conclusions."
