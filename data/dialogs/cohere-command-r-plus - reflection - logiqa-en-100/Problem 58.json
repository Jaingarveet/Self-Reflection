        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: In recent years, China's housing prices have risen rapidly.In the fourth quarter of 2004, various government departments issued a number of measures to suppress the excessively rapid growth of housing prices, but national housing prices continued to rise in the first quarter of 2005.It was asserted that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.\nQuestion: Which of the following, if true, is the most doubtful of an assertion?\nChoices:\n  A: Shanghai's housing prices in the first quarter of 2005 increased by 19.1% over the same period last year, and land prices rose by 6.53%.\n  B: Residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, and residential land prices rose by 0.37%.\n  C: The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.\n  D: The chairman of Yongtai Development Company said? \"The skyrocketing housing prices are because supply has not kept up with demand.\"\n\nThought: \nThe argument claims that rising land prices are the main driver of soaring housing prices. To cast doubt on this assertion, we should look for evidence that housing prices can rise independently of land prices. \n\nChoice A provides data showing that Shanghai's housing prices rose more sharply than land prices, which weakens the argument's claim. This choice is the most effective at raising doubt about the assertion.\n\nAnswer: The correct answer is \"A\".\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation: \nI focused on the magnitude of the increase in housing prices relative to land prices, rather than the relationship between the two. I overlooked the fact that the argument is about the causal link between land prices and housing prices.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Data analysis error\n- Causal relationship error\n\nSolution: \nThe argument asserts a causal link between rising land prices and soaring housing costs. To cast doubt on this claim, we should seek evidence that suggests an alternative or additional factor influencing housing prices. \n\nChoice B provides information about Beijing, where housing prices rose only slightly while land prices increased minimally. This indicates that housing prices can rise even when land prices remain relatively stable, suggesting other factors are at play. Thus, choice B effectively raises doubt about the assertion.\n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the argument: Rising land prices lead to soaring housing prices. \n2. Identify the key claim: A causal relationship between land and housing prices. \n3. Recognize the task: Seek evidence that casts doubt on the causal link. \n4. Analyze each choice: Assess if it suggests factors beyond land prices impacting housing costs. \n5. Identify the best choice: Choose the option that most strongly implies alternative influences on housing prices. \n\nAdvice: \n- Focus on the argument's key claim and the logical connection it asserts. \n- Ensure you understand the precise relationship being argued. \n- Recognize that data can be misleading if interpreted solely based on magnitude rather than relationship. \n- Consider alternative factors and their potential influence on the situation. \n- Always read and analyze each choice carefully, ensuring your interpretation aligns with the information presented."
