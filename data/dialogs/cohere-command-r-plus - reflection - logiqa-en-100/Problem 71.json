Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the contradiction in the survey results.\n2. Understand that the options provide potential reasons for this contradiction.\n3. Analyze each choice to determine its relevance to resolving the contradiction. \n4. Recognize that choice C addresses the discrepancy between favorable views and actual hiring intentions.\n5. Interpret the statistical insights correctly:\n - 69% (favor) vs. 31% (better service) reveals a disconnect.\n - People like the idea, but not for superior service.\n6. Understand that choice C provides the most reasonable explanation for the contradiction.\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and identify the central contradiction or problem.\n- Recognize that each option presents a potential resolution to the contradiction.\n- Analyze each choice critically, focusing on its relevance to the central issue.\n- Interpret statistical insights and percentages correctly and in the context of the problem.\n- Ensure that you understand the underlying motivations and perceptions of the respondents."
