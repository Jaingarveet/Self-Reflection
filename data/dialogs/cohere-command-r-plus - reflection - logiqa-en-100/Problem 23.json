Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the argument's assumption and focused on the relationship between loneliness and artistic achievement, rather than the relationship between achievement and happiness. I overlooked the key link between achievement and happiness, which is the core of the argument's assumption.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Oversight\n- Assumption error\n\nSolution: The argument claims that great painters often lack intimate relationships, which contradicts the theory linking happiness to such relationships. Therefore, the argument assumes that artists who achieve greatness in their field cannot be unhappy, even without intimate relationships. This assumption bridges the gap between artistic achievement and happiness, which is the crux of the argument's reasoning.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument's premise: the link between happiness and intimate relationships.\n2. Recognize the argument's counter-example: great painters often lack such relationships.\n3. Understand the argument's assumption: despite the lack of intimate relationships, great painters cannot be unhappy.\n4. Connect artistic achievement to happiness: the assumption links achievement and inner fulfillment.\n5. Choose the answer reflecting this connection: artists with great achievements cannot be unhappy.\n\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and premises of the argument.\n- Identify any counter-examples or opposing viewpoints presented.\n- Recognize the gap in reasoning that the argument aims to fill.\n- Look for connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, such as artistic achievement and happiness.\n- Consider the underlying assumptions and implications of the argument.\n- Avoid focusing solely on one aspect of the argument; consider all elements and their relationships."
