Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the main claim in the argument: The Internet has made it possible for people, even in less economically developed regions, to satisfy their material desires through online shopping.\n2. Understand what the question is asking: Which choice contradicts or challenges this argument?\n3. Analyze each choice:\n - Choice A discusses increased taxes and fees, which is irrelevant to the argument's main point.\n - Choice B mentions physical stores, but the argument is about the impact of the Internet on regions with low economic development.\n - Choice C acknowledges a limitation of online shopping, but it does not refute the argument's main claim.\n - Choice D contradicts the argument by stating that satisfaction depends solely on economic development, disregarding the role of the Internet.\n4. Choose the answer that most directly challenges the argument: Choice D.\nAdvice:\n - Focus on the central claim of the argument and the specific context provided.\n - Identify red herrings or irrelevant information that distracts from the main point.\n - Ensure that your chosen answer directly challenges the argument's core claim.\n - Avoid selecting answers that are tangentially related or only partially address the argument."
