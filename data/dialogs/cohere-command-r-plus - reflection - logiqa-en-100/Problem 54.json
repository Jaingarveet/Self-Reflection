Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Read and understand the context provided, including the original problem and the changed problem.\n2. Identify the key difference between the two problems. \n3. Recognize that the new problem focuses on striving for excellence and how it changes the evaluation criteria.\n4. Evaluate each choice based on its explanation of this shift in evaluation criteria.\n5. Choose the answer that best reflects the changed perspective on what constitutes \"good\" and \"bad\" in the industry.\nAdvice:\n- Ensure you thoroughly understand the context and the specific details provided. \n- Focus on the nuances conveyed in the choices, especially how each choice interprets the change in the problem. \n- Consider the broader implications of the changed problem and how it might impact various aspects of the industry. \n- Avoid choosing answers that are too narrow or broad; look for a balanced interpretation that captures the essence of the change. \n- Always relate your interpretation back to the specific details provided in the question."
