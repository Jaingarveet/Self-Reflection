Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6.

Identify the argument's conclusion: to understand the true face of the emperor, one must read Ye Shi.\n2. Determine the gap in information: why is Ye Shi necessary if the official history is the emperor's diary?\n3. Analyze the options: which choice fills this gap and provides the missing link?\n4. Evaluate each choice: does it provide a valid reason for the argument's conclusion?\n5. Double-check your interpretation: does the chosen assumption align with the argument's logic?\nAdvice:\n- Understand the context and identify the argument's conclusion.\n- Look for gaps in information or unstated premises.\n- Analyze each option critically and fill in those gaps.\n- Ensure that the chosen assumption logically supports the argument's conclusion.\n- Avoid personal interpretations or biases; focus on the information provided."
