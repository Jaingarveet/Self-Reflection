Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation: I misinterpreted the meaning of \"raising doubts.\" I focused on directly contradicting the expert opinion and overlooked the aspect of providing alternative explanations for the number decline. My error was in the logical interpretation of the question.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Interpretation error\n- Logical error\n- Misunderstanding\n\nSolution: \nThe correct answer is B. Choice B provides an alternative explanation for the decline in salamander numbers, suggesting that a change in rainfall and groundwater levels has affected their water source environment. This raises doubts about the expert opinion that trampling by cattle and sheep is the primary cause of the decline.\n\nInstructions: \n1. Understand the question: Identify what the question is asking for, which is to find the option that raises the most doubts about the experts' opinions.\n2. Interpret the context: Understand the information provided, including the experts' opinions on the decline of the northern salamander population in Xinjiang.\n3. Analyze each choice: \nA) Supports the experts' opinion and local protection efforts, does not raise doubts.\nB) Provides an alternative explanation for the population decline, unrelated to trampling, and raises doubts about the sole blame on trampling.\nC) Describes the salamander's behavior, which does not directly contradict the expert opinion or provide an alternative explanation for the decline.\nD) Discusses tourist access, which is irrelevant to the expert opinion on trampling.\n\n4. Evaluate and select: Choice B provides new information that could explain the decline and casts doubt on the exclusivity of the trampling hypothesis.\n\nAdvice: \n - Understand the precise meaning of the question, especially when dealing with logical or critical thinking problems.\n - Consider multiple interpretations and nuances of the provided information.\n - Evaluate each choice objectively and independently, avoiding confirmation bias.\n - Look for options that provide alternative explanations or introduce new factors that could influence the conclusion.\n - Avoid choosing answers that directly support or oppose a statement without providing additional relevant information."
