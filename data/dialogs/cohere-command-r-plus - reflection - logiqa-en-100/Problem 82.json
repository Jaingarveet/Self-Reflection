Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. \nI focused on the classification of the house as a \"small property house\" but overlooked the impact of its legal status on the argument. \nThe correct answer, Choice D, introduces doubt about the legal status of similar houses, which weakens the conclusion that this specific house is not protected by law.\n\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation\n - Overlooking details\n - Ignoring legal context\n\nSolution:\nThe argument concludes that a newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law because it is a \"small property house,\" and all small-property houses are not subject to registration and legal protection.\n\nChoice B directly contradicts the classification of the house as a \"small property house.\" However, this does not weaken the argument. Even if the house is not a \"small property house,\" the argument's conclusion remains valid because it relies on the lack of legal protection for such houses.\n\nChoice D introduces new information that some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses. This information weakens the argument because it suggests that the legal status of \"small property houses\" is not clear-cut. If some newly built houses in the same village are not considered \"small property houses\" and may be protected by law, then the conclusion that all such houses are automatically unprotected is questionable.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conclusion and premises of the argument.\n2. Understand the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n3. Analyze each choice:\n   - Choice A: Tacit approval does not impact the legal status of the house.\n   - Choice B: Misinterpreted the impact of classification on the argument.\n   - Choice C: Building location is already established in the context.\n   - Choice D: Introduces doubt about the legal status of similar houses.\n4. Recognize that Choice D weakens the argument by questioning the clear-cut nature of legal status.\n\nAdvice:\n - Carefully analyze the structure of the argument and the relationships between its components.\n - Consider the impact of each choice on the argument's conclusion.\n - Look for options that introduce doubt, contradict key premises, or provide alternative explanations.\n - Recognize that weakening an argument is not the same as disproving it or providing a counter-argument.\n - Focus on the specific details and nuances presented in each choice."
