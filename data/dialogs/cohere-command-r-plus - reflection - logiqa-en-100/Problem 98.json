Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: Right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two things.There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not wrong in themselves, such as laws in certain countries that prohibit criticism of the government; there may also be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong, such as laws that require apartheid in public places.And, like evaluating behavior, we can also evaluate some of the prescribed right and wrong.\nQuestion: Which of the following does not weaken, but supports the argument in the question stem?\nChoices:\n  A: If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?\n  B: \"People are doing, heaven is watching.\" Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.\n  C: Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.\n  D: The basis for judgment of right and wrong lies in pushing oneself and one's moral conscience.It is common and universal; however, the moral regulations on how to act for people vary from person to person and from place to place.\n\nThought: \nThe argument in the question stem is about the relationship between rules/regulations and judgments of right and wrong. Choice C directly supports this by stating that judgments of right and wrong are based on underlying rules/standards.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

Understand the argument's focus on the relationship between rules/regulations and judgments of right and wrong.\n2. Recognize the argument's acknowledgment of varying rules and their potential misalignment with intrinsic morality.\n3. Interpret each choice in the context of the argument's broader themes.\n4. Identify which choice emphasizes the intrinsic and universal nature of moral conscience while acknowledging varying regulations.\n5. Select the choice that aligns with the argument's exploration of the complex interplay between rules and morality.\nAdvice:\n- Read the argument and choices attentively, grasping their underlying themes and nuances.\n- Consider the broader context and potential implications of the argument.\n- Avoid overly literal interpretations; look for connections and underlying principles.\n- Recognize the role of moral relativity and individual conscience in ethical judgments.\n- Understand that rules and regulations are societal constructs that may evolve and vary across cultures.\n- Approach these problems holistically, considering the interplay of various factors."
