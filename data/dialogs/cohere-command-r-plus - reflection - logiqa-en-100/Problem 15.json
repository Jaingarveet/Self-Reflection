Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Identify the type of argument presented (deductive, inductive, or abductive).\n2. Recognize that the argument is not purely deductive, as it involves probabilistic reasoning.\n3. Understand that the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it.\n4. Consider alternative scenarios or conditions that could affect the conclusion.\n5. Choose the answer that reflects the probabilistic nature of the argument.\nAdvice:\n - Be cautious when dealing with arguments and their conclusions. \n - Recognize the difference between deductive, inductive, and abductive arguments, and their implications for the relationship between premises and conclusions. \n - Understand that in probabilistic arguments, the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it. \n - Always consider alternative explanations or conditions that could impact the conclusion. \n - Practice analyzing arguments to improve your critical thinking and reasoning skills."
