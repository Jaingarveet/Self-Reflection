Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misinterpreted the structure of the original argument and failed to identify the correct choice that reflected the same logical structure. I focused too narrowly on the specific words used in each statement rather than the underlying logical structure. \n\nError Keywords:\n- Logical structure\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overly literal interpretation\n\nSolution:\nThe original argument can be structured as follows:\nPremise 1: All landscape rooms (A) can see the landscape (B).\nPremise 2: Li Wenbing's family (C) cannot see the landscape (not B).\nConclusion: Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room (not A).\n\nThis argument follows the form: All A are B; C is not B; therefore, C is not A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the correct choice, D:\nPremise 1: Anyone who meets the basic conditions (A) can apply for a small loan (B).\nPremise 2: Sun Wen (C) did not apply for a small loan (not B).\nConclusion: Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions (not A).\n\nChoice D follows the same logical structure as the original argument:\n- \"Anyone who meets the basic conditions\" is analogous to \"All landscape rooms.\"\n- \"Can apply for a small loan\" is analogous to \"can see the landscape.\"\n- \"Sun Wen\" is analogous to \"Li Wenbing's family.\"\n- \"Did not apply for a small loan\" is analogous to \"cannot see the landscape.\"\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the structure of the original argument:\n   - Premise 1: All A are B.\n   - Premise 2: C is not B.\n   - Conclusion: Therefore, C is not A.\n2. Analyze each choice:\n   - Look for the same logical structure: All A are B; C is not B; therefore, C is not A.\n   - Choice A is about respect and kindness, which do not match the structure.\n   - Choice B is about cheap vegetables, but it does not follow the A, B, and C structure.\n   - Choice C is about employees and English speaking abilities, but it does not follow the argument form.\n   - Choice D follows the structure: Anyone who meets conditions (A) can apply for a loan (B). Sun Wen (C) didn't, so they lack conditions (not A).\n3. Choose the answer that matches the structure.\n\nAdvice:\n- Focus on the logical structure and relationships between statements rather than specific words or examples.\n- Identify the key elements of the argument: the universal statement (\"All A are B\"), the negative statement about an individual (\"C is not B\"), and the conclusion (\"Therefore, C is not A\").\n- Look for these elements in the answer choices, and select the one that mirrors this structure.\n- Practice identifying logical structures to improve your ability to recognize them quickly and accurately."
