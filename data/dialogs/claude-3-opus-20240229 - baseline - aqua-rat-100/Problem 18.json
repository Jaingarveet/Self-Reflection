(100 - 30% of 100 = 70)\n3) Now, we need to find the percentage increase needed to go from 70 units back to the original 100 units.\n4) The increase needed is 100 - 70 = 30 units.\n5) To calculate the percentage increase, we divide the increase by the current price and multiply by 100:\n   \n   Percentage increase = (Increase / Current Price) * 100\n                       = (30 / 70) * 100\n                       = 0.4286 * 100\n                       = 42.86%\nTherefore, the price should be increased by approximately 42.86% to return to the original price.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
