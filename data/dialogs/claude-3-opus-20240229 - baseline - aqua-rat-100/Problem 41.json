After 4 friends didn't show up, each person's contribution became (96/(x-4)) + 4.\n4. Since the total amount spent remains the same, we can equate the two:\n   x * (96/x) = (x-4) * ((96/(x-4)) + 4)\n5. Simplifying:\n   96 = 96 + 4(x-4)\n   96 = 96 + 4x - 16\n   16 = 4x\n   x = 4\n6. So, initially there were 4 + 4 = 8 friends planning to attend the picnic.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
