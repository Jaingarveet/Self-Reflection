        "content": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1) The cube has a side length of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. This means the hollow part has a side length of 3cm (5cm - 2 * 1cm).\n2) The total number of 1cm cubes in a 5cm cube is 5^3 = 125.\n3) The number of 1cm cubes in the hollow part is 3^3 = 27.\n4) So, the number of 1cm cubes that make up the hollow cube is 125 - 27 = 98.\n5) Each 1cm cube has 6 faces. So, the total number of faces of the 1cm cubes is 98 * 6 = 588.\n6) The outer surface of the big cube consists of 5 * 5 * 6 = 150 faces of the 1cm cubes.\n7) Therefore, the number of faces of the 1cm cubes that remain unpainted is 588 - 150 = 438.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
