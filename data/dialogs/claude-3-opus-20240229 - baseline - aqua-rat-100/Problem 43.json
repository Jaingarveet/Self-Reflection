We can write an equation:\n   S = 500 + 0.05x\n3. We want to find x when S = 1500. So, let's substitute 1500 for S:\n   1500 = 500 + 0.05x\n4. Subtract 500 from both sides:\n   1000 = 0.05x\n5. Divide both sides by 0.05:\n   1000/0.05 = x\n   20000 = x\nTherefore, the monthly sales should be $20000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
