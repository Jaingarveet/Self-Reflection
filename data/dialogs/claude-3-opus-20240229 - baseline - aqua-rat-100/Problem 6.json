Find the portion of a house each painter can paint in a day:\n   - Mr. Brown: 1/6 house per day\n   - Mr. Black: 1/8 house per day\n   - Mr. Blue: 1/12 house per day\n2. In the first 8 days, Mr. Brown paints:\n   - 8 × (1/6) = 4/3 houses\n3. In the next 6 days, Mr. Black paints:\n   - 6 × (1/8) = 3/4 house\n4. Total houses painted by Mr. Brown and Mr. Black:\n   - 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 houses\n5. Number of houses left for Mr. Blue to paint:\n   - 3 - 25/12 = 11/12 house\n6. Time taken by Mr. Blue to paint the remaining:\n   - 11/12 ÷ (1/12) = 11 days\nTherefore, it will take Mr. Blue 11 days to complete the contract.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
