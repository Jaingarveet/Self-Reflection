We are given that the average of H and L is x:\n   (H + L)/2 = x\n2) The sum of all scores in the class is zy, since y is the average score and there are z students.\n3) If we remove the highest and lowest scores, the sum of the remaining scores would be zy - H - L.\n4) The number of remaining students after removing the highest and lowest scorers is z - 2.\n5) The average of the remaining scores is the sum of the remaining scores divided by the number of remaining students:\n   (zy - H - L)/(z - 2)\n6) We can substitute H + L with 2x based on the information from step 1:\n   (zy - 2x)/(z - 2)\nThis matches choice D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
