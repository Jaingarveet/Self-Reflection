The age difference between you and your brother is 2 - 1 = 1 year.\n3. This age difference will always remain the same.\n4. Now, you are 60 years old. To find your brother's age, we subtract the age difference from your current age:\n   \n   Your brother's age = 60 - 1 = 59 years old\nTherefore, your brother is 59 years old now.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
