He has a total of 5 tablets to take.\nTo find the total time, we can calculate:\n* Time between each tablet = 15 minutes\n* Number of intervals between tablets = Number of tablets - 1 \n   * Because for 5 tablets, there are 4 intervals: \n     * 1st tablet -> 15 min -> 2nd tablet -> 15 min -> 3rd tablet -> 15 min -> 4th tablet -> 15 min -> 5th tablet\nSo, number of intervals = 5 - 1 = 4 intervals\nTotal time = Number of intervals × Time between each tablet\n            = 4 × 15 minutes\n            = 60 minutes\nTherefore, it will take Roy 60 minutes to consume all 5 tablets.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
