        "content": "Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let's say the original square cloth had a side length of x feet.\n2. After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions of x feet by (x - 4) feet.\n3. This rectangle is cut diagonally to form two triangles. Each triangle has a base of x feet and a height of (x - 4) feet.\n4. We're told that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height\n5. Substituting the values:\n   70 = (1/2) * x * (x - 4)\n   140 = x^2 - 4x\n   x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0\n6. This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n   x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n   Here, a = 1, b = -4, c = -140\n7. Solving:\n   x = [4 ± √(16 + 560)] / 2\n   x = [4 ± √576] / 2\n   x = [4 ± 24] / 2\n   x = 14 or -10\n8. Since the side length can't be negative, x must be 14.\n9. The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4 times the side length. So, the perimeter is 4 * 14 = 56 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
