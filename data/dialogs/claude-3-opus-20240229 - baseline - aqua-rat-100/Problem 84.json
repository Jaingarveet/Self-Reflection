This means that Susan and Tim can't be in the same position relative to each other.\n2) Given this, there are two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim:\n   - Susan, Tim, Zen\n   - Susan, Zen, Tim\n3) In each of these arrangements, the positions of Susan and Tim are fixed relative to each other, but Zen's position can vary.\n4) So, for each of these two arrangements, there is only one way to arrange the children.\n5) Therefore, there are a total of 2 ways to arrange the children while keeping Susan to the left of Tim.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
