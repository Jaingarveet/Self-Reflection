His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.\nWe know that when rowing against the current, the effective speed is the difference between the rowing speed and the current speed. So:\n4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed\n   2 = 4 - x\n   x = 4 - 2 = 2\nSo, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.\nNow, when rowing along the current, the effective speed is the sum of the rowing speed and the current speed. So:\n5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed\n                             = 4 + 2 = 6\nTherefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
