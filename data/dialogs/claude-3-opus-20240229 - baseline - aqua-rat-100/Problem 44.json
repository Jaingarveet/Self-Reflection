First, let's calculate the total man-days required to complete the work:\n   * 8 men work for 6 days\n   * Total man-days = 8 × 6 = 48 man-days\n2. Now, we need to find how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day:\n   * Let the required number of men be x\n   * Since the total man-days must remain the same:\n     x men × 1/2 day = 48 man-days\n     x × 1/2 = 48\n     x = 48 ÷ 1/2 = 48 × 2 = 96\nTherefore, 96 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
