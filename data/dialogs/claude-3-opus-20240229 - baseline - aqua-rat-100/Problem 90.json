The total cost for a week is $210. This includes the cost for Sunday and the other 6 days.\nWe can set up an equation:\n- Cost of Sunday papers: 2x * $4 = $8x\n- Cost of weekday papers: 6x * $1 = $6x\n- Total cost: $8x + $6x = $210\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   $14x = $210\n5. Solve for x:\n   x = $210 / $14 = 15\nTherefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
