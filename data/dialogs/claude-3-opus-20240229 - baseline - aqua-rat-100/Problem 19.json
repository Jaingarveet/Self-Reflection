In the forward journey, Distance = Speed × Time\n   So, x = y × 6 ...(Equation 1)\n3. In the return journey, the speed is (y + 12) km/hr.\n   So, x = (y + 12) × 4 ...(Equation 2)\n4. From Equation 1: y = x/6\n   Substituting this in Equation 2:\n   x = (x/6 + 12) × 4\n   x = 2x/3 + 48\n   x - 2x/3 = 48\n   x/3 = 48\n   x = 48 × 3 = 144\nTherefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
