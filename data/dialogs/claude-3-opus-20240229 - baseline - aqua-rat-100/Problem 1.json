This is because the diagonal connects two opposite vertices, which are on the surface of the sphere.\n3) We can find the diagonal using the 3D Pythagorean theorem:\n   diagonal^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2\n4) Simplifying:\n   diagonal^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 = 250\n5) Taking the square root of both sides:\n   diagonal = sqrt(250) = 5 * sqrt(10)\n6) Now, let's compare this value with the given choices. We can see that 5 * sqrt(10) is approximately equal to 15.8113.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
