According to the question, when 30 is subtracted from x, it becomes one-third of x.\n   Mathematically, x - 30 = x/3\n3. Solve the equation:\n   x - 30 = x/3\n   3x - 90 = x\n   2x = 90\n   x = 45\n4. So, the original number is 45.\n5. The question asks for 50% of 45.\n   50% of 45 = 0.5 Ã— 45 = 22.5\nTherefore, the correct answer is 22.5.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
