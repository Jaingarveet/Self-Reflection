        "content": "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. Last year, the store sold an average of 42 microwave ovens per month for 12 months.\n   - Total microwaves sold last year = 42 × 12 = 504\n2. This year, in the first 10 months, the store sold an average of 20 microwave ovens per month.\n   - Total microwaves sold this year = 20 × 10 = 200\n3. Total microwaves sold over the entire 22 month period:\n   - 504 (last year) + 200 (this year) = 704\n4. To find the average over the 22 month period, divide the total by 22:\n   - 704 ÷ 22 = 32\nTherefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 month period is 32.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
