To calculate the commission for one sale:\n   * Commission = 10% of $250\n   * 10% is equivalent to 0.1\n   * Commission = 0.1 ร $250 = $25\n4. The salesperson wants to reach a salary of at least $1000.\n5. To find the number of sales needed, divide the target salary by the commission per sale:\n   * Number of sales = Target salary รท Commission per sale\n   * Number of sales = $1000 รท $25 = 40\nTherefore, the salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
