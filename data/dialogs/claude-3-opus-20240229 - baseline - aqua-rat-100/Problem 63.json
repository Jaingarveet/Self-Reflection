Find the total number of matches played.\n2. Calculate 30% of the total matches.\nStep 1: Find the total number of matches\n* Let the total number of matches be x.\n* The number of matches won is 20, which is 70% of the total matches (100% - 30% lost = 70% won).\n* So, 20 = 0.7x\n* x = 20 / 0.7 ≈ 28.57\nSince the number of matches must be a whole number, we round 28.57 to 29.\nStep 2: Calculate 30% of the total matches\n* 30% of 29 = 0.3 × 29 = 8.7\n* Rounding to the nearest whole number, the team lost 9 matches.\nAmong the given choices, the closest answer is D: 7.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
