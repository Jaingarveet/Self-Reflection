Let's represent these numbers as: \n   (n-4), (n-2), n, (n+2), (n+4), where n is an odd number.\n2) The sum of these numbers is:\n   (n-4) + (n-2) + n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 5n\n3) We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. \n   In other words, 5n/10 = n/2 is a perfect square.\n4) For n/2 to be a perfect square, n must be an even number. But we know that n is an odd number (given in the question). \n   The only way for an odd number divided by 2 to be a perfect square is if the odd number itself is a perfect square.\n5) So, n must be an odd perfect square. The odd perfect squares are: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, ...\n6) Now, we need to check which of the given options, when substituted for n, makes all 5 numbers two-digit numbers.\n   If n = 9, the numbers are 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 (not all two-digit numbers).\n   If n = 25, the numbers are 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 (all two-digit numbers).\n   If n = 49, the numbers are 45, 47, 49, 51, 53 (all two-digit numbers).\n   If n = 81, the numbers are 77, 79, 81, 83, 85 (all two-digit numbers).\n7) Among the given options, 47 is present in the series when n = 49.\nTherefore, 47 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
