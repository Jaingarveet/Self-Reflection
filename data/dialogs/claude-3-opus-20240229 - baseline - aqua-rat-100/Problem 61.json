Kevin's speed from A to B is 70 mph, so the time taken for this part of the journey is x/70 hours.\n3. Kevin's speed from B to A is 90 mph, so the time taken for this part of the journey is x/90 hours.\n4. The total journey time is x/70 + x/90 hours.\n5. 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B. This means he had 70 miles left to reach B, and then x miles to reach A.\n6. In these 3 hours, he covered 70 miles at 70 mph (which took 1 hour) and x miles at 90 mph (which took x/90 hours).\n7. So, 1 + x/90 = 3\n8. Solving this equation: x/90 = 2, so x = 180\nTherefore, the distance between A and B is 180 miles.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
