This means the elevator travels the remaining steps in 10 minutes.\n2. In the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then the elevator takes you to the bottom in 20 minutes. This means the elevator travels the remaining steps plus the 10 steps you walked in the first scenario in 20 minutes.\n3. From this, we can deduce that the elevator takes 10 minutes to travel the 10 steps that you walked in the second scenario.\n4. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps in 10 minutes, which simplifies to 1 step per minute.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
