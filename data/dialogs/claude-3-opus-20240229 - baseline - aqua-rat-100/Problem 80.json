        "content": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let the number of white sharpeners be x and the number of brown sharpeners be y.\n2. We know that the total number of sharpeners is 18, so x + y = 18.\n3. Let the cost of each brown sharpener be z rupees. Then, each white sharpener costs (z + 1) rupees.\n4. The total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees, so we can write the equation:\n   x(z + 1) + yz = 100\n5. We have two equations:\n   x + y = 18\n   x(z + 1) + yz = 100\n6. Substituting y = 18 - x in the second equation:\n   x(z + 1) + (18 - x)z = 100\n   xz + x + 18z - xz = 100\n   x + 18z = 100\n7. We can't solve this equation further as we have two unknowns (x and z). However, we can try the given options to see which one satisfies the equation.\n8. Trying option A: 10 white and 8 brown sharpeners\n   10 + 18z = 100\n   18z = 90\n   z = 5\n   Each brown sharpener costs 5 rupees and each white sharpener costs 6 rupees.\n   Total cost = 10 × 6 + 8 × 5 = 60 + 40 = 100 rupees\n   This satisfies the given conditions.\nNone of the other options satisfy the given conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
