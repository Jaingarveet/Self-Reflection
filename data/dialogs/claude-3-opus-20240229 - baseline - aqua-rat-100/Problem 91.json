This can be represented as +5 on a horizontal axis.\n3. Next, A travels 3 km north. This cancels out the initial 3 km south, so A is now back at 0 on the vertical axis.\n4. Finally, A travels 2 km west. This can be represented as -2 on the horizontal axis.\nSo, A's final position is 0 on the vertical axis (no net north/south movement) and +3 on the horizontal axis (5 km east - 2 km west).\nTo find the straight-line distance from home, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:\ndistance^2 = 0^2 + 3^2\ndistance^2 = 9\ndistance = sqrt(9) = 3\nTherefore, at the end of the journey, A is 3 km away from home.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
