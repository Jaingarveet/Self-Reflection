So at most, 20 of the hardcover books could also be fiction.\n6) However, we need to check if this is possible given the total number of hardcover books. There are 30 hardcover books total, which is more than 20. So it is possible for all 20 fiction books to also be hardcover.\nTherefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 20.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
