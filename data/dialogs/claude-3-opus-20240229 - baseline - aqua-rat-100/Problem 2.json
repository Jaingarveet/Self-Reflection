After adding the truck, the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.\n4. We can set up an equation based on the new average:\n   (12.2 × 10 + x) ÷ 11 = 14.8\n5. Simplify:\n   (122 + x) ÷ 11 = 14.8\n6. Multiply both sides by 11:\n   122 + x = 14.8 × 11\n   122 + x = 162.8\n7. Subtract 122 from both sides:\n   x = 162.8 - 122\n   x = 40.8\nTherefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
