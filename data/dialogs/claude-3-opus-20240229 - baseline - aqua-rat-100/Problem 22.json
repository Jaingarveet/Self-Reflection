        "content": "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n1. Let's assume Jacob made x toys. Then, Alex made (35 - x) toys.\n2. Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, we can set up an equation:\n   7(35 - x) ≈ 9x\n3. Simplify the left side of the equation:\n   245 - 7x ≈ 9x\n4. Add 7x to both sides:\n   245 ≈ 16x\n5. Divide both sides by 16:\n   x ≈ 15.3125\n6. Since x represents the number of toys Jacob made, it must be a whole number. The closest whole number to 15.3125 is 15.\nTherefore, Jacob made approximately 15 toys.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
