Simplify the denominator first:\n   13 × 13 - 156 = 169 - 156 = 13\n3. Multiply both sides by the denominator to isolate the numerator:\n   [5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] = 6 × 13 = 78\n4. Simplify the left side:\n   5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7 = ? × 19 - 17\n5. Add 17 to both sides:\n   ? × 19 = 78 + 17 = 95\n6. Divide both sides by 19:\n   ? = 95 ÷ 19 = 5\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 5.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
