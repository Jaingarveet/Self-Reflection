        "content": "Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:\n1. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. So after the first quarter-mile, you have $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 left.\n2. Each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. To find how many additional quarter-miles you can travel with the remaining $5.00, we divide:\n   \n   $5.00 รท $0.10 per quarter-mile = 50 additional quarter-miles\n3. So in total, you can travel:\n   \n   First quarter-mile + Additional quarter-miles = Total quarter-miles\n   1 + 50 = 51 quarter-miles\n4. To convert quarter-miles to miles, we divide by 4:\n   \n   51 quarter-miles รท 4 = 12.75 miles\nTherefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
