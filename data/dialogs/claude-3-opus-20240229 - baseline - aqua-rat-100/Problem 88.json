So, x = 100 * 10 = 1000 miles.\n3. The train covers 1/4 of the distance (250 miles) at 100 miles/hour. This takes 250/100 = 2.5 hours.\n4. For the remaining 3/4 of the distance (750 miles), the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour due to rain. \n   The time taken to cover this distance is 750/75 = 10 hours.\n5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken for the first 1/4 of the journey and the remaining 3/4 of the journey.\n   Total duration = 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
