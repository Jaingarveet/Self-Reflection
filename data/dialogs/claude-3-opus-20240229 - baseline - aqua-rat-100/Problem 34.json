So, the selling price is 110% of the cost price.\n   27.50 = 110% of x\n   27.50 = 1.1x\n   x = 27.50 / 1.1\n   x = 25\nSo, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.\nNow, if the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, then:\nSelling price = Rs. 25.75\nCost price = Rs. 25\nProfit/Loss % = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price * 100\n             = (25.75 - 25) / 25 * 100\n             = 0.75 / 25 * 100\n             = 0.03 * 100\n             = 3%\nSince the selling price is more than the cost price, it's a profit.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
