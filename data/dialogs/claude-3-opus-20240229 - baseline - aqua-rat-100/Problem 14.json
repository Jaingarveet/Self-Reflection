Find Raj's age 5 years ago:\n   * Raj's age 5 years ago = 17 - 5 = 12 years old\n3. Set up an equation based on the information:\n   * Let Rahim's age 5 years ago be x.\n   * Raj's age 5 years ago was one-third of Rahim's age 5 years ago.\n   * So, 12 = x/3\n4. Solve the equation to find Rahim's age 5 years ago:\n   * 12 = x/3\n   * 12 Ã— 3 = x\n   * x = 36\n   * Rahim was 36 years old 5 years ago.\n5. Find Rahim's current age:\n   * Rahim's current age = Rahim's age 5 years ago + 5\n   * Rahim's current age = 36 + 5 = 41 years old\nTherefore, Rahim is 41 years old now.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
