        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1) If Amy uses only single letters, she would need 10 letters to uniquely code each type of book. But the question suggests we can use pairs of letters too.\n2) If Amy uses only pairs of letters, she would need 5 letters. This is because with 5 letters, there are 10 unique pairs (5C2 = 10).\n3) However, the question asks for the smallest number of letters needed. So we should consider using a mix of single letters and pairs.\n4) Let's say Amy uses 4 letters: A, B, C, and D. With these, she can create 6 unique pairs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Along with the 4 single letters, this gives her 10 unique codes, which is exactly what she needs.\n5) If she used only 3 letters, she could make only 3 single letter codes and 3 pair codes (3C2 = 3), for a total of 6 codes. This is not enough.\nTherefore, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is 4.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
