Let's define some variables:\n   - Let S be the percentage of all students who are in the swim team.\n   - We know that 24% of all students are in both the chess club and swim team.\n   - We also know that 20% of the swim team members are not in the chess club.\n2. If 20% of the swim team are not in the chess club, that means 80% of the swim team are in the chess club.\n3. We can express this as an equation:\n   - 80% of S = 24% of all students\n   - 0.8S = 0.24\n4. Solve for S:\n   - S = 0.24 / 0.8\n   - S = 0.3\n   - S = 30%\nTherefore, 30% of all Daifu students are members of the swim team.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
