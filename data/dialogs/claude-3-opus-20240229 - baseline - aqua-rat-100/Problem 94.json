If the letters need to be distinct, then for the first letter we have 26 choices (assuming we are using the English alphabet), and for the second letter we have 25 choices (because we can't use the same letter again). So, the total number of distinct letter combinations is:\n   26 * 25 = 650\n2) Now, for the numbers, we have 10 choices for each position (0 to 9). The numbers don't need to be distinct, so for two numbers we have:\n   10 * 10 = 100\n3) According to the fundamental counting principle, to find the total number of possible combinations, we multiply the number of choices for each position. So, the total number of distinct bike numbers is:\n   650 * 100 = 65,000\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 65000.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
