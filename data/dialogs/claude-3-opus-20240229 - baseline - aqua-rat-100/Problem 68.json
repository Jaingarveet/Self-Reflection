This means that 11 is the largest number that divides both a and b.\n3) The least common multiple (LCM) of a and b is 7700. This means that 7700 is the smallest number that is divisible by both a and b.\n4) We know that for any two numbers, their product is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. In other words:\n   a * b = GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b)\n5) Substituting the known values:\n   350 * b = 11 * 7700\n6) Solving for b:\n   b = (11 * 7700) / 350\n     = 84700 / 350\n     = 242\nTherefore, the other integer is 242.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
