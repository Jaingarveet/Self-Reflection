Total amount paid back = 12 × Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 378\n4. Interest paid = Total amount paid back - Principal borrowed\n                = Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18\n5. Interest rate = (Interest paid / Principal borrowed) × 100%\n                 = (18 / 360) × 100%\n                 = 0.05 × 100% = 5%\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
