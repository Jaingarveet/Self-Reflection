For making a 20% profit, the selling price should be 120% of the cost price, i.e., 1.2 * 1200 = Rs. 1440\nSo, we can write the equation:\n0.8x = 1440\nSolving for x:\nx = 1440 / 0.8\nx = 1800\nTherefore, the marked price should be Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
