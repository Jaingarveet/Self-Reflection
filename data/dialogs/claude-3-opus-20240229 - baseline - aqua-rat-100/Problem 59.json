Let's say the total number of marbles was Q.\n2. 20 marbles were pulled out, painted black, and put back. So now, the bag has 20 black marbles and (Q-20) white marbles, still totaling Q marbles.\n3. In the second draw, 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black. This represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag.\n4. The percentage of black marbles in the second draw = 1/20 = 5%\n5. If 5% of the marbles are black, and there are 20 black marbles in total, then:\n   20 = 5% of Q\n   20 = 0.05Q\n   Q = 20/0.05 = 400\nTherefore, the bag currently holds 400 marbles in total.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
