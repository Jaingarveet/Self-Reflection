We want to know the distance traveled after 30 seconds, which is half a minute.\n3. In half a minute, the fan will make 300/2 = 150 revolutions.\n4. The point is 10 centimeters from the center, so it travels a circle with radius 10 cm.\n5. The circumference of this circle is 2 * pi * r = 2 * pi * 10 = 20 * pi cm.\n6. In one revolution, the point travels 20 * pi cm.\n7. In 150 revolutions, the point will travel 150 * 20 * pi = 3000 * pi cm.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
