The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:\n   x(4x + 1) = 150\n4. Expanding the equation:\n   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0\n5. Solving this quadratic equation:\n   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0\n   So, x = 15/4 or -10\n   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m\n6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m\n7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length + breadth)\n   = 2(16 + 3.75)\n   = 2(19.75)\n   = 39.5 m\nThe closest option to 39.5 m is 40 m.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
