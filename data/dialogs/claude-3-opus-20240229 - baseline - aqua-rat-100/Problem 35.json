His target monthly income is 6000 Rupees.\nTo find the required monthly sale, let's set up an equation:\n- Let the monthly sale be x Rupees.\n- The commission will be 15% of x, which is 0.15x Rupees.\n- The total monthly income should be 6000 Rupees.\nEquation:\nBase Salary + Commission = Target Monthly Income\n1500 + 0.15x = 6000\nSolving the equation:\n0.15x = 6000 - 1500\n0.15x = 4500\nx = 4500 / 0.15\nx = 30000\nTherefore, the servant should make a monthly sale of 30000 Rupees to reach his target monthly income of 6000 Rupees.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
