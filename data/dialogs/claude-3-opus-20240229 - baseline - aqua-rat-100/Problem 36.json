First, let's find the percentage of vanilla flavored chocolates:\n   - 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored\n   - So, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored\n2. Now, out of these 90% vanilla flavored chocolates, 90% are squashed:\n   - 90% of 90% = 0.9 Ã— 0.9 = 0.81 = 81%\n   - This means 81% of all chocolates are vanilla flavored and squashed\n3. To find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed:\n   - Total vanilla flavored chocolates = 90%\n   - Vanilla flavored and squashed chocolates = 81%\n   - So, vanilla flavored and not squashed chocolates = 90% - 81% = 9%\nTherefore, 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
