Understand the given information:\n   * The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.\n   * Each bag is sold for $100.\n   * The total profit made is $3,000.\n2. Calculate the profit made on each bag:\n   * Profit per bag = 25% of selling price\n   * Profit per bag = 0.25 × $100 = $25\n3. Calculate the number of bags sold:\n   * Total profit = Profit per bag × Number of bags sold\n   * $3,000 = $25 × Number of bags sold\n   * Number of bags sold = $3,000 ÷ $25 = 120\n4. Find the answer among the given choices:\n   * The closest choice to 120 is 120 itself, but it's not available.\n   * The next closest choice is 120 ÷ 3 = 40.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
