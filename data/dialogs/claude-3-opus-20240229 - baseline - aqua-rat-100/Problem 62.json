So, on a windy day, his speed is:\n   15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph\n3. We want to know how far he can travel in 21 minutes at this reduced speed. \n   First, let's convert 21 minutes to hours:\n   21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours\n4. Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time\n   Distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours\n            = 3.85 miles\n5. Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 3.85 miles.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
