B's investment = Rs. 60,000 for (12 - 2) months = 60,000 × 10 = 600,000\n3. C's investment = Rs. 120,000 for x months, and C's share of profit is Rs. 150,000\nNow, the ratio of profits will be the same as the ratio of investments. So:\nA : B : C = 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000x\nWe know C's share is Rs. 150,000 out of the total profit of Rs. 375,000. So:\n120,000x / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) = 150,000 / 375,000\nSolving this equation:\n120,000x = 150,000 × (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) / 375,000\n120,000x = 180,000 + 225,000 + 90,000x\n30,000x = 405,000\nx = 13.5\nSo, C joined 13.5 months after A started the business, or 11.5 months after B joined.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
