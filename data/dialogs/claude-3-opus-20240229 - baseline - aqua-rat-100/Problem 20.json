Let's call this number x.\n3. After the drive, the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.\nLet's set up an equation based on the ratio:\n(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4 / 3\nCross multiply:\n3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)\n192 + 3x = 160 + 4x\nSolve for x:\n192 - 160 = 4x - 3x\n32 = x\nSo, 32 boys and 32 girls joined during the membership drive.\n4. Calculate the total number of members now:\nBoys: 64 + 32 = 96\nGirls: 40 + 32 = 72\nTotal: 96 + 72 = 168\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
