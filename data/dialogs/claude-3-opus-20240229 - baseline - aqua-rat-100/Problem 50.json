Since the plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed, the time taken by the plane to travel x miles is the same as the time taken by the ship to travel the remaining distance (x - 180) miles.\n3. If the ship's speed is y miles per hour, then the plane's speed is 10y miles per hour.\n4. Time taken by ship to travel (x - 180) miles = (x - 180) / y\n5. Time taken by plane to travel x miles = x / 10y\n6. Equating these times:\n   (x - 180) / y = x / 10y\n7. Cross multiply:\n   10x - 1800 = x\n   9x = 1800\n   x = 200\nTherefore, they will meet when the plane has traveled 200 miles from the starting point.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
