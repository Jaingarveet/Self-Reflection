So, major arc AC = 360° - 160° = 200°.\n3) Since B bisects minor arc AC, it also bisects major arc AC.\n   Major arc AB = 200° / 2 = 100°\n4) Minor arc BD is given as 150°.\n5) To find minor arc AD, we need to subtract minor arc BD from major arc AB.\n   Minor arc AD = Major arc AB - Minor arc BD\n                = 100° - 150°\n                = -50°\n6) However, the measure of an arc cannot be negative. This means that D is actually on the major arc AB, not the minor arc AB.\n7) So, to find the actual measure of minor arc AD, we need to subtract minor arc BD from the full circle:\n   Minor arc AD = 360° - 150°\n                = 210°\n8) The closest answer to 210° is 220°.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
