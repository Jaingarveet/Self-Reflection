So effectively, the frog gains 1m (3m - 2m) each day.\n4. To reach the top of the well, the frog needs to climb a total of 30m.\n5. If the frog gains 1m each day, it will take the frog 30 days to climb 30m.\n6. However, on the 30th day, when the frog jumps 3m, it will reach the top of the well and get out. It doesn't need to fall back 2m on the last day.\nTherefore, it will take the frog 29 days to come out of the well.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
