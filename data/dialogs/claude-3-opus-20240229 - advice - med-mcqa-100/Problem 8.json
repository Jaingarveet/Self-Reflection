        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Randomization is a key principle in scientific experiments and clinical trials. The purpose is to minimize bias and confounding factors.\n2. In a randomized experiment, subjects are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. This helps ensure the groups are equivalent and comparable. \n3. The key aspect of randomization is that every subject has an equal probability of being assigned to any given treatment group. The actual group they end up in is determined purely by chance.\n4. Importantly, while the probability is known and equal for all subjects, the actual outcome (which group they are assigned to) is unknown until the randomization occurs. The researchers do not decide the assignments.\n5. Therefore, randomization implies equal (every subject has same probability) and unknown (the actual assignments are due to chance, not known beforehand) chances of being in any particular group.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
