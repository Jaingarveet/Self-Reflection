Young children have thinner, more delicate skin compared to adults. The donor site should have sufficient thickness to allow harvesting without causing damage.\n2. Children are more active and may be prone to accidentally injuring the donor site. The location should be protected and less likely to be disturbed during play or daily activities.\n3. Cosmetic appearance is a long-term consideration. The donor site should be in a less visible area to minimize the appearance of scarring as the child grows.\n4. Of the choices provided, the buttocks and thighs are the two best options for young children. Both have sufficient skin thickness and are less visible than the trunk or upper limbs.\n5. Between the buttocks and thighs, the buttocks are the better choice. They are more protected and less likely to be disturbed during the child's activities compared to the thighs.\nTherefore, considering the specific needs and characteristics of young children, the best site for harvesting split skin grafts is the buttocks.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
