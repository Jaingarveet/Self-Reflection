Without being able to search for or verify this information, I think the most honest and responsible thing for me to do is acknowledge that I do not know the answer.\nRather than guessing between the multiple choice options or trying to reason my way to an answer, I believe it is better to be direct about the gaps in my knowledge on this subject.
