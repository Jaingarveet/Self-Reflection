        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question specifies we are dealing with anaerobic glycolysis. This is key, as the end products differ between aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\n2. In glycolysis, glucose is broken down into two pyruvate molecules. This process generates 2 ATP and 2 NADH.\n3. However, under anaerobic conditions, the cell needs to regenerate NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue. It does this by reducing pyruvate to lactate using the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. This oxidizes NADH back to NAD+.\n4. So in anaerobic glycolysis, the 2 NADH molecules are used to reduce the 2 pyruvate molecules to 2 lactate. The net end products are therefore 2 ATP and 2 lactate (with the NADH being consumed in the process).\n5. Looking at the choices, the answer that correctly represents the end products of anaerobic glycolysis is C: 2 ATP + 2 NADH.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
