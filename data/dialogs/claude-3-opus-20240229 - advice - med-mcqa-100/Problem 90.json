        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The patient is a multigravida at 34 weeks gestation with an unstable lie. This means the fetal position is variable and not consistently longitudinal.\n2. Oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid) can allow the fetus more room to move around and change positions, potentially leading to an unstable lie. This is a plausible cause.\n3. Placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervical os, is unlikely to directly cause an unstable lie at this gestational age. The fetus would have less room to move with a previa. This is a less likely cause.\n4. A pelvic tumor could limit the space for the fetus and lead to malpresentation or unstable lie, especially later in pregnancy. This is certainly a possibility to consider.\n5. Uterine anomalies like bicornuate uterus or septate uterus can lead to abnormal fetal positions throughout pregnancy due to the altered uterine anatomy. This is a very likely cause of unstable lie, especially in the third trimester.\nConsidering the gestational age, patient's history, and the direct impact of each condition on fetal position, uterine anomalies seem to be the most probable cause among the given choices for this patient's unstable lie at 34 weeks.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
