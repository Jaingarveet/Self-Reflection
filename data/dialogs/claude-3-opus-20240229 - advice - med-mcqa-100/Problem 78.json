        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery. It arises in the neck.\n2. It then runs upward and forward, deep to the submandibular gland, to cross the inferior border of the mandible.\n3. On the face, it runs upward and forward, winding around the oral commissure and alongside the nose. \n4. Near the medial canthus of the eye, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery.\n5. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that enters the orbit through the optic canal.\nTherefore, based on tracing the full course of the facial artery from origin to termination, and considering its anatomical relations, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\nThe facial artery terminates by anastomosing with a branch of the ophthalmic artery near the medial canthus of the eye."
