        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The question is asking about the radiologic finding of a \"cobra snake head appearance\". This is a key clue.\n2. Let's consider each answer choice:\nA. Rectocele - This is a herniation of the rectum into the vagina. It would not typically have a \"cobra head\" appearance on imaging.\nB. Ureterocele - A ureterocele is a dilation of the distal ureter as it enters the bladder. On imaging, especially a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), a ureterocele can have a cobra head appearance as the dilated distal ureter protrudes into the bladder.\nC. Posterior urethral valve - This is an abnormal fold of tissue in the posterior urethra in males. While it can cause dilation of the posterior urethra, it would not typically resemble a cobra head. \nD. Bladder tumour - A bladder tumor would appear as a mass or filling defect in the bladder. It would not have the characteristic appearance of a cobra head.\n3. Reflecting on the advice, the \"cobra head sign\" is a fairly specific finding that strongly suggests a ureterocele. The other choices would have different characteristic appearances.\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
