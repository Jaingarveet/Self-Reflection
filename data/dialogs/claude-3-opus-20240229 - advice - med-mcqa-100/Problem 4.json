The question is asking about the recommended daily dosage of iron and folic acid tablets for mothers under the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programme.\n2. Iron and folic acid supplementation is important during pregnancy to prevent anemia and neural tube defects in the developing fetus.\n3. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iron during pregnancy is 27 mg, and for folic acid, it is 600 mcg.\n4. However, in many developing countries, including India, the prevalence of anemia among pregnant women is high. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommends a higher dosage of iron and folic acid supplementation for pregnant women.\n5. The recommended dosage under the National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) for pregnant and lactating women is 60 mg of elemental iron and 500 mcg of folic acid per day for a minimum of 180 days, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy.\nTherefore, based on the given choices and the current recommendations under the MCH programme, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
