        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe patient is a 60-year-old male diagnosed with carcinoma of the right lung. The CECT chest shows:\n- A 5x5 cm tumor in the upper lobe \n- Another 2x2 cm tumor nodule in the middle lobe\nKey considerations:\n- The presence of two separate tumor nodules does not necessarily mean the cancer is unresectable. We need to carefully evaluate the staging details.\n- The tumors are confined to the right lung, with no mention of distant metastases or lymph node involvement. This suggests the cancer may be localized and potentially resectable.\n- In localized non-small cell lung cancer, surgery offers the best chance for cure when feasible.\nGiven the tumor sizes and locations limited to the right lung, surgical resection of the involved lobes (upper and middle) could potentially be curative. A multidisciplinary approach may be optimal, with surgery as the primary treatment modality followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation if indicated based on final pathologic staging.\nTherefore, the best initial treatment modality for this patient is likely surgery.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
