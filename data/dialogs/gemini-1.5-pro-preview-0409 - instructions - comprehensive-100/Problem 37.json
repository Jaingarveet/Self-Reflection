Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\n**Error Analysis:**\nI previously chose **Choice A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.** This was incorrect because the passage emphasizes the individual variability in allergic reactions based on the specific proteins, not on breeds.  The passage states that the proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person, not from breed to breed.\n**Understanding the Passage:**\nThe key points from the passage are:\n*   Cat allergies are caused by proteins in skin secretions and saliva.\n*   The specific proteins causing allergies vary between individuals.\n*   All cats produce these proteins, so no cat is completely hypoallergenic.\n*   A single cat can cause allergies in some people but not others.\n**Correct Answer Reasoning:**\n**Choice B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers** is the most strongly supported statement.  This aligns directly with the passage's information about individual variability in allergy-causing proteins and the fact that all cats produce these proteins.\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
