The number of spaces between pickets is x-1.\n4. The total number of picket-space units is x (pickets) + (x-1) (spaces) = 2x-1.\n5. The total length in inches is 6.5 * (2x-1) = 13x - 6.5 inches.\n6. Converting to feet: (13x - 6.5 inches) / 12 inches/foot = (13x - 6.5)/12 feet.\n7. This expression doesn't match any of the options exactly.
