Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.\nQuestion: The argument requires assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown.\n  B: The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View.\n  C: None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View.\n  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n"

        "content": "## Reflection on Previous Attempt:\n**My previous incorrect answer was:** [REDACTED]\n**The correct answer was:** D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n**Reason for the mistake:** I likely focused on the consequences of the move rather than the necessary preconditions for the argument to be valid. I might have been distracted by information about housing affordability and commute times after the move, overlooking the importance of the baseline situation before the move.\n**Lesson learned:**  Always carefully analyze the structure of the argument and identify the assumptions it relies upon. Pay close attention to the comparison being made and the baseline against which the change is measured. \n**Applying the lesson to the current question:**\nThe argument states that *after* the move, most employees will have a longer commute. This implies that *currently*, their commutes are shorter. Therefore, the assumption is that most employees currently have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
