Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G, H, and at least one other book must be on the bottom shelf. \nA: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F must also be on that shelf, which means there would be more books on the middle shelf than the bottom shelf, contradicting one of the given conditions. \nB: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then H and at least one other book must be on the same shelf, which means there would be more books on that shelf than the top shelf, contradicting one of the given conditions. \nC: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then M and O must also be on that shelf, which means there would be more books on the middle shelf than the bottom shelf, contradicting one of the given conditions. \nD: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then G and at least one other book must be on the same shelf, which means there would be more books on that shelf than the top shelf, contradicting one of the given conditions. \nE: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then L and at least one other book must be on the same shelf, which means there would be more books on that shelf than the top shelf, contradicting one of the given conditions. \nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
