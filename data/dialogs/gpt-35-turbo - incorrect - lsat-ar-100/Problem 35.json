Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?\nChoices:\n  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.\n  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.\n  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.\n  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nNo reflection information provided.\n"

Therefore, Sugar 3 is made on Friday. This means that Sugar 1 is made on Wednesday or Thursday. If Sugar 1 is made on Wednesday, then Peanut Butter 2 and Oatmeal 3 are also made on Wednesday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, Sugar 1 is made on Thursday. This means that Peanut Butter 2 and Oatmeal 3 are made on Wednesday. Now, we can determine the batches of cookies made on each day.\nMonday: At least one batch (either Oatmeal 1, Peanut Butter 1, or Sugar 1)\nTuesday: Oatmeal 2 and Peanut Butter 3\nWednesday: Peanut Butter 2 and Oatmeal 3\nThursday: Sugar 1 and Sugar 2\nFriday: Sugar 3, Oatmeal 3, and Peanut Butter 3\nUsing this information, we can determine which statement could be false.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
