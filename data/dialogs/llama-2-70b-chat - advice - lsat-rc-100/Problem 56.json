Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though \"by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.\" For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this \"underground river\" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.

The passage states that railroads are an example of a business that has characteristics of the Pin Factory, such as increasing returns to scale. However, the passage also states that the economics of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically, which made it difficult for economists to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the reference to railroads serves to illustrate the challenge of mathematically modeling the Pin Factory concept, which is the central idea of the passage.\n\nSelf-Reflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the context of the passage. I thought the reference to railroads was meant to illustrate the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand, which led me to choose answer D. However, upon re-reading the passage, I realized that the reference to railroads was actually meant to illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor, which led me to choose answer B. This mistake taught me the importance of carefully reading the passage and understanding the context in which the reference is made."
