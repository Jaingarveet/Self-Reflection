        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The ethicist argues that if \"love\" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love \"until death do us part\" makes no sense. This is because feelings are not within one's control.\n2. The ethicist then concludes that no one should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings. \n3. For this conclusion to follow logically, there must be an unstated premise or assumption that connects the idea that promises about uncontrollable things make no sense, to the idea that love in wedding vows should not be interpreted as referring to feelings.\n4. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) This is too broad. The argument is specifically about feelings of love, not all feelings.\nB) This fits as an unstated premise, but it's not quite right. The argument is more about how promises should be interpreted, not what promises should be made.\nC) This could work as an assumption, but it's not necessary for the conclusion. Even if there are no other legitimate meanings of love, the conclusion could still follow.\nD) This looks promising. If we assume that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense, then it would follow that love in wedding vows should not be interpreted as referring to uncontrollable feelings.\nE) This is close, but the argument is more about promises making sense, not about promises being possible to keep.\n5. Therefore, the best answer is D. The ethicist's conclusion relies on the assumption that promises should be interpreted in a way that makes sense.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
