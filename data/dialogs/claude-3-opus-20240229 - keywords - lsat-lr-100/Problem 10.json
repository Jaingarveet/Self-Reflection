        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. Mike is trying to justify using Tom's computer without permission by pointing out that Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission. \n2. Mike seems to be relying on a general principle rather than the specifics of computer or bicycle use. The principle is that if someone has used another person's property without permission, it's okay for that person to use the first person's property without permission in return.\n3. Looking at the answer choices, C and D both capture this general principle of reciprocity - that it's acceptable to treat others how they have treated you or others. \n4. Between C and D, D states the principle in more general terms - that it's permissible to treat people similarly to how they have treated others. This matches Mike's reasoning more closely than C, which is specific to using property without permission.\n5. The other choices focus on other aspects like harm, truth-telling, or the blanket statement that using others' possessions without permission isn't always wrong. But none of those capture the core of Mike's justification.\nTherefore, the principle that would most help justify Mike's reasoning is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
