Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of passage\n - Failure to make logical inference \n - Focusing on secondary information\n - Overlooking key details\n"

        "content": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The passage states that the particular proteins responsible for cat allergies vary from person to person. This suggests that a given cat may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not others, depending on which proteins that cat produces and which proteins a particular person is allergic to.\n2. The passage also says there is no such thing as a cat that can't provoke allergic reactions at all, since all cats shed skin and saliva. However, it notes that a specific cat often causes reactions in some, but not all, people with cat allergies.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA is not strongly supported, as the passage focuses on individual cats and people, not cat breeds.\nB matches the information given - any one cat may cause reactions in some allergy sufferers but not others. \nC is possible but not directly stated or implied. The passage doesn't compare proteins between cats.\nD is not mentioned; the passage doesn't discuss reaction intensity.\nE contradicts the idea that a cat often affects some allergy sufferers but not others.\nTherefore, B is the statement most strongly supported by the passage.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
