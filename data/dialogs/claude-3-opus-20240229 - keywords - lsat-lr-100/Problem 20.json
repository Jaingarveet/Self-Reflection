This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable.\nQuestion: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other.\n  B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes.\n  C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.\n  D: Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.\n  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n - Misinterpretation of legal principle\n - Focusing on irrelevant details\n - Ignoring key implications\n - Incorrect legal reasoning\n"

The judge doesn't say anything about overlap between local and national codes.\nB) and C) are also not mentioned or implied by the judge's reasoning. \nD) directly captures the key principle the judge is using - that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance with one of those codes.\nE) while true in general, is too broad and doesn't specifically justify the judge's reasoning here about ignorance not being an excuse.\nTherefore, D is the best answer that most helps justify the judge's reasoning in this specific situation.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
