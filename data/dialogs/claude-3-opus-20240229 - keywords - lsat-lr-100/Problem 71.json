Prints of all works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store. \n3. The museum store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.\n4. Nighthawks is a 20th century work, since the museum only displays 20th century works. But we don't know if it's on loan to the museum or not displayed.\n5. Choice A is incorrect, since the store sells prints of some works like Nighthawks that are not necessarily on loan or in the permanent collection.\n6. Choice B looks correct - the store only sells prints of 20th century works, whether from the permanent collection, on loan, or neither (like Nighthawks).\n7. Choice C is incorrect, as there may be works on loan that don't have prints in the store.\n8. We can't conclude D is true, as we don't know if Nighthawks is on loan. \n9. Similarly, E may be true but is not necessarily true based on the information given.\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B - every print sold in the store is of a 20th century work.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
