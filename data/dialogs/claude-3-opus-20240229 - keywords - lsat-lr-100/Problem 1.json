This means that in most parts, the climate is either dry (good for cacti) or warm (good for orange trees).\n3. If half the country was both humid and cold (A), it would be difficult to grow either cacti or orange trees in those parts. But this contradicts the given information that in most parts, one or the other is easy to grow. So (A) could be false.\n4. If most of the country is hot (B), that aligns with the information that in most parts, it's easy to raise orange trees. So (B) could be true.\n5. If some parts are neither cold nor humid (C), those parts would be suitable for cacti. This fits with the given information. So (C) could be true.\n6. The information doesn't say it's impossible to raise cacti anywhere in the country (D), just that it's difficult in humid areas. So (D) is not necessarily true based on the given information.\n7. If most parts of the country are humid (E), it would be difficult to grow cacti in most parts. But the information states that in most parts, either cacti or orange trees are easy to grow. So (E) must be false.\nTherefore, (E) must be false based on the given information.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
