This year, most (but not necessarily all) of the prize-winning films at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.\nThe question asks which statement must be true based on the given information.\nA: This can't be inferred. We don't know what portion of Canadian films shown at international festivals won prizes at Lac Nichoutec. \nB: We don't have any information about what portion of Canadian films produced this year were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nC: This must be true. If most Lac Nichoutec prize winners also won at international festivals, then at least some of the international prize winners must have been Canadian, since Lac Nichoutec only shows Canadian films.\nD: This isn't necessarily true. It's possible that all Lac Nichoutec prize winners also won at international festivals. The information only says \"most\", not \"some\".\nE: We can't infer this. It's possible that all international prize winners that were Canadian films were shown at Lac Nichoutec.\nThe only statement that must be true is C. The key is that Lac Nichoutec prize winners are necessarily Canadian films, so if most of them won internationally, then some international winners were necessarily Canadian.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
