        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.\nQuestion: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?\nChoices:\n  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.\n  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.\n  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.\n  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.\n  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Misidentified parallel reasoning\n- Overlooked key argument element\n- Risk assessment error\n"

We have two options: A (devote airtime to other genres) or B (stick with classical music only)\n2. If we do B, there is a major risk (going out of business) \n3. We should not take that major risk\n4. Therefore, we should do A\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA: This is the most similar. It presents two options (buy blinds or make curtains). It identifies a major downside to one option (blinds being very expensive). Implicitly, it suggests this downside should be avoided, leading to the conclusion of choosing the other option (make curtains).\nB, C, D, E: These have some similarities in presenting options and downsides, but none of them have the clear pattern of 1) two options 2) one has a major risk 3) avoid that risk 4) do the other option.\nTherefore, A is the best answer, as it most closely mirrors the radio producer's reasoning of choosing one option to avoid a major risk of the other option.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
