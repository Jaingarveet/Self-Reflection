I focused too much on individual constraints rather than considering their combined effect on eliminating options. \n## Solving the Problem:\n1. **Constraint Analysis:**\n    - **H & Y together:** They can be in either Production or Sales, eliminating Public Relations.\n    - **F in Production:** This is a direct constraint.\n    - **F & G not together:** This eliminates G from Production.\n    - **X in Sales -> W in Production:** This is conditional.\n2. **Deductions:**\n    - With F in Production, and H & Y needing to be together, **Production is full (F, H, Y).**\n    - G cannot be in Production, so **G must be in Sales.**\n    - This makes the conditional statement about X and W irrelevant.\n3. **Answering the Question:**\n    - We know G is in Sales. We need to find who is unlikely to be with G.\n    - **H and Y are together in Production, so they cannot be with G in Sales.**\nTherefore, the pair unlikely to be in the Sales department is **H and W**. \nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
