I should have analyzed each option to see if it supports or contradicts the core premise of the external world's existence.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n* **A:** This option directly challenges the argument by pointing out circular reasoning. It argues that using sensory experience to prove the external world already assumes its existence, making it a valid doubt.\n* **B:** This questions the assumption that others share similar visual experiences, casting doubt on the argument's basis.\n* **C:** This statement reinforces the argument by suggesting that visual experiences, even seemingly illusory ones like mirages, are evidence of the external world.\n* **D:** This option supports the argument by highlighting the practical success of natural science, which relies on the existence of an external world to study and explain.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the option that **does not** constitute doubt or rebuttal to the argument is: \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
