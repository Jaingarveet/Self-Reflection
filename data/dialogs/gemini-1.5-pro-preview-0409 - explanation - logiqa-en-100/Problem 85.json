This oversight led me to a conclusion that contradicted the given information.\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Essay E is not used (Statement 4):** This is a crucial starting point. \n2. **Paper K is not used:** Since E implies K (Statement 1), and E is not used, K cannot be used either.\n3. **Paper J is not used:**  Statement (2) tells us G or H excludes J. Since we don't have information to confirm G or H, we can't definitively say they are used, but we know J is definitely not used.\n4. **Possibility of G or H:**  We know J is not used, which opens the possibility of either G or H being used (Statement 2), but we cannot confirm which one or if both are used.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only statement that **must be true** is that paper J is not used, but paper K is also not used. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
