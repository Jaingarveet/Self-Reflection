This violates rule 1 (E or F, but not both) as we would have both F and M. \n* **B: G and J:** This option satisfies rules 2 and 3. We can have E or F (but not both) and H or M (or neither) to complete the team of 4. \n* **C: G and M:** This option implies F is also chosen (due to rule 4). This violates rule 1 (E or F, but not both) as we would have both F and M.\n* **D: H and M:** This option implies F is also chosen (due to rule 4). This violates rule 1 (E or F, but not both) as we would have both F and M.\n## Conclusion:\nOnly option B satisfies all the given conditions without causing any contradictions. \n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
