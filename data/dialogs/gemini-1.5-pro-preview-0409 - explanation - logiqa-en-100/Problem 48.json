I should have analyzed each option to see which one weakens the claim that more and more rich Chinese people are transferring their property abroad.\n## Analysis of Choices:\n* **A:** This option directly contradicts the claim by stating that the number of Chinese buyers hasn't increased, despite the rise in transaction volume. This weakens the argument about more rich Chinese people investing in US real estate. \n* **C:** This option doesn't necessarily refute the argument. It simply provides additional information about the behavior of some wealthy Chinese individuals. \n* **D:** This option actually supports the argument by providing a reason why Chinese investors might choose US real estate. \n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the best argument against the claim is that the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased, despite the rise in transaction volume.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
