I focused too much on the individual statements and failed to analyze the combined implications of all three statements together. This led me to an incorrect conclusion.\n## Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Analyze Professor Zhao's statement:** He states that the champion is neither Tsinghua University nor Zhejiang University. This leaves the possibility of the champion being the China University of Science and Technology team or another team not mentioned.\n2. **Analyze Professor Qian's statement:** He states that the champion is not Tsinghua University but is the China University of Science and Technology team. This statement contradicts Professor Zhao's statement if the champion is indeed the China University of Science and Technology team.\n3. **Analyze Professor Sun's statement:** He states that the champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team but is Tsinghua University. This statement contradicts both Professor Zhao's and Professor Qian's statements.\n4. **Consider the accuracy information:** We know that only one professor got both parts of their prediction correct, one got both parts wrong, and one got one part right and one part wrong.\n5. **Deduce the correct prediction:** Since Professor Sun's statement contradicts both other professors, he must be the one who got both parts wrong. This means the champion is neither Tsinghua University nor the China University of Science and Technology team.\n6. **Identify the winner:** Based on the remaining possibilities and Professor Zhao's statement, the winner must be the **Zhejiang University Team**.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
