I focused too much on the direct connections between locations and failed to consider the chain reactions caused by not visiting I Peak.\n## Deductions from Given Information:\n*   **Not visiting I Peak:** This directly implies **not visiting Lake J** due to condition (4).\n*   **Not visiting Lake J:** Since at least one of Lake G or Lake J must be visited (condition 1), **the group must visit Lake G**.\n*   **Visiting Lake G:** This implies that **the group must have visited either City E or City F** due to condition (2). \n*   **No information about City F:** We cannot determine whether the group visited City F or not based on the given conditions and the fact they didn't visit I Peak.\n## Analyzing Choices:\n*   **A: Incorrect.** We know they didn't visit Lake J.\n*   **B: Incorrect.** We don't have enough information to determine if they visited City F or not.\n*   **C: Possibly Correct.** We know they visited Lake G, but we need to check about Mountain H.\n*   **D: Incorrect.** We don't have enough information to determine if they visited City F.\n## Determining Visit to Mountain H:\n*   **Condition (3):** If they didn't visit City E, they couldn't visit Mountain H. \n*   **Two possibilities:**\n    *   **Visited City E:** They could have visited Mountain H, but it's not guaranteed.\n    *   **Didn't visit City E:** They definitely didn't visit Mountain H.\n## Conclusion:\nSince we cannot guarantee they visited Mountain H, the only option that **must be true** is that they visited Lake G.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
