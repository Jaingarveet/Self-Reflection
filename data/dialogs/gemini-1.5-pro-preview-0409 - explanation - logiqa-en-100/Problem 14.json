I focused too much on the adjacency restriction and not enough on the specific floor order implied by the clues.\n**Key Points:**\n1. **HR and Sales are not adjacent.** This means there's at least one floor between them.\n2. **Finance is above Planning.** This creates a fixed order: Planning, then Finance.\n3. **Administration is above Planning but below HR.** This further refines the order: Planning, then Finance, then Administration, then HR.\n4. **HR is not directly above Administration.** This means there's at least one floor between them.\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A: Sales above R&D:** This doesn't contradict the given information, as R&D's position is not specified. **Possible.**\n* **B: Sales above Administration:** This would place Sales between Administration and HR, violating the non-adjacency rule. **Not possible.**\n* **C: Sales above Planning:** This would place Sales between Planning and Finance, violating clue (2). **Not possible.**\n* **D: Sales on 2nd floor:** This would force Planning to be on the 1st floor, leaving no space for R&D. **Not possible.**\nTherefore, the only possible option is A.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
