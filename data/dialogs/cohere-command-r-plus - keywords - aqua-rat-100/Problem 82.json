The correct way to calculate the area of the field accessible to the cow is to treat it as a square with sides of length 7 feet (half the length of the rope).\n\nCorrect Solution:\nThe area accessible to the cow is a square with sides of length 7 feet, so the area of the field is 7 feet x 7 feet = 49 sq. ft.\nAt 10 sq. ft. per day, the number of days to graze the whole field is 49 / 10 = **4.9 days**, which is closest to **5 days**.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
