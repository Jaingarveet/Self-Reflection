What could be the least possible no of students in the school?\nChoices:\n  A: 550\n  B: 570\n  C: 600\n  D: 700\n  E: none of these\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Inequality error\n- Rounding error\n- Value estimation error\n\nSolution: Let the total number of students be $x$. The number of students who took physics is $20\\%$ of $x$, which is $0.2x$. The number of students who took math is $28\\%$ of $x$, which is $0.28x$. The number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of these, $0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x$. The number of students who took neither subject is the remaining percentage, $100\\% - 48\\% = 52\\%$, which is $0.52$ of $x$, or $0.52x$.\n\nWe are given that there are more than $501$ students in the school, so we can set up the following inequality: $0.52x > 501$. To solve for $x$, we divide by $0.52$, resulting in $x > 963.46$. Thus, the least possible number of students in the school is a value slightly greater than $963.46$. \n\nSince none of the answer choices represent a value slightly greater than $963.46$, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.\n"
