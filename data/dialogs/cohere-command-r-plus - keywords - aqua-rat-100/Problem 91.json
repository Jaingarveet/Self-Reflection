I incorrectly assumed that the final 2 km leg would bring A back to the origin, but this is not the case as it only brings him 2 km closer to the origin.\n\nCorrect solution: \nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the distance between the origin and A's final position. The vertical and horizontal distances from the origin are 3 km and 3 km, respectively. \n\n$\\sqrt{(3km)^2 + (3km)^2} = \\sqrt{18 km^2} = 3 \\sqrt{2} km$\n\nTherefore, A is approximately $3 \\sqrt{2}$ km or **5.5 km** away from home.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
