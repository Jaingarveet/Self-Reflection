        "content": "Thought: \nLet's assume that Jack bought $x$ white sharpeners and $y$ brown sharpeners. We know that:\n1. The total number of sharpeners is 18, so $x + y = 18$.\n2. The total cost of the sharpeners is ₹100, and Jack pays ₹1 more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener. So, the cost can be calculated as:\n$x$ white sharpeners at ₹$y + 1$ each $= ₹(y + 1)x$\n$y$ brown sharpeners at ₹$y$ each $= ₹yx$\nTotal cost $= ₹(y + 1)x + ₹yx = ₹100$\n\nNow, we can solve these equations:\nFrom equation 1, we know:\n$x + y = 18 \\implimplies y = 18 - x$\n\nSubstitute the expression for $y$ into equation 2:\n$₹(y + 1)x + ₹yx = ₹100$\n$₹(18 - x + 1)x + ₹(18 - x)x = ₹100$\n$₹19x - x^2 = ₹100$\n\nRearrange and solve for $x$:\n$x^2 + x - 100 = 0$\n$x = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 400}}{2}$\n$x = \\frac{-1 + 20}{2}$ or $x = \\frac{-1 - 20}{2}$\n$x = 9$ or $x = -11$\n\nSince we're dealing with a positive quantity, we take the positive value:\n$x = 9$\n\nNow that we know $x$, we can find $y$:\n$y = 18 - x = 18 - 9 = 9$\n\nSo, Jack bought 9 white sharpeners and 9 brown sharpeners.\n\nAnswer: B"
