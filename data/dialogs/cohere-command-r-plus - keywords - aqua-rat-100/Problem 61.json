Since he drives at 90 mph, it takes him 1 hour to drive from B to A, not 1.5 hours as previously calculated. This trip takes a total of 5 hours, so at the 4-hour mark, he is 70 miles away from B, which is the correct answer of 360 miles.\n\nThought: \nThe trip from A to B and back to A takes a total of 5 hours. \nAt the 4-hour mark, Kevin is 1 hour away from completing his trip, so he is on his way from B to A. \nSince he drives at 90 mph during this return trip, it takes him 1 hour to complete, meaning the distance from B to A is 90 miles. \nTherefore, the total distance between A and B is 90 miles * 2 = 180 miles.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
