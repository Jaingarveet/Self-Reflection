The correct answer is that no letter can be repeated to ensure unique codes.\n\nThought: \nWith 10 different types of books, Amy needs 10 unique codes. \nThe smallest single-letter code would be represented by one letter, so one letter is needed. \nFor a pair of letters, assuming the order does not matter, there are 9 choices for the first letter (any of the remaining letters) and 8 choices for the second letter (any of the remaining letters except the first). So, a total of 9*8 = 72 different pairs can be made. \n\nTherefore, the smallest number of letters needed for the codes is 1 for the single letter and 2 for the pairs, resulting in a minimum of 1 + 2 = 3 letters needed.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
