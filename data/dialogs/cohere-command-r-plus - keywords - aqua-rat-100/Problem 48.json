I incorrectly assumed that the percentage of students who were members of both the chess club and swim team was added to the percentage of students in the swim team only. I should have calculated the percentage of students who are members of the swim team only and then added this to the percentage of members in both clubs to get the final answer.\n\nThought: \nLet X be the percentage of students who are members of the swim team.\nThe percentage of members of both the chess club and swim team is 24%, so the percentage of students who are only in the swim team is (X - 24%) = 20%.\nSolving for X, we get X = 44%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
