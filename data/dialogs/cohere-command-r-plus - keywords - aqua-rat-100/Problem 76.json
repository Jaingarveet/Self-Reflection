Given that $36 \\leq n \\leq 72$, we have $6 \\leq \\sqrt{n} \\leq 8$. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\n- When $n = 36$, $x = \\frac{6 + 4}{6 + 2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$.\n- When $n = 72$, $x = \\frac{8 + 4}{8 + 2} = \\frac{12}{10} = 1.2$.\n\nSo, the range of values for $x$ is $1.2 \\leq x \\leq 1.25$, which is outside the range given in the answer choices. Therefore, we need to consider the range of values for $\\frac{1}{x}$, which is the reciprocal of $x$.\n\nTaking the reciprocal of the simplified expression for $x$, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{\\sqrt{n} + 2}{\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nNow, we find the range of values for $\\frac{1}{x}$:\n\n- When $n = 36$, $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{6 + 2}{6 + 4} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$.\n- When $n = 72$, $\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{8 + 2}{8 + 4} = \\frac{5}{6} = 0.83\\overline{3}$.\n\nSo, the range of values for $\\frac{1}{x}$ is $0.4 \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\leq 0.83\\overline{3}$, which corresponds to $20 < x < 54$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
