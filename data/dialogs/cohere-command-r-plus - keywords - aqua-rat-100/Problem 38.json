It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm .If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\nChoices:\n  A: 438\n  B: 550\n  C: 500\n  D: 450\n  E: 498\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n- Calculation error\n- Counting error\n- Underestimation\n\nSolution: The hollow cube consists of $5^3 = 125$ smaller cubes. Out of these, the smaller cubes on the outer surface, which are $3^3 = 27$ in total, will have some faces painted. Each of these outer smaller cubes has 5 unpainted faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is $27 \\times 5 = 135$.\n"
