I didn't consider the constraint that Susan had to be on the left of Tim, which reduced the possible arrangements.\n\nThought: There are three possible arrangements that follow the constraint: Susan-Tim-Zen, Susan-Zen-Tim, and Tim-Susan-Zen. However, because the question asks for arrangements on a straight line, and the chairs are identical, the arrangements Susan-Zen-Tim and Tim-Susan-Zen are considered the same, as they differ only by a reflection. So, the final answer is 2.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
