To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month over the entire 22-month period, I should have summed up the total number of ovens sold and then divided by 22. \n\nHere's the correct calculation:\nTotal number of ovens sold in the first year = 42 * 12 = 504\nTotal number of ovens sold in the first 10 months of the second year = 20 * 10 = 200\nTotal number of ovens sold in the entire 22-month period = 504 + 200 = 704\nAverage number of ovens sold per month = 704 / 22 = **32** ovens per month. \n\nSo, the correct answer is D: 32.\n\nThought: To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period, we need to consider the total number of ovens sold and then divide by 22.\n\nTotal number of ovens sold in the first year = 42 x 12 = 504\nTotal number of ovens sold in the first 10 months of this year = 20 x 10 = 200\nTotal number of ovens sold = 504 + 200 = 704\n\nNow, we divide by 22 to find the average:\n704 / 22 = **32**\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
