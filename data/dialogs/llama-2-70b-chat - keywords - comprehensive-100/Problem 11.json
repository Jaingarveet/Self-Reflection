After reevaluating the question and the given choices, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase.\n\nThis statement is the most doubtful of an assertion because it is a subjective opinion and lacks objective evidence. The chairman's belief is based on their personal perspective and experience, but it may not necessarily reflect the actual relationship between land development costs and housing prices. There could be other factors that influence housing prices, such as supply and demand, location, and economic conditions, which are not considered in this statement.\n\nIn contrast, the other choices provide more objective information that can be verified through data and analysis. Choice (A) provides specific data on housing and land prices in Shanghai, which can be used to support an argument about the relationship between land prices and housing prices. Choice (B) also provides data on housing and land prices in Beijing, which can be used to compare with Shanghai's data and draw conclusions about the housing market. Choice (D) is a statement about the relationship between supply and demand, which is a fundamental principle in economics and can be supported by data and analysis.\n\nTherefore, I correct my previous answer and select (C) The chairman of Huayuan Real Estate believes that as land development costs increase, house prices will definitely increase."
