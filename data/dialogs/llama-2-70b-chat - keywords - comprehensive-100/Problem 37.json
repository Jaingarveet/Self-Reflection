Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nError Keywords:\n"

The correct answer is E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nThe passage states that \"there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions\" and that \"not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\" These statements suggest that all cats have the potential to cause allergic reactions, and that the specific proteins responsible for triggering an allergic response can vary from cat to cat.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to predict whether a particular cat will produce an allergic reaction in a given allergy sufferer. This is because the specific proteins present in a cat's skin secretions and saliva can differ from one cat to another, and the specific allergies that a person has can also vary.\n\nSo, the correct answer is E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\n\nI hope this answer is correct. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns."
