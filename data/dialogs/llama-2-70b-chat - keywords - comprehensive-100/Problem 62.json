        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's analyze the system of equations:\n\n3x + 4y = -23 ... (1)\n2y - x = -19 ... (2)\n\nI will use substitution to solve the system. Solving (1) for x, we have:\n\nx = -4y - 23/3\n\nNow, substituting this expression for x into (2), we get:\n\n-4y^2 - 23y/3 - 19 = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n-4y^2 - 15y - 19 = 0\n\nNow, we can factor the left-hand side as:\n\n(2y + 3)(2y - 6) = 0\n\nTherefore, we have two possible solutions:\n\n2y + 3 = 0 or 2y - 6 = 0\n\nThe first equation gives us y = -3/2, and substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n\nx = -4(-3/2) - 23/3 = 3\n\nSo, the solution is (3, -3/2).\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
