I misunderstood the question and calculated the number of sales needed to reach a salary of $1000, not realizing that the question asked for the number of sales needed to reach a salary of at least $1000.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n* The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale.\n* The salesperson needs to make at least $1000 in commission.\n* Each sale is $250, so the commission for each sale is $25 (10% of $250).\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of sales needed:\n\n$1000 / $25 = 40 sales\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 40 sales.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
