Topical antibiotics are typically used for inflammatory acne, not comedonal acne.\n\nB: Benzoyl peroxide - This is a common treatment for comedonal acne. Benzoyl peroxide helps to unclog pores and reduce the bacterial count on the skin.\n\nC: Retinoids - This is also a good option for comedonal acne. Retinoids are derived from vitamin A and help to prevent clogged pores and reduce inflammation.\n\nD: Estrogen - This is not a suitable treatment for comedonal acne. Estrogen is a hormone that can help with hormonal acne, but it is not effective for comedonal acne.\n\nReflecting on my previous mistake, I realized that I misunderstood the mechanism of the drug and lacked knowledge about comedonal acne treatment.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - Benzoyl peroxide is the best treatment option for comedonal acne."
