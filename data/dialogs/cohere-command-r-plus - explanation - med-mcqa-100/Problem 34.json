Type I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate reactions mediated by IgE antibodies, which are produced by the body in response to specific allergens. In the case of spring catarrh, the allergens are typically pollen and other airborne substances that are more prevalent during the spring season.\n\nAnswer: Type I hypersensitivity reactions are acute reactions that occur immediately after exposure to an allergen, and they are mediated by IgE antibodies. The correct answer is indeed \"A: b\", indicating \"type I\"."
