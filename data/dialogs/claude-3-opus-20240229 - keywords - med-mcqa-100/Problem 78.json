It then courses over the mandible and onto the face.\nOn the face, the facial artery gives off several named branches including the inferior and superior labial arteries to the lips, and the lateral nasal artery.\nThe facial artery terminates near the medial canthus of the eye. In this location, it anastomoses with branches of the ophthalmic artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the orbit.\nTherefore, the facial artery terminates by anastomosing with a branch of the ophthalmic artery near the medial canthus.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
