It does not specifically target senescent cells.\nPlasmodium vivax and P. ovale have a strong preference for infecting reticulocytes (young red blood cells). They do not preferentially infect senescent cells.\nPlasmodium malariae (the cause of quartan malaria) has a preference for infecting older, mature red blood cells. Senescent red blood cells would fall into this category.\nTherefore, of the choices provided, quartan malaria caused by P. malariae is the best answer, as this species preferentially infects the oldest red blood cells, including senescent RBCs.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
