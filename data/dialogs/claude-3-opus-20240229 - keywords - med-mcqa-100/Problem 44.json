Cervical dilation \n2. Cervical effacement (length)\n3. Cervical consistency \n4. Cervical position\n5. Fetal station\nFor this patient:\n1. Cervical dilation is 3 cm. This scores 1 point.\n2. Cervical length is <0.5 cm, which means >80% effaced. This scores 2 points. \n3. Cervix is slightly soft. This scores 1 point.\n4. Cervix is located anteriorly. This scores 2 points.\n5. Fetal head is at -1 station. This scores 1 point.\nAdding up the points:\n1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 total points\nTherefore, her Bishop score is 7.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
