The clinical features that would occur from the deficiency are not provided.\nWithout knowing the specific signs and symptoms, it is not possible to definitively identify the amino acid deficiency in question. More information is needed about the clinical presentation to make an informed determination.\nGuessing between the amino acid answer choices without adequate clinical data would be inappropriate. A complete clinical picture is required to properly diagnose an amino acid deficiency syndrome.\nIn summary, this question cannot be answered as currently written due to the incomplete stem lacking necessary clinical details.
