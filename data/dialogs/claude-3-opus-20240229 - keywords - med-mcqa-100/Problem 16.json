        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\nThe second part of the axillary artery is located posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle. If this segment is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb will be maintained by collateral circulation from anastomoses between branches of the axillary artery proximal and distal to the obstruction.\nKey points:\n- We need to identify branches proximal and distal to the 2nd part\n- The branches should anatomically be able to form a collateral pathway\nAnalyzing the choices:\nA: The deep branch of transverse cervical artery is proximal, but the subscapular artery arises from the 3rd part of axillary artery, so both are distal to the obstruction. Incorrect.\nB: Both anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries arise from the 3rd part of axillary artery, distal to the obstruction. Incorrect.\nC: The posterior circumflex humeral artery is distal, but the circumflex scapular artery arises from the subscapular artery proximal to the 2nd part. This could provide collateral circulation. Potentially correct.\nD: The suprascapular artery arises from the 1st part of the axillary artery proximal to the obstruction, but the anterior circumflex humeral artery is a branch distal to the obstruction. This could also provide collateral circulation.\nBetween C and D, the suprascapular and circumflex scapular arteries arise more proximally and are better positioned anatomically to provide collateral circulation than the posterior circumflex humeral artery.\nTherefore, the best answer is D: Suprascapular & anterior circumflex humeral artery.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
