The question does not provide enough context for me to deduce the answer through reasoning alone.\nRather than guessing, I will acknowledge the limitations of my knowledge. The responsible approach is to refrain from selecting an answer when I lack the necessary information to do so reliably.\nIn a real-world situation, I would research authoritative sources on the history of India's mental health policies to find the correct start year of this particular programme. But given the constraints of this Q&A format, I do not have that option.\nTherefore, I must conclude that I do not know the answer based on the information provided. I cannot make a justified choice among the listed years without more historical context about the mental health programme in question."
