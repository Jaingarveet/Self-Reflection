        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. The patient has a primary tumor in the right upper lobe and a separate nodule in the middle lobe. This suggests the cancer is stage T4 due to the separate tumor nodule in the same lung but different lobe from the primary tumor.\n2. For stage T4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), surgery may still be an option if the tumors are resectable. The presence of the second nodule alone does not preclude surgery.\n3. If the tumors are resectable and the patient has adequate lung function and no distant metastases, surgical resection of the involved lobes (likely a bilobectomy in this case to remove the right upper and middle lobes) would be the preferred primary treatment. \n4. Chemotherapy and radiation are often used as adjuvant therapies after surgery for stage II-III NSCLC, but would not be the primary modality.\n5. Supportive care alone would only be considered if the patient had very poor functional status or advanced/unresectable disease.\nTherefore, assuming the tumors are resectable and the patient is an appropriate surgical candidate, the best primary treatment modality would be surgery.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
