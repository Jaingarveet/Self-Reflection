        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step, keeping in mind the key points from my previous reflection:\n1. Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in the absence of oxygen. This is important because it impacts the fate of the NADH produced.\n2. Glycolysis produces 2 ATP per glucose molecule. This part I had correct before. \n3. Glycolysis also produces 2 NADH per glucose. In aerobic conditions, these NADH would enter the electron transport chain to generate more ATP. However, in anaerobic conditions, there is no electron transport chain operating due to lack of oxygen.\n4. In anaerobic glycolysis, the NADH must be regenerated back to NAD+ in order for glycolysis to continue (since NAD+ is required as an electron acceptor). This is accomplished by converting pyruvate to lactate, oxidizing NADH to NAD+ in the process.\n5. Therefore, the end products of anaerobic glycolysis are:\n   - 2 ATP \n   - 2 NADH (which are then oxidized back to NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue)\n   - 2 Lactate (produced from pyruvate to regenerate NAD+)\nSo in summary, the key end products are 2 ATP and 2 NADH, with the NADH being recycled back to NAD+. This matches choice C.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
