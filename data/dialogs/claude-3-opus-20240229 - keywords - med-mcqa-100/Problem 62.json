The infundibulum - the funnel-shaped distal end near the ovary\n2. The ampulla - the widest and longest part, making up over half the tube's length \n3. The isthmus - the narrow part that connects the ampulla to the uterus\n4. The interstitial (or intramural) part - the short segment that passes through the uterine wall\nReflecting on my previous error, I had an anatomical misconception and confused the relative sizes of the uterine tube segments. The isthmus is actually the narrowest part, not the interstitial segment.\nThe correct answer is that the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the isthmus.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
