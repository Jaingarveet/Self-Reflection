It involves transplanting the insulin-producing islet cells from a donor pancreas.\n2. In my previous incorrect answer, I likely had an anatomical misunderstanding and incomplete knowledge of the transplantation technique. I need to be more precise about where the islet cells are actually transplanted.\n3. The skin and pelvis are not involved in this procedure, so choices A and D can be eliminated. \n4. Between the portal vein and liver, the portal vein is the correct site. The islet cells are injected into the portal vein, which carries them into the liver where they engraft and begin producing insulin.\n5. Injecting the cells directly into the liver parenchyma could damage the organ. The portal vein allows for safer, more diffuse cell delivery throughout the liver.\nTherefore, the site of transplantation in islet cell transplants for diabetes is the portal vein.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
