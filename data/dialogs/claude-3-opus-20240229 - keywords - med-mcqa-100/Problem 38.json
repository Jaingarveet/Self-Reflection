Of the remaining choices, only ureterocele is a congenital urinary tract anomaly. A bladder tumor would be an acquired condition.\nI previously confused ureterocele with another condition, likely vesicoureteral reflux based on the redacted text. However, the \"cobra head\" appearance specifically refers to the dilation of the distal ureter in ureterocele, not reflux.\nTherefore, the correct answer must be:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
