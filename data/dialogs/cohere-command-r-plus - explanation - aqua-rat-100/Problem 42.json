        "content": "Thought: \nEach picket takes up 1/2 inch of space and there are x pickets, so the total length of the pickets is x*(1/2) inches.\nBetween each pair of pickets, there are 6 inches of space, and there are (x-1) spaces between pickets. So, the total length of the spaces is 6*(x-1) inches.\nThe total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of the pickets and the spaces: x*(1/2) + 6*(x-1) = (1/2)*x + 6x - 6 inches.\nTo convert this length from inches to feet, we divide by 12 since there are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, the final answer is ((1/2)*x + 6x - 6)/12 feet, which can be simplified to (13x-12)/24 feet.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
