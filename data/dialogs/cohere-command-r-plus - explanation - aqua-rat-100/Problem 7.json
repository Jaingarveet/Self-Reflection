I should have started by finding the minimum number of letters required for the single-letter codes and the letter pairs separately and then adding those amounts together. \n\nFor single letters, Amy needs at least $3$ letters to create unique codes for the first $3$ types of books.\n\nFor letter pairs, she can create them from the same $3$ letters chosen for the single-letter codes. There are $3$ choices for the first letter and $2$ choices for the second letter (as it must be different from the first), giving $6$ unique pairs in total. With these $3$ letters, Amy can code for $3$ more types of books.\n\nSo, the smallest number of letters Amy needs is $5$ ($3$ single letters and $6$ letter pairs) to create codes for $6$ types of books. For the remaining $4$ types, she can use additional letters or reuse the existing ones to form new pairs.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
