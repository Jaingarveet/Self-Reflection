        "content": "Reflection: I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is 140°.\n\nHere's the correct reasoning:\nSince B bisects minor arc AC, the angle subtended by arc AC at the center of the circle is half of 160°, which is 80°. Similarly, the angle subtented by arc BD at the center is half of 150°, which is 75°.\n\nThe sum of angles in any quadrilateral is 360°, and this also applies to the quadrilateral formed by the lines connecting the center of the circle to points A, B, C, and D. \n\nTherefore, \n80° + 75° + angle subtended by arc AD + angle subtended by arc DA = 360°\n\nangle subtended by arc AD + 155° = 360° \n\nangle subtended by arc AD = 205° \n\nThe angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference, so the measure of minor arc AD is half of 205°, which is **140°**.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
