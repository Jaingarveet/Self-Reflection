The correct calculation is:\nLet X be the income.\nThe savings are 12.5% of X, which can be written as 0.125X.\nThe expenses are Rs. 3500.\nSo, we can set up the equation: X - 0.125X = Rs. 3500.\nCombining the like terms, we have 0.875X = Rs. 3500.\nTo find X, we divide both sides by 0.875: X = Rs. 4000.\n\nThought: \nThe man's savings are 12.5% of his income, and his expenses are Rs. 3500. \nTo find his monthly income, we subtract his savings from his total expenses: \n0.125X = 12.5/100 * X = 0.125 * X\nX - 0.125X = Rs. 3500\n0.875X = Rs. 3500\nX = Rs. 4000\n\nTherefore, his monthly income is Rs. 4000.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
