However, upon closer inspection, I realized that the first charge is separate, and this changes the calculation significantly.\n\nCorrect solution:\n- For the first quarter-mile, the charge is a flat rate of $3.50.\n- For each additional quarter-mile, the charge is $0.10.\n\nTo find the maximum distance, we need to calculate how many miles can be traveled for $8.50. \n\nStarting from the second quarter-mile, we can calculate the number of miles by dividing the remaining money by the charge per mile. \n\n$8.00 (remaining money after the flat rate) divided by $0.10 (charge per quarter-mile) equals 80 quarter-miles, which is equivalent to 20 miles. \n\nNow, we add back the first quarter-mile to get a total distance of 20 + 1 = **21 miles**. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")"
