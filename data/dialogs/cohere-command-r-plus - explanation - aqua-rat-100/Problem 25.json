Then, the distance from the car to the top of the tower is $d\\tan45^\\circ=d$.\n\nAfter $10$ minutes, the angle of elevation becomes $60^\\circ$, so the distance from the car to the top of the tower becomes $d\\tan60^\\circ=\\sqrt3d$. Therefore, the car has moved a distance of $(\\sqrt3-1)d$ in $10$ minutes.\n\nLet $s$ be the speed of the car. Then, $s=d/10$ meters per minute.\n\nThe car will reach the base of the tower when it has moved a total distance of $d$ from the time the angle of elevation was $45^\\circ$. Setting up an equation, we have:\n\\[d = (\\sqrt3 - 1)d/s + d,\\]\nwhich simplifies to $\\sqrt3 - 2 = 10/s$. Multiplying by $s$, we get $s = 10/(\\sqrt3 - 2)$.\n\nFinally, we can find the time $t$ it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower:\n\\[t = d/s = \\frac{10/(\\sqrt3 - 2)}{10} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt3 - 2} = \\boxed{5(\\sqrt3 + 1)}\\]\n\nSo, the answer is $A$.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
