        "content": "Reflection: The correct answer is B: 7.\n\nMy previous thought process was as follows: Since U is the midpoint of ST, the length of UT is equal to the length of US, and these lengths are half of ST. So, UT = US = 11.\n\nNow, to find the length of RU, I subtracted the length of RT from the length of ST: RU = ST - RT = 22 - 17 = 5.\n\nHowever, I made a mistake in calculating the length of UT and US. Instead of half of ST, they should be half of the remaining length of ST after subtracting RS, which is 22 - 5 = 17. So, UT = US = 17 / 2 = **8.5**.\n\nTherefore, the length of RU is **17 - 8.5 = 8.5**, which is not one of the provided options. The correct answer should be the length of RT, which is 17 - 5 = **12**, but that option is also unavailable.\n\nUpon further investigation, I noticed that my calculation for the length of UT and US was incorrect. UT and US should be equal to each other but not exactly half of the length of ST. They should be half of the remaining length of ST after subtracting RS, which is 22 - 5 = 17. So, UT = US = 17 / 2 = 8.5.\n\nNow, the length of RU can be calculated as RU = RT - UT = 17 - 8.5 = **8.5** which is still not one of the provided options.\n\nFinally, I realized that my initial calculation of ST - RT for RU was correct. Correct answer: **B: 7** (RT = 17 - 5 = 12, and since U is the midpoint, RU = 12 / 2 = 6, so RU = 6 units)."
