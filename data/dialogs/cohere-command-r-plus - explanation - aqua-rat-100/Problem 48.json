We know that 24% are in both chess club and swim team, so if X is the total number of students, 0.24X students are in both groups.\n2. We also know that 20% of the swim team is not in the chess club, so 0.2*(Total swim team) = 0.2*(0.24X + Y) = 0.048X + 0.2Y, where Y is the number of students in the swim team only.\n3. From the second piece of information, we can deduce that 0.24X + Y = 1.2*(0.048X + 0.2Y), which simplifies to Y = 0.72X.\n4. Thus, the total number of students in the swim team is 0.72X + 0.24X = 0.96X.\n5. So, the percentage of students in the swim team is (0.96X / X) * 100 = 96%, which is choice E."
