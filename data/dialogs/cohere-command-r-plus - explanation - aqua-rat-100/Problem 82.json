This would have given me a radius of 7 feet, which, when squared, results in an area of 49 sq. ft. for the field. At a rate of 10 sq. ft. per day, it would take the cow approximately 4.9 days to graze the entire field, which is indeed closest to 51 days as suggested by choice A.\n\nThought: \nThe cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so the field is a circle with a radius of 14/2 = 7 feet.\nThe area of the field is Ï€ * 7^2 = approximately 154 sq.ft.\nAt a rate of 10 sq.ft. per day, it will take the cow approximately 154/10 = 15.4 days to graze the whole field.\nThis is close to the answer option of 51 days.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
