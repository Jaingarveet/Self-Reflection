If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?\nChoices:\n  A: 56\n  B: 58\n  C: 60\n  D: 62\n  E: 64\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made a mistake in calculating the side length of the original square. I correctly found the area of the square but then took the square root of that area to find the side length, which is incorrect. This led me to choose the incorrect answer, as I didn't catch this error.\n"
