At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share.

        "content": "Thought: \nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n1. We know that A and B were partners for some months before C joined. During this time, their profit should be proportional to their investment. \n2. Let's calculate their profit for the time they were partners:\n   - Total investment for this period = Rs. 40,000 (A's investment) + Rs. 60,000 (B's investment) = Rs. 100,000\n   - Total profit for the year = Rs. 375,000\n   - Proportion of profit for this period = (100,000 / total investment) * total profit = (100,000 / sum of investments) * Rs. 375,000\n   - Their profit for this period = (100,000 / sum of investments) * Rs. 375,000 = (1/3) * Rs. 375,000 = Rs. 125,000\n3. Now, we can find out for how many months A and B were partners:\n   - Their investment for this period = Rs. 100,000\n   - Monthly profit at this rate = Rs. 125,000 / 10 months = Rs. 12,500\n   - So, A and B were partners for 2 months (since their monthly profit for this period is Rs. 12,500, and we're told they made no profit before B joined)\n4. Now, we can calculate for how long B and C were partners:\n   - We know C joined for the remaining 10 months of the year (12 months total - 2 months when only A and B were partners)\n   - During this time, B and C's profit = Total profit - A and B's profit during their partnership = Rs. 375,000 - Rs. 125,000 = Rs. 250,000\n5. Finally, we can calculate the ratio of B and C's investments to determine C's share:\n   - Ratio of B's investment to C's investment = 60,000:120,000 = 1:2\n   - So, C's share = (2/3) * B and C's profit = (2/3) * Rs. 250,000 = Rs. 166,667\n\nTherefore, C joined 2 months after B, as the question asks for the number of months and not the total time period. \n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
