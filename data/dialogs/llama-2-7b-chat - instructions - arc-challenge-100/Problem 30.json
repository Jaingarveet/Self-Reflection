        "content": "  Reflection:\n\nIn my previous answer, I incorrectly stated that frost forms when water vapor in the air condenses. However, upon further reflection, I understand that frost actually forms when moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter.\n\nThe process that occurs is called sublimation, where water vapor in the air directly changes from a liquid to a gas without first melting into a liquid. This happens because the cold surface causes the water vapor to lose heat, which allows it to change state from a liquid to a gas. As a result, frost forms on the surface.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) It has sublimated.\n\nAnswer: (B) It has sublimated."
