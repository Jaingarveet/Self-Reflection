They are known for their ability to drop their tails when threatened or attacked by predators. This behavior is an example of an escape strategy called \"autotomy,\" which is the ability to shed a body part to escape danger.\n\nEscape Strategy: When a newt is threatened or attacked by a predator, it can drop its tail to distract the predator and allow the newt to escape. The dropped tail continues to wriggle and move, which can confuse the predator and give the newt time to escape. This escape strategy is called \"autotomy\" because the newt is able to shed its tail without damaging its internal organs or vital systems.\n\nAnswer: B: Newts drop their tails when threatened.\n\nExplanation: Newts use the escape strategy of autotomy, or dropping their tails, to avoid being killed and eaten by predators. When threatened, the newt can drop its tail to distract the predator and allow the newt to escape. This behavior is an example of an escape strategy that is used to avoid being killed and eaten by predators."
