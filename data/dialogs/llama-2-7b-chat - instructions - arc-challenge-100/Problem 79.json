Identify the process of digestion: Digestion is the process by which the body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the body for energy, growth, and repair.\n2. Determine which of the options provided indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion: The correct answer is B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides.\n\nDuring digestion, pepsin is secreted by the stomach to break down proteins into smaller peptides. This is a physical change because it involves a chemical reaction that changes the structure of the food molecules.\n\n3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided: The correct answer is B: the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides.\n\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy: Yes, I have double-checked my answer, and it is correct.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
