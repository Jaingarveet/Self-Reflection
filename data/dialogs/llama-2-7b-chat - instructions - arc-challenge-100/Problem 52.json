The characteristic being described is the presence of a single loop of DNA for storing hereditary material.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, I will identify the taxonomic group of organisms that possess this characteristic. The correct answer is (D) Animals.\n\nAnimals are the only taxonomic group that store their hereditary material in a single loop of DNA, known as a chromosome. Other organisms, such as bacteria and fungi, have multiple loops of DNA for their hereditary material. Plants and fungi have a different type of hereditary material called chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) Animals."
