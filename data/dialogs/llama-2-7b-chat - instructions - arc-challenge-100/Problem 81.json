These rays can cause eye damage and skin burns, making it crucial to take the necessary precautions.\n\nOption A, \"Use only new equipment,\" is not a sufficient precaution as new equipment may not have the necessary filters or projection methods to block out the harmful rays.\n\nOption B, \"Use a very strong telescope,\" is also not the correct answer as a stronger telescope does not necessarily provide adequate protection from the Sun's rays.\n\nOption D, \"Look at the Sun only in the morning,\" is also not the correct answer as the Sun's rays can be harmful at any time of the day.\n\nConclusion:\nTo safely observe the Sun, it is crucial to use a specialized filter or projection method to block out the harmful rays. Option C, \"Project the image of the Sun onto a piece of cardboard using a telescope or binoculars,\" is the correct answer."
