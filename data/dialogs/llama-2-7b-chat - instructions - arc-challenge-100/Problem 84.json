How does the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly affect freshwater ecosystems?\nChoices:\n  A: increasing biodiversity\n  B: increasing water clarity\n  C: decreasing algae blooms\n  D: decreasing oxygen levels\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the type of ecosystem being affected (freshwater).\n2. Recognize the potential impact of fertilizers on this ecosystem (increased algae growth).\n3. Understand the consequences of increased algae growth (decreased water clarity, decreased oxygen levels, increased risk of harmful algal blooms).\n4. Choose the answer that best describes the impact of fertilizers on freshwater ecosystems.\n"
