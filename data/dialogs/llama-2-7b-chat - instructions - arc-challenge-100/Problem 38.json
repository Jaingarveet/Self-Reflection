To determine which of the following has the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each volume of bricks and air.\n\nReflection:\nI reflected on my previous answer and realized that I made a mistake in calculating the mass of the bricks. I calculated the mass of 2 m^3 of bricks as 4000 kg (2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3), but this is incorrect. The correct mass of 2 m^3 of bricks is 2000 kg (2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3).\n\nI also realized that I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking for the mass of a single m^3 of bricks, rather than the mass of multiple m^3 of bricks.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
