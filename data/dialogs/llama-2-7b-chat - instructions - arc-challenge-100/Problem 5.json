How many grams is the sugar-and-water solution?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer.\n\n1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water.\n\nTo find the amount of sugar in the solution, we can use the formula:\n\nAmount of sugar = Amount of sugar dissolved in water x Concentration of sugar in solution\n\nWe know that 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water, so the concentration of sugar in the solution is:\n\nConcentration of sugar in solution = Amount of sugar dissolved in water / Amount of water = 10 g / 100 g = 0.1 g/g\n\nNow, we can use the formula to find the amount of sugar in the solution:\n\nAmount of sugar in the solution = Amount of sugar dissolved in water x Concentration of sugar in solution\n= 10 g x 0.1 g/g\n= 1 g\n\nTherefore, the sugar-and-water solution contains 1 gram of sugar.\n\n3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA: 90 g\nB: 100 g\nC: 110 g\nD: 1000 g\n\nSince the correct answer is 1 g, we can eliminate options A, C, and D, which are greater than 1 g.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: 100 g."
