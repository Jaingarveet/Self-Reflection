Recognize that potential energy is energy that has the potential to do work, while kinetic energy is energy of motion.\n2. Identify the correct type of energy for each option:\n\t* Sound energy is a type of kinetic energy (it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance).\n\t* Radiant energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work).\n\t* Chemical energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work through chemical reactions).\n3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n4. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.\n"
