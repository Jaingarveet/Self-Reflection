There are 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews, totaling 11 family members. \n\nEach nephew receives x amount. So, the daughters get 4x, and the sons get 5x. \n\nWe can set up the equation: \n5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600 \n\nCombining like terms: \n25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 \n43x = 8600 \nx = 200\n\nTherefore, each nephew receives Rs 200. And since each daughter receives four times that amount, the final answer is Rs 800. \n\nCorrect answer: E"
