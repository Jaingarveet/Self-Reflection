Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.\nQuestion: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above?\nChoices:\n  A: During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints.\n  B: The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter.\n  C: It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars.\n  D: Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring.\n  E: Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always identify the conclusion and premises of the argument.\n - Always identify the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument.\n - Always look for answer choices that present a similar pattern of flawed reasoning.\n - Always choose the answer choice that presents the most similar pattern of flawed reasoning.\n"
