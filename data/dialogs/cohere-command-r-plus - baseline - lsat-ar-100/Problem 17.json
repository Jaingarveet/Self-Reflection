The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?\nChoices:\n  A: day 1 and day 3\n  B: day 2 and day 6\n  C: day 3 and day 5\n  D: day 4 and day 6\n  E: day 5 and day 7\n"
