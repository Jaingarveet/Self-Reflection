The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are both selected.\n  B: G and H are both selected.\n  C: H and P are both selected.\n  D: F, G, and H are all selected.\n  E: P, Q, and R are all selected.\n"
