Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?\nChoices:\n  A: two\n  B: three\n  C: four\n  D: five\n  E: six\n"

This means that either bay 3 or bay 5 holds textiles, but we cannot determine which one without additional information.\nWe also know that the bay holding produce is higher than the bay holding fuel, so fuel must be in either bay 1, 2, or 3. Again, we don't have enough information to pinpoint which bay holds fuel.\nSimilarly, machinery and livestock could be in any of the remaining bays, and we cannot determine their exact locations with the given clues.\n\nSo, for exactly two bays (4 and 6), the type of cargo they are holding is completely determined.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
