This immediately eliminates options B and C, as they do not meet the minimum number of novels.\n\nOption A does not work because it violates the requirement to select at least as many French novels as Russian novels.\n\nOption D is also invalid because it includes too many French works - three French novels and two French plays would be five in total, which exceeds the limit of four.\n\nThat leaves us with option E, which meets all the requirements: three French novels and two Russian novels meet the minimum of three novels and the maximum of four French works, and the additional Russian play is permissible as only one French play was selected.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
