The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.\nQuestion: If G is fourth, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: H is fifth.\n  B: J is first.\n  C: Q is second.\n  D: S is fifth\n  E: Y is sixth.\n"
