Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?\nChoices:\n  A: George and Lenore\n  B: Helen and Nina\n  C: Irving and Robert\n  D: Kyle and Nina\n  E: Olivia and Kyle\n"

This means that Nina, Helen, and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday, as someone must give the morning report that day.\n\nTherefore, if Nina and another student give reports on the same day, it must be Monday, which leaves Wednesday free for the remaining two students.\n\nOf the answer choices, Nina is only paired with another student in options D and E. We can now eliminate option E as it includes Kyle, who could give a report on any day and does not have to be paired with Nina.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D: Kyle and Nina.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
