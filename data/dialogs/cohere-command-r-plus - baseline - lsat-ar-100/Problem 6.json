The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews more of the plays than Lopez does.\n  B: Megregian reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  C: Megregian reviews more of the plays than O'Neill does.\n  D: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Jiang does.\n  E: O'Neill reviews more of the plays than Kramer does.\n"

This means that Megregian must be reviewing three plays, Lopez is reviewing one play, and Kramer reviews either one or two plays.\n\nSince exactly two students review the same play(s), and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, it must be the case that Lopez and Megregian review unique plays, and Jiang reviews the same play(s) as either Kramer or O'Neill.\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that O'Neill and Jiang review more plays than Lopez, eliminating options C, D, and E.\n\nBetween options A and B, we cannot definitively state that Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez, as Jiang could review the same play(s) as O'Neill, in which case they would both review two plays. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
