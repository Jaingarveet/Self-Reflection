Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant\n  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant\n  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant\n  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy\n  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy\n"

This rules out choices C, D, and E, as these options have other businesses at both ends of the row and do not satisfy the proximity requirement for the pharmacy. \n\nChoice B can also be eliminated because it places the two restaurants adjacent to each other with only one business between them, which does not meet the minimum separation requirement. \n\nChoice A is the only option that meets all the constraints. The pharmacy and the optometrist are at one end, with the restaurant at the other, and there are two businesses (the shoe store and the veterinarian) between the two restaurants. Additionally, the toy store is not placed next to the veterinarian.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
