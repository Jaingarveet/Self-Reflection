Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\n  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.\n  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.\n  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\n"
