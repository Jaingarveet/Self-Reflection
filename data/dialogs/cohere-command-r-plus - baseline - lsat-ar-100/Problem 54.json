The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang reviews Sunset.\n  B: Lopez reviews Undulation.\n  C: Megregian reviews Sunset.\n  D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.\n  E: O'Neill reviews Undulation.\n"

This means that the two students who review the same plays must be Lopez and O'Neill, as they are the only pair that Megregian doesn't overlap with.\n\nAs Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, the plays reviewed by Lopez and O'Neill are Sunset and Undulation, although we don't know who reviewed which play.\n\nAs Jiang doesn't review any of the same plays as Megregian, the plays available for Jiang to review are Sunset and Undulation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
