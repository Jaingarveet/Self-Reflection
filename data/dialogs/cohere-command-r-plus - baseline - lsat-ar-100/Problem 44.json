The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Greyhounds are featured on days 3 and 5.\n  B: Newfoundlands are featured on day 3.\n  C: Rottweilers are featured on day 6.\n  D: Rottweilers are featured only on day 3.\n  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.\n"

This rules out choices A and B, as Greyhounds and Newfoundlands, respectively, would be featured on consecutive days (days 1 and 3) if these choices were true.\n\nChoice C can also be ruled out because we know that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 and that any breed featured on day 1 (Greyhounds) is not featured on day 7.\n\nChoice D is possible as it does not violate any of the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: Rottweilers could be featured only on day 3.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
