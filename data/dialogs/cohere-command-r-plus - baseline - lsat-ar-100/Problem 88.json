At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n"
