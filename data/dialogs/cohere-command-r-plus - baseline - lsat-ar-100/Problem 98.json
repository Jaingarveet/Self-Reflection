If M is shown in the morning or afternoon, then N and O could be shown after M, but L would still need to be shown before them.\n\nChoice E is incorrect because there is no definite relationship between K and P; P could be shown at any time, depending on the placement of N and O.\n\nThus, choice A is the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
