This cannot be true as Franco testifies on Monday and Iturbe on Wednesday.\n- Choice C: Garcia and Hong are both scheduled to testify on Tuesday.

This goes against the condition that Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day, and that Hong does not testify on Monday.\n- Choice E: Jackson testifies on Tuesday, and two witnesses testify on Monday.
