        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.\nQuestion: If Image's website target is 2 days, which one of the following targets must also be 2 days?\nChoices:\n  A: Image's voicemail target\n  B: Solide's website target\n  C: Solide's voicemail target\n  D: Truvest's website target\n  E: Truvest's voicemail target\n"

So, Solide's website target must be 1 day.\n- Truvest's website target can now be determined to be 3 days, as it must be longer than Solide's, and the options are 1, 2, or 3 days.\n- Truvest's voicemail target is not necessarily 2 days, as it can be 1 or 3 days and still meet the condition that it is longer than Image's voicemail target (1 day).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Solide's website target.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
