The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?\nChoices:\n  A: F, G, K, P, Q\n  B: G, H, K, L, M\n  C: G, H, K, L, R\n  D: H, K, M, P, R\n  E: H, L, M, P, Q\n"

It violates the condition that states, \"If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.\"\n\nB: G, H, K, L, M - This selection includes two botanists (G and H) and two chemists (K and M). It violates the condition that \"at least one scientist of each of the three types\" must be on the panel, as there is no zoologist.\n\nC: G, H, K, L, R - This selection includes two botanists (G and H) and only one chemist (K). It violates the condition that \"F and K cannot both be selected.\"\n\nD: H, K, M, P, R - This selection satisfies all the given conditions. It includes one botanist (H), two chemists (K and M), and two zoologists (P and R). It is acceptable because the conditions state that if more than one chemist is selected (in this case, K and M), then it is allowed to have two zoologists (P and R) as well.\n\nE: H, L, M, P, Q - This selection includes only one botanist (H) and two chemists (L and M). However, it violates the condition that \"If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: H, K, M, P, R.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
