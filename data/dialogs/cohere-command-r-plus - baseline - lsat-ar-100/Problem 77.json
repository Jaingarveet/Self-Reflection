Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\n"

This means that only two of those four spaces will be available for the other five employees.\n\nYoung must have a higher number than Togowa, so if Togowa is assigned #1, then Young could only be assigned #2, #3, or #4 (three options). If Togowa is assigned #2, then Young could only have #3 or #4 (two options). So, Young has a maximum of three options but can have as few as two, depending on the other assignments.\n\nXu must have a higher number than Souza, so they also have a maximum of three options but can have as few as two, similar to Young and Togowa.\n\nTherefore, there are three employees (Robertson, Xu, and Souza) who at most can only be assigned to two possible spaces.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
