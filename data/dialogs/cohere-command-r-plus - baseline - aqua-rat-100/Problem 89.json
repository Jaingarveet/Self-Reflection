Therefore, traveling further will be more efficient in terms of cost.\n\nLet's calculate the cost for distances varying by one mile, starting from 1 mile and ending at 10 miles, with a step of 1 mile.\n1 mile: $0.40\n2 miles: $0.50\n...\n9 miles: $2.90\n10 miles: $3.40\n\nSince we have a budget of $8.50 for the ride, the maximum distance we can travel is 10 miles for $3.40, leaving us with a balance of $5.10 for the fare. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 10 miles, or choice E: 10.75 miles.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
