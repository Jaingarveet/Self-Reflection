It is a mighty people that $\\mathrm{He}$ has planted on this soil; a people sprung from the most masterful blood of history; a people perpetually revitalized by the virile ... working-folk10 of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes-the propagandists and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a15 history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future; a history of statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands ... a history of soldiers, who carried the flag20 across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a history of a multiplying people, who overran a continent in half a century ... a history divinely logical, in the process of whose tremendous 25 reasoning we find ourselves to-day....Think of the thousands of Americans who will pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the Republic's laws cover those islands with justice and safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans30 who will invade ... the Philippines when a liberal government ... shall establish order and equity there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who will build a . . civilization of energy and industry in Cuba, when a government of law35 replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!think of the prosperous millions that Empress of Islands will support when, obedient to the law of political gravitation, her people ask for the highest honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the40 Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great Republic!\\section{Passage 2}If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the45 Republican party ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability.The Filipinos do not need any encouragement 50 from Americans now living. Our whole history has been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their own government. If the Republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated tomake the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" he exprest a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men.60 Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of history none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.$65 \\mathrm{Or}$, if the statute of limitations has run against the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular government when the present advocates of force and conquest are 70 forgotten.Some one has said that a truth once spoken can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or 75 spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every human heart the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so80 low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master.Those who would have this Nation enter upon a career of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also85 calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here\nQuestion: Which choice best describes a central difference between how Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) view the concept of liberty as it is realized in the United States?\nChoices:\n  A: Beveridge presents it as the direct inheritance of European colonization, whereas Bryan presents it as a sharp break from earlier governments in Europe.\n  B: Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.\n  C: Beveridge argues that it arose organically as the United States matured, whereas Bryan argues that it was present from the country's beginnings.\n  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n\n1. Always read the passages carefully and understand the authors' perspectives on the topic.\n2.

Beveridge views liberty as a concept that the United States inherited from European colonization and believes it should be shared with other countries. On the other hand, Bryan sees liberty as a unique concept that arose organically in the United States and warns against imperial expansion, as it would undermine its exemplary quality.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, I need to carefully read the passages, identify the central difference between the two perspectives, and choose the appropriate answer option. I should also practice active reading and critical thinking to improve my comprehension of complex texts.\n\nAfter re-reading the passages, I realized that the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty is that Beveridge considers it exemplary and justifies conquest, whereas Bryan warns against imperial expansion, as it would undermine its quality. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nI will make sure to carefully read and analyze the passages in the future and practice active reading and critical thinking to improve my performance."
