However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.\n  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.\n  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.\n  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.\n  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n - Carefully analyze the argument and identify its underlying assumptions and implications. \n - Consider the role of each element in the argument and how they relate to one another. \n - Look for answer choices that directly engage with these assumptions and their potential consequences. \n - Avoid choices that introduce irrelevant or tangential concepts, even if they are related to the broader topic. \n - Remember that the correct answer should reflect the logical foundation of the professor's conclusion, not necessarily its broader implications or potential benefits.\n"

However, upon further reflection, this choice doesn't directly address the role of intellectual discipline or its connection to the conclusion. Choice 'B' can be eliminated as it focuses on societal values rather than the individual thinker. Choice 'C' contradicts the premise about freedom of thought fostering progress and doesn't explain the conclusion. Choice 'D' discusses creativity, which isn't the primary focus of the argument. \n\nThe correct answer is 'E'. By choosing this, we can see that the professor assumes that intellectual discipline is a prerequisite for freedom of thought, and without it, the freedom to explore ideas fully would be compromised, thus hindering intellectual progress.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
