Although new recycling projects could greatly reduce this amount, these projects would actually be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims about new recycling projects?\nChoices:\n  A: The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials.\n  B: The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.\n  C: The mayor's city has nearly exhausted its landfill space and therefore must incinerate much of its garbage.\n  D: More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes.\n  E: People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need than do people who do not recycle.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Ensure you fully understand the context and any apparent inconsistencies before formulating an answer. \n- Pay close attention to the specific details and nuances presented in the problem. \n- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that aren't directly supported by the provided information. \n- Consider how each answer choice fits within the broader context and its potential implications. \n- Remember that resolving inconsistencies often involves identifying missing or implied information.\n"
