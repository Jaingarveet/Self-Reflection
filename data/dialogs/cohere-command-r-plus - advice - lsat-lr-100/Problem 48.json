Assumption \"C\" is the key link in this chain of reasoning. It connects the planned spending reduction and the need to increase enrollment to the proposed solution of aggressive marketing. \n\nChoice \"A\" is incorrect as it contradicts the argument's conclusion that maintaining educational quality depends on increased enrollment. Choice \"B\" is irrelevant as the argument focuses on the relationship between enrollment, marketing, and spending, not on the absence of spending reductions. Choice \"D\" is a plausible consequence but is not essential to the argument's conclusion. Choice \"E\" is tempting as it relates spending reductions to marketing, but it does not address the role of marketing in increasing enrollment, which is central to the argument.\n\nThus, choice \"C\" is the correct answer as it completes the argument's logical chain.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
