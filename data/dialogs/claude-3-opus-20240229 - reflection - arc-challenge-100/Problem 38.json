I calculated the masses correctly but failed to properly compare the magnitudes and identify the smallest value. My knowledge gap was not in the physics concepts or calculations, but rather in the final comparative analysis step.\nError Keywords:\n - Comparative reasoning error\n - Magnitude comparison error\n - Incorrect answer selection\nSolution:\nGiven:\n- Red-clay bricks have a density of 2000 kg/m^3\n- Air has a density of 1 kg/m^3\nTo find the mass, use the formula: mass = density × volume\nA: 2 m^3 of bricks\nmass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 2 m^3 = 4000 kg\nB: 4 m^3 of bricks \nmass = 2000 kg/m^3 × 4 m^3 = 8000 kg\nC: 6000 m^3 of air\nmass = 1 kg/m^3 × 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg \nD: 10,000 m^3 of air\nmass = 1 kg/m^3 × 10,000 m^3 = 10,000 kg\nComparing the calculated masses:\n4000 kg < 6000 kg < 8000 kg < 10,000 kg\nTherefore, the lowest mass is 4000 kg, which corresponds to choice A: 2 m^3 of bricks.\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the density values given for each material.\n2. Identify the volume values given for each choice.\n3. Use the formula mass = density × volume to calculate mass for each choice.\n4. Compare the calculated mass values to determine which is the smallest.\n5.
