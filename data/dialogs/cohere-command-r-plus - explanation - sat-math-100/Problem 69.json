The equation should represent the relationship between the number of miles driven and the cost savings, not the number of gallons.\n\n$\\frac{25}{4}$ represents the number of miles driven per dollar spent, so to find the number of miles driven for a $5 saving, we multiply:\n$\\frac{25}{4} \\times 5 = 125/4 = 31.25$ miles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: $\\frac{25}{4}m = 5$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
