So, the point $(-2,1)$ lies on the line.\nUsing the point-gradient formula $\\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}=m$, we can find the gradient:\n\\[m=\\frac{-2-(-3)}{1-1}=\\frac{1}{0} \\, .\\]\nThis is undefined, so we cannot find the gradient using this method.\n\nHowever, we can see that the difference between the $y$-values is 3, and the difference between the $x$-values is 1.\nThis means the gradient is $\\frac{3}{1}=3$.\n\nNow we can use one of the points to find the y-intercept.\nUsing the formula $y=mx+c$, we get:\n\\[-2=3\\times1+c \\, .\\]\nSolving for $c$, we find the y-intercept is $c=-5$.\n\nTherefore, the function is $f(n)=3n-5$.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
