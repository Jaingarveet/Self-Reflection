However, upon reflection, I realized that the range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, and even without the outlier, the maximum value would only decrease by a small amount, resulting in a minimal change in the range.\n\nThought: Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median at all, as it falls in the middle of the list of numbers. The range will still be quite large even without the outlier, so it will not change much. However, the mean will be significantly affected since it takes into account all the values and the outlier is much larger than the rest of the data.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
