Starting at the origin, moving $7$ units to the right (along the x-axis), and then rising by $1$ unit (along the y-axis) we arrive at the point $(7,1)$. This point satisfies the slope's condition of rising by $1$ after moving $7$ units to the right. Therefore, the correct answer is $(7,1)$. None of the provided options have a second coordinate of $1$, so the answer must be \"None of the Above.\""
