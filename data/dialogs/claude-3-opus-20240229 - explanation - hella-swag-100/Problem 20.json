While birds walking on the beach are common, the phrasing \"a bird appears to divebomb into the ocean\" suggests a surprising and notable visual that would fit well in an action-oriented surfing video. I was thinking too literally and not imaginatively enough about what would make for compelling video content.\n"

It adds an element of excitement and unexpectedness that aligns well with the surfing theme.\nThe phrasing \"appears to divebomb\" also suggests a striking visual that would grab the viewer's attention, making it a strong choice for this kind of video.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
