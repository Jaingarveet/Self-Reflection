Determine which property is common to both samples.\n4. Choose the correct answer based on your analysis.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the terms used.\n* Make sure you understand the properties of matter and their differences in different states.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the properties of the samples in question.\n* Remember that a sample can refer to a small portion of a substance, not necessarily the number of atoms it contains.\n"
