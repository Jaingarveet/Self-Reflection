I thought that the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices was a physical change, but it is actually a chemical change.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of physical change\n* Misconception of digestion process\n\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is D, the squeezing of food through the intestines, which is a physical change that occurs during digestion.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the concept of physical change in the context of digestion.\n2. Identify the correct answer by understanding that physical change refers to a change in the physical state of a substance, such as the squeezing of food through the intestines.\n3. Double-check your answer by ensuring that it aligns with the concept of physical change.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the concept being asked.\n* Don't assume that you know the answer without carefully considering the question.\n* Double-check your answer to ensure that it aligns with the concept being asked.\n* Review the relevant concepts and processes to ensure that you have a solid understanding.\n* Practice active reading and critical thinking when answering questions.\n"
