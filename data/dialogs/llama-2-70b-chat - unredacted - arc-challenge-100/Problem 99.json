I thought that weathering was the process that led to the construction of new land, but it is actually deposition that plays this role. Deposition is the process of sediment settling in a new location, which can lead to the formation of new land.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding\n* Confusion\n* Sediment transport\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Review the definitions of weathering, erosion, deposition, and sediment transport.\n2. Understand that weathering is the breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces, while deposition is the process of sediment settling in a new location.\n3. Recognize that deposition, not weathering, is the process that leads to the construction of new land.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the key concepts.\n2. Review the definitions of the processes mentioned in the question.\n3. Understand the relationships between the processes and how they interact.\n4. Choose the answer that best matches the process described in the question.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always review the definitions of key concepts before answering a question.\n* Understand the relationships between different processes and how they interact.\n* Pay close attention to the specific details mentioned in the question.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the question and the available choices.\n* Remember that deposition, not weathering, is the process that leads to the construction of new land.\n"
