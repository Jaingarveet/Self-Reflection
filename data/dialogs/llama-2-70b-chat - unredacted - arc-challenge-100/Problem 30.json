What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?\nChoices:\n  A: It has melted.\n  B: It has sublimated.\n  C: It has evaporated.\n  D: It has condensed.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the process of condensation. I thought that the water vapor in the air would condense into liquid water, not realizing that it would actually sublimate (change directly from a gas to a solid) and form frost.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding of condensation\n* Sublimation vs. condensation\n* Water vapor vs. liquid water\n\nSolution:\nWhen moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air changes directly from a gas to a solid, forming frost. This process is called sublimation.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Recognize that frost forms when moist air meets a cold surface.\n2. Understand that the water vapor in the air sublimates (changes directly from a gas to a solid) to form frost.\n3. Identify the correct answer, \"B: It has sublimated.\"\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Pay attention to the specific process described in the question.\n* Understand the difference between condensation and sublimation.\n* Be careful not to confuse liquid water with water vapor.\n* Double-check your answer by reviewing the process described in the question.\n"
