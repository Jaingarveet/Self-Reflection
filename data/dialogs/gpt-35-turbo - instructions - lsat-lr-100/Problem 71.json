The prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. \nI previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice D, which is false because the curator did not state that Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan to the museum from a private collector. \nTo answer this question correctly, I need to identify the statement that must be true based on the given information. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nThe curator states that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Therefore, every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. The curator also states that prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store. However, the curator does not state that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector. The curator also does not state that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is that every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work."
