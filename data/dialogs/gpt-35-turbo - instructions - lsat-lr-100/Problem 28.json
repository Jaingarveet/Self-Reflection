To weaken the argument, we need to find an option that shows that the situation is not as bad as it seems. Option A is irrelevant because it talks about the overall crime rate, not just violent crime. Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about age, not the town's situation. Option C strengthens the argument because it shows that more people are reporting violent crimes. Option D is irrelevant because it talks about a community center, not the town's situation. Option E weakens the argument because it shows that a small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
