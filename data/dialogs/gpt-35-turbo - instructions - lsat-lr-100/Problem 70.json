But clearly this conclusion is false. After all, the argument Arnot makes for this claim depends on the dubious assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public.\nQuestion: Which one of the following most accurately expresses a flaw in the argument's reasoning?\nChoices:\n  A: it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it\n  B: it treats a change that is required for virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills as a change that will guarantee the virtual elimination of those ills\n  C: it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true\n  D: it distorts the opponent's argument and then attacks this distorted argument\n  E: it uses the key term \"government\" in one sense in a premise and in another sense in the conclusion\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.
