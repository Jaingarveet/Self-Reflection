By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances.\n  B: A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities.\n  C: Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people.\n  D: While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself.\n  E: Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups. People will admire their courage and they will experience the fulfillment of having attempted something that is difficult for them.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the context carefully and understand the principle being discussed.\n2. Read each option carefully and identify the one that most closely conforms to the principle.\n3. Eliminate options that are clearly unrelated to the principle.\n4. Compare the remaining options and choose the one that is most similar to the principle.\n5. Double-check your answer to ensure that it is consistent with the principle.\n"
