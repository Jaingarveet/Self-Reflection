        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin, so it can be represented by the equation $y = mx$, where $m$ is the slope. In this case, the slope is given as $\\frac{1}{7}$.\nTherefore, the equation of the line is $y = \\frac{1}{7}x$.\nNow, let's check the given choices:\n\nA: $(0,7)$\nSubstituting $x = 0$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $y = \\frac{1}{7}x$, we get $7 = 0 \\times \\frac{1}{7}$, which is not true. So, this point does not lie on the line.\n\nB: $(1,7)$\nSubstituting $x = 1$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $y = \\frac{1}{7}x$, we get $7 = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 1$, which is true. So, this point lies on the line.\n\nC: $(7,7)$\nSubstituting $x = 7$ and $y = 7$ into the equation $y = \\frac{1}{7}x$, we get $7 = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 7$, which is not true. So, this point does not lie on the line.\n\nD: $(14,2)$\nSubstituting $x = 14$ and $y = 2$ into the equation $y = \\frac{1}{7}x$, we get $2 = \\frac{1}{7} \\times 14$, which is not true. So, this point does not lie on the line.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the point that lies on the line is $(1,7)$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
