Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\nThe first polynomial is 3x^2 - 5x + 2.\nThe second polynomial is 5x^2 - 2x - 6.\n\nTo add the two polynomials, we need to add the corresponding terms:\n\n* 3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2\n* -5x + 2x = 7x\n* 2 + (-6) = -4\n\nTherefore, the sum of the two polynomials is 8x^2 + 7x - 4.\n\nThe correct answer is choice B: 8x^2 + 7x - 4.\n\nI made a calculation error in my previous response, but I have corrected it now. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and improve my answer."
