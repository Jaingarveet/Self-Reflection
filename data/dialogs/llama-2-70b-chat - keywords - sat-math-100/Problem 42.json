Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe given equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$.\nWe know that $a+b=8$.\nWe can expand the product as follows:\n$$(a x+2)(b x+7) = ab x^{2} + 2bx + 7a x + 14$$\nSince $a+b=8$, we can write $a=4$ and $b=4$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we get:\n$$(4x+2)(4x+7) = 16x^{2} + 28x + 28$$\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n$$16x^{2} + 28x + 28 = 15x^{2} + 14$$\nSubtracting $16x^{2}$ from both sides gives:\n$$12x + 28 = 14$$\nSubtracting $28$ from both sides gives:\n$$12x = 14 - 28$$\n$$12x = -14$$\nDividing both sides by $12$ gives:\n$$x = -14/12$$\nSince $x$ cannot be negative, we have a contradiction.\nTherefore, the given equation has no solutions.\nHence, the correct answer is (D) None of the above.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
