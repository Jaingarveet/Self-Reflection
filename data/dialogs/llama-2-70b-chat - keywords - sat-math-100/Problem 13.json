However, that was a mistake because it led to an incorrect calculation.\n\nNow, let's try to solve it correctly. We have:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$\n\nWe can add $x$ to both sides:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2}=x+x$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2}=2x$$\n\nNow, we can substitute $x=9$:\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2}=2(9)$$\n\n$$\\sqrt{k+2}=18$$\n\nNow, we can take the square root of both sides:\n\n$$k+2=18^2$$\n\nExpanding, we get:\n\n$$k+2=324$$\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n\n$$k=322$$\n\nSo, the value of $k$ is 322.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
