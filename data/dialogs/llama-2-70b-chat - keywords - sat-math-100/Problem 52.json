        "content": "  My apologies for my previous mistake. Let's break down the problem step by step:\nKatarina is a botanist studying the production of pears by two types of pear trees. She noticed that Type A trees produced 20 percent more pears than Type B trees did. Based on Katarina's observation, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, we can let X be the number of pears produced by Type B trees. \nSince Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, we can write an equation:\nType A = Type B + (Type B * 20%)\nType A = Type B + Type B/5\n144 = X + X/5\n5X = 144*5\n5X = 720\nX = 720/5\nX = 144\nTherefore, the Type B trees produced 144 pears.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\nThe correct answer is choice A: 115.\nIn my previous response, I made a calculation error. I mistakenly divided 720 by 5 instead of multiplying it by 5. This led to an incorrect answer. Thank you for pointing out my mistake, and I'll be more careful in my calculations in the future."
