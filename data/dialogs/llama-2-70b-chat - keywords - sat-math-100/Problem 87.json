Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. We can find the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ by solving the system of equations:\n$y=(x-11)^{2}$\n$y=25$\nWe get:\n$x-11=\\pm\\sqrt{25}$\n$x-11=\\pm 5$\n$x=11\\pm 5$\nTherefore, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are:\n$A(11+5, 25)$\n$B(11-5, 25)$\nNow, we can find the length of $\\overline{A B}$ using the distance formula:\n$d=\\sqrt((x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2)$\n$d=\\sqrt((11+5-11-5)^2+(25-25)^2)$\n$d=\\sqrt(10^2+0^2)$\n$d=10\\sqrt{2}$\nThe correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nThe length of $\\overline{A B}$ is 12 units.\nI made a calculation error in my previous response by not simplifying the square root correctly. I also made a distance error by not using the correct coordinates for the points $A$ and $B$. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and correct my mistake."
