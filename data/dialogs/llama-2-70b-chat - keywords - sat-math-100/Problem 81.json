Let's examine the given choices:\n\nA: $(a+2 b)^{2}$\nUsing the distributive property, we can expand the square as:\n$(a+2 b)^{2} = a^{2} + 4 ab + 4 b^{2}$\nWe can see that $4 ab$ and $4 b^{2}$ are both proportional to $y$, so the expression is not equivalent to $4 z + 8 y$.\n\nB: $(2 a+2 b)^{2}$\nSimilarly, using the distributive property, we can expand the square as:\n$(2 a+2 b)^{2} = 4 a^{2} + 8 ab + 4 b^{2}$\nAgain, we can see that $8 ab$ and $4 b^{2}$ are both proportional to $y$, so this expression is also not equivalent to $4 z + 8 y$.\n\nC: $(4 a+4 b)^{2}$\nUsing the distributive property, we can expand the square as:\n$(4 a+4 b)^{2} = 16 a^{2} + 16 ab + 16 b^{2}$\nWe can see that $16 ab$ and $16 b^{2}$ are both proportional to $y$, so this expression is not equivalent to $4 z + 8 y$.\n\nD: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$\nUsing the distributive property, we can expand the square as:\n$(4 a+8 b)^{2} = 16 a^{2} + 32 ab + 64 b^{2}$\nWe can see that $32 ab$ and $64 b^{2}$ are both proportional to $y$, so this expression is equivalent to $4 z + 8 y$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: $(4 a+8 b)^{2}$.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous mistake was due to a calculation error. I incorrectly expanded the squares and missed the fact that $4 ab$ and $4 b^{2}$ were proportional to $y$. This time, I took my time to carefully expand the squares and identified the correct answer."
