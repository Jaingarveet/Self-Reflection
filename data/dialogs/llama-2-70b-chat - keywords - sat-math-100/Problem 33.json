Let's reflect on the problem and the correct answer.\nThe correct answer is indeed option C: $(x-5)^{2}+(y-7)^{2}=2$.\nI made a mistake in my previous answer by not paying attention to the given information. The center of the circle is $(5,7)$, and the radius is 2, so the equation of the circle should have a radius of 2, not 4.\nI also mistakenly used the formula for the equation of a circle with a center at the origin, which is not the case here.\nTo avoid this mistake in the future, I will make sure to carefully read the given information and use the correct formula for the equation of a circle.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
