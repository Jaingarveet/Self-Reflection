Let's analyze the choices again:\n\nA: $300=30 w-60$\nThe left-hand side represents the total amount paid so far, which includes the initial payment of $\\$ 60$. Therefore, the equation should be:\n$300 = 30w + 60$\nThis equation is not represented in choice A.\n\nB: $300=30 w$\nThis equation represents the total amount paid so far without the initial payment of $\\$ 60$. Therefore, it is not suitable for finding the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.\n\nC: $300=30 w+60$\nThis equation is correct. The left-hand side represents the total amount paid so far, including the initial payment of $\\$ 60$. The right-hand side represents the weekly payments made so far.\n\nD: $300=60 w-30$\nThis equation is not correct. The left-hand side represents the total amount paid so far, but the right-hand side does not represent the weekly payments made so far.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: $300=30 w+60$.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
