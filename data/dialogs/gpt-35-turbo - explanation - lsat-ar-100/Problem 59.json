This means that P cannot be performed second, because it would have to be performed before F, which is not possible.\n- If O is performed fifth, then F and S must be performed before R, and T must be performed immediately after R. This means that P cannot be performed sixth, because it would have to be performed after R, which is not possible.\nTherefore, the only possible answer is D: P cannot be performed sixth."
