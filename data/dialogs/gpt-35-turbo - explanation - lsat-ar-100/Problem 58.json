Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?\nChoices:\n  A: grain\n  B: livestock\n  C: machinery\n  D: produce\n  E: textiles\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the bay holding [REDACTED] must be in bay 5 or 6. However, the problem only states that the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], but it does not specify which bays they are in. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect, and my subsequent reasoning was also incorrect.\n"
