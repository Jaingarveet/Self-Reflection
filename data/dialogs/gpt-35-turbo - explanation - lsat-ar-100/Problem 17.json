The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.\nQuestion: If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then which one of the following pairs of days CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy?\nChoices:\n  A: day 1 and day 3\n  B: day 2 and day 6\n  C: day 3 and day 5\n  D: day 4 and day 6\n  E: day 5 and day 7\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI made an error in my reasoning about the possible days that Himalayans could be featured.\nI correctly identified that Himalayans could not be featured on day 1, but I incorrectly assumed that they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.\nThe correct days that Himalayans could be featured are days 2, 4, and 5.\nI also failed to consider the restriction that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.\n"
