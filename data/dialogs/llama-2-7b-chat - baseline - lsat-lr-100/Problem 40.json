Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.\n  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.\n  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.\n  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.\n  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.\n"

        "content": "  The correct answer is (C): Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.\n\nThe argument assumes that the increase in subscription rates is due to the profitability of publishing scholarly journals, but option (C) provides a counterargument. If publishing scholarly journals is not profitable, then the increase in subscription rates cannot be attributed to the profitability of the journals themselves.\n\nOption (A) is irrelevant to the argument, as it only mentions the charging of fines for overdue books and periodicals, which does not affect the argument about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.\n\nOption (B) is also irrelevant, as it only mentions the fraction of the library's operating budget that is dedicated to the acquisition budget, which does not affect the argument about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals.\n\nOption (D) is incorrect, as the subscription rates for individuals have not remained unchanged, but have actually increased over the years.\n\nOption (E) is irrelevant to the argument, as it only mentions the frequency of publication, which does not affect the argument about the profitability of publishing scholarly journals."
