This argument is based on the idea that criticism should reveal important truths about the culture that produced the object being reviewed, and cars do not possess this quality.\n\nOption B supports this argument by stating that reviews cannot be considered criticism unless the objects being reviewed reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This principle aligns with the art critic's argument that cars do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them, and therefore, Paulsen's reviews of cars are not appropriate for the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism."
