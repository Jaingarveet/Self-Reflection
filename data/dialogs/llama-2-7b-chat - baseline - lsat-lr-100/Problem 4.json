        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is (C) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television.\n\nExplanation:\nThe difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in production costs. The average cost of producing an hour of film is significantly higher than the average cost of producing an hour of television. This means that movie executives need to recoup their investment through ticket sales, which requires a larger audience. In contrast, television executives have a lower production cost, which allows them to focus on creating high-quality content that appeals to a smaller audience. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience."
