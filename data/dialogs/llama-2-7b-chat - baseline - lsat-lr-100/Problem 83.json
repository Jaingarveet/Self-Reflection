To determine the conclusion that follows logically, we need to identify the assumption that supports this argument.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") - Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets.\n\nExplanation: The argument implies that Pluto is not a true planet because it formed in orbit around Neptune and was later ejected from that orbit. If Pluto had not been ejected, it would still be considered a moon orbiting Neptune. Therefore, the assumption that not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets logically follows from the argument."
