You walk 10 steps and stop; you reach the ground in 20 minutes.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\nIf you walk 20 steps and stop, you cover 20 steps in 10 minutes.\nThat means, in 1 minute, you cover 20/10 = 2 steps.\n\nIf you walk 10 steps and stop, you cover 10 steps in 20 minutes.\nThat means, in 1 minute, you cover 10/20 = 0.5 steps.\n\nNow, we can calculate the speed of the elevator:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nIn the first case, distance = 20 steps, time = 10 minutes = 10/60 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\nSo, speed = 20/10 = 2 steps/minute.\n\nIn the second case, distance = 10 steps, time = 20 minutes = 20/60 hours.\nSo, speed = 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute.\n\nSince the speed of the elevator is constant, we can take the average of the two speeds:\n\nAverage speed = (2 steps/minute + 0.5 steps/minute) / 2 = 1.5 steps/minute.\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n\nA: 1 step/minute - This is less than the average speed we calculated.\nB: 2 step/minute - This is equal to the average speed we calculated.\nC: 3 step/minute - This is greater than the average speed we calculated.\nD: 4 step/minute - This is greater than the average speed we calculated.\nE: None of the above - This is incorrect since we have found a valid answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
