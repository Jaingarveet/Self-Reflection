After trimming 4 feet off one edge, the rectangle has a length of x - 4 and a width of x.\n3. The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle is 2 \\* 70 = 140 square feet.\n4. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(x - 4) + 2x = 2x - 8.\n5. Since the original square had a perimeter of 4x, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x - 8 = 4x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n2x = 4x + 8\n2x - 4x = 8\nx = 8\n\nSo, the side length of the original square was 8 feet.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
