        "content": "  Let's assume the speed of the ship to be 's' and the speed of the plane to be 'ps', where p is 10.\nThe distance traveled by the ship is given as 180 miles.\nThe distance traveled by the plane is given as x miles.\n\nWe know that the plane starts 180 miles away from the starting point of the ship, so the distance between the ship and the plane at any given time is:\nx - 180\n\nSince the plane is traveling at 10 times the speed of the ship, the time it takes for the plane to cover the distance between the ship and the plane is:\n(x - 180) / (ps - s)\n\nWe want to find the distance when they meet, so we set up the equation:\n(x - 180) / (ps - s) = 1\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\nx - 180 = (ps - s)\nx = (ps - s) + 180\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\nx = (10s - s) + 180\nx = 9s + 180\n\nNow, we have to find the value of s. We know that the ship traveled 180 miles in some time, let's call it t.\nSo, the distance traveled by the ship is:\n180 = st\n\nNow, we can solve for s:\ns = 180 / t\n\nSubstituting the value of s in the equation of x, we get:\nx = 9(180 / t) + 180\nx = 180(9/t) + 180\nx = 180(1 + 9/t)\n\nNow, we have to find the value of x. We know that the plane meets the ship after traveling 289 miles.\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n180(1 + 9/t) = 289\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\nt = 9/10\n\nSubstituting the value of t in the equation of x, we get:\nx = 180(1 + 9/9/10)\nx = 180(1 + 10/9)\nx = 180(11/9)\nx = 200\n\nSo, the distance when they meet from the starting point is 200 miles.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
