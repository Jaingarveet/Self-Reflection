        "content": "  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. A starts a business with Rs.40,000.\n2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000.\n3. C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000.\n4. The total investment now is Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 + Rs.120,000 = Rs.220,000.\n5. The total profit at the end of the year is Rs.375,000.\n6. C gets Rs.150,000 as his share.\n\nNow, let's find the time at which C joined the business.\n\nProfit share of C = Total profit x (C's investment / Total investment)\n\nProfit share of C = Rs.375,000 x (Rs.120,000 / Rs.220,000)\n\nProfit share of C = Rs.375,000 x 0.545\n\nProfit share of C = Rs.199,750\n\nSince C gets Rs.150,000 as his share, the difference between the profit share of C and the actual amount he gets is:\n\nRs.199,750 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.49,750\n\nNow, we need to find the time at which C joined the business.\n\nLet X be the number of months after B joined that C joined.\n\nThe investment of C = Rs.120,000\n\nThe profit share of C = Rs.199,750\n\nThe difference between the profit share of C and the actual amount he gets = Rs.49,750\n\nWe can set up the following equation:\n\nRs.120,000 x (1 + (X/12))^X = Rs.199,750\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n1 + (X/12)^X = 1.66125\n\n(X/12)^X = 1.66125 - 1\n\n(X/12)^X = 0.66125\n\nX = 23\n\nTherefore, C joined the business 23 months after B joined.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
