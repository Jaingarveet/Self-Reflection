The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the week.\n4. The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.\n\nLet X be the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday.\nThen, the hotel orders 2X newspapers the rest of the week.\n\nThe total cost of newspapers for the hotel is:\n4X + (2X)1 + (2X)1 + ... + (2X)1 = 4X + 2X(7) = 11X\n\nSince the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, we can set up the equation:\n11X = 210\n\nSolving for X, we get:\nX = 19\n\nSo, the hotel orders 19 newspapers on Sunday.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
