During a month, both of them makes 35 toys in total. If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob?\nChoices:\n  A: 15\n  B: 16\n  C: 17\n  D: 18\n  E: 19\n"

        "content": "  Let's assume the number of hours Alex works be x.\nSince both Alex and Jacob work for almost a similar number of hours, the number of hours Jacob works is also x.\n\nWe know that Alex makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.\nSimilarly, Jacob makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.\n\nSince both Alex and Jacob work for the same number of hours, the total number of toys they make is the sum of their individual toy-making rates:\n35/x + 35/x = 70/x\n\nNow, we want to find out how many toys Jacob makes. We can set up the following equation:\n70/x = 9(35)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 70/9\nx = 7.78\n\nSince Jacob works for 9 hours, the number of toys he makes is:\n35/x = 35/7.78 = 4.55\n\nSo, Jacob makes 4 toys less than Alex. Therefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
