        "content": "  Let's break this problem down step by step:\n\n1. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.\n2. We can use the formula tan(θ) = h/d, where θ is the angle of elevation, h is the height of the tower, and d is the distance from the car to the tower.\n3. We know that the angle of elevation changes by 15° (60° - 45° = 15°) in 10 minutes.\n4. We can use the fact that the angle of elevation changes by 15° to find the rate at which the angle of elevation changes: 15°/10 minutes = 1.5° per minute.\n5. We can use the formula d = h/tan(θ) to find the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°: d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.\n6. We can use the fact that the angle of elevation changes by 1.5° per minute to find the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°: time = 15°/1.5° per minute = 10 minutes.\n7. We can use the formula d = h/tan(θ) to find the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°: d = h/tan(60°) = h/√3.\n8. We can use the fact that the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° is equal to the distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° to find the height of the tower: h = d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.\n9. We can use the formula d = h/tan(θ) to find the distance from the car to the tower: d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.\n10. We can use the fact that the car is moving at a uniform speed to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower: time = distance/speed = h/1/speed.\n11. We can use the fact that the angle of elevation changes by 1.5° per minute to find the speed of the car: speed = distance/time = h/10.\n12. We can now plug in the values we have found into the given choices to find the correct answer:\n\nA: 5(√3 + 1) = 5(1.732 + 1) = 5(2.732) = 13.66. This is not the correct answer.\n\nB: 6(√3 + √2) = 6(1.732 + 1.414) = 6(3.146) = 18.876. This is not the correct answer.\n\nC: 7(√3 – 1) = 7(1.732 - 1) = 7(0.732) = 5.124. This is not the correct answer.\n\nD: 8(√3 – 2) = 8(1.732 - 2) = 8(0.732) = 5.864. This is not the correct answer.\n\nE: None of these. This is not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
