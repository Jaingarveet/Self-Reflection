John replaces 15% of the tea with milk twice, which means he replaces 15% of the tea with milk once.\n\nThe concentration of the tea after the first time replacing 15% of it with milk is:\n\n50% - (15% of 50%) = 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%\n\n3. Now, John replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk.\n\nThe concentration of the tea after the second time replacing 10% of it with milk is:\n\n42.5% - (10% of 42.5%) = 42.5% - 4.25% = 38.25%\n\nTherefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 38.25%.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
