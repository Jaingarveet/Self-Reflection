        "content": "  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time it took him to reach B is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = B - A / 70\n\n2. Since he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to return to A is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = A - B / 90\n\n3. We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nTime = 3 hours\nDistance = 70 miles\nSpeed = 70 mph\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\n\nWe can solve for distance:\n\nDistance = Time x Speed\nDistance = 3 x 70\nDistance = 210 miles\n\n4. Since Kevin drove from A to B and then returned to A, the total distance traveled is twice the distance between A and B:\n\nTotal distance = 2 x Distance\nTotal distance = 2 x 210\nTotal distance = 420 miles\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n\nA: 180 miles - Too small\nB: 90 miles - Too small\nC: 270 miles - Too small\nD: 360 miles - Too large\nE: None of the above - Incorrect, there is a valid answer\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"420\")"
