Since we know the radius (10 cm), we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle: circumference = 2 x pi x radius\n\nCircumference = 2 x pi x 10 cm = 20 pi cm\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance: distance = circumference x time\n\nDistance = 20 pi cm x 30 seconds = 600 pi cm\n\nSince the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, we need to convert the time from seconds to minutes:\n\n30 seconds / 60 = 0.5 minutes\n\nNow, we can use the formula for distance: distance = circumference x time\n\nDistance = 20 pi cm x 0.5 minutes = 10 pi cm\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 10 pi cm.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
