So, there are 3 ways to travel from M to N.\n* From N to O, there are 4 buses. So, there are 4 ways to travel from N to O.\n* From O to P, there is only 1 bus. So, there is only 1 way to travel from O to P.\n* From P to Q, there are 3 buses. So, there are 3 ways to travel from P to Q.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of ways to travel from M to Q. We can do this by multiplying the number of ways for each leg:\n\n3 (ways from M to N) x 4 (ways from N to O) x 1 (way from O to P) x 3 (ways from P to Q) = 3 x 4 x 1 x 3 = 36\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
