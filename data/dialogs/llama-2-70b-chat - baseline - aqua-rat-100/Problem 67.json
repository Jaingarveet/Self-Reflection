Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, so the ratio of rolls to baguettes is 3:5 or 1:1.\n3. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as x pita breads. We want to find the value of x.\n\nNow, we can set up a system of equations using the ratios we've identified:\n\n6 pita breads = 2 rolls (1)\n3 rolls = 5 baguettes (2)\n2 baguettes = x pita breads (3)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by substituting equation (1) into equation (3):\n\n2 baguettes = x pita breads\n2 baguettes = 6 pita breads / 2 (from equation 1)\nx = 6 / 2\nx = 3\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
