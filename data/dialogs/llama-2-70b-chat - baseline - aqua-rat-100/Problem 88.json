This means the train travels a total distance of 1000 miles (10 x 100).\n3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, which is 250 miles (1/4 x 1000).\n4. The time taken to cover the remaining distance of 750 miles (1000 - 250) at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:\n\nTime = Distance / Speed\nTime = 750 / 75\nTime = 10\n\n5. The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance:\n\nTotal Time = 10 + 10\nTotal Time = 20\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
