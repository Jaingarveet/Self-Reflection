His new batting average will be 54.\n\nWe can use the formula for finding the average to solve this problem:\naverage = (sum of all values)/(number of values)\n\nWe know that Sachin's current average is 51, so the sum of all values is 51*x, where x is the number of matches he has played.\n\nAfter the finals, his average becomes 54, so the sum of all values becomes 54*x + 78.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n51*x = 54*x + 78\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 9\n\nSo, Sachin has played 9 matches in this season.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
