We can arrange the books in different ways by changing their positions.\n\nTo calculate the number of ways to arrange the books, we use the concept of permutation.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange n objects in a row is given by the formula n! (read as n factorial), where n is the number of objects.\n\nIn this case, we have 7 books - English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, Science, and a shelf.\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the books on the shelf is 7!.\n\n7! = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040\n\nSo, the answer is 5040.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
