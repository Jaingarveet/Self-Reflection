        "content": "  Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.\n2. For each additional quarter-mile, the cost is 10 cents.\n3. We can calculate the cost for each mile by multiplying the number of quarter-miles by 10 cents and adding $3.50.\n4. The maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is found by dividing $8.50 by the cost per mile.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per mile:\n\n1 quarter-mile = $3.50\n2 quarter-miles = $3.50 + 10 cents = $3.60\n3 quarter-miles = $3.60 + 10 cents = $3.70\n4 quarter-miles = $3.70 + 10 cents = $3.80\n5 quarter-miles = $3.80 + 10 cents = $3.90\n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum distance:\n\nMaximum distance = $8.50 / $3.90 = 2.18 miles\n\nSince we can't travel a fraction of a mile, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\") 12.75 miles."
