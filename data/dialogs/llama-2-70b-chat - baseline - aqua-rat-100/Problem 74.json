We can do this in 5C4 ways (5 choose 4) = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 = 120 ways.\n\nSince we are counting each quadrilateral only once, we must divide the result by the number of ways to rotate the quadrilateral. There are four ways to rotate a quadrilateral: by 90, 180, 270, or 360 degrees. Therefore, we must divide 120 by 4, which gives us 30.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
