So, the new amounts will be:\n\nArjun: x - 30\nSajal: 2(x - 30) + y\n\nWe also know that if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice the amount of money that Sajal has left. So, the new amounts will be:\n\nArjun: 3(y - 10) + x\nSajal: y - 10\n\nWe can set up a system of linear equations using these two equations:\n\n2(x - 30) + y = 3(y - 10) + x\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x - 60 = 3y - 30\n\nSolving for x and y, we get:\n\nx = 62\ny = 34\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
