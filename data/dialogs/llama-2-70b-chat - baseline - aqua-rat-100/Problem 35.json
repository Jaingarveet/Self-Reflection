The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.\n\nTo find the required sale, we need to first find the commission earned by the servant.\n\nCommission = Monthly sale x Commission percentage\nCommission = Monthly sale x 15%\nCommission = Monthly sale x 0.15\n\nNow, we can set up an equation using the information given:\n\nMonthly salary + Commission = Monthly income\n1500 + Commission = 6000\n\nWe can solve for the commission:\n\nCommission = 6000 - 1500\nCommission = 4500\n\nNow, we can use the equation we set up earlier to solve for the monthly sale:\n\nMonthly sale = Commission / Commission percentage\nMonthly sale = 4500 / 0.15\nMonthly sale = 30,000\n\nTherefore, the servant should do a sale of 30,000 rupees to get a monthly income of 6000 rupees.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
