There are z students in the class, where z > 5.\n\nWe can start by finding the sum of the scores. Let's say the highest score is H and the lowest score is L. Then, the sum of all z scores can be represented as:\nS = H + L + (z - 2) \\* (y - H/2)\n\nWe know that the average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so we can write:\nx = (H + L)/2\n\nWe also know that the average score for the entire class is y, so we can write:\ny = (S)/z\n\nNow, we want to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. We can do this by subtracting the highest and lowest scores from the sum and then dividing by the number of scores remaining:\nAverage = (S - H - L)/(z - 2)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions we derived earlier:\nAverage = [(H + L + (z - 2) \\* (y - H/2)) - H - L]/ (z - 2)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\nAverage = (zx - 2)/(z - 2)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is choice D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2).\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
