        "content": "  Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The length of the rectangle is 1m more than 4 times the breadth.\n2. Let's call the breadth x. Then, the length is 4x + 1.\n3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m.\n4. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length and breadth. So, we can set up the equation: (4x + 1)x = 150.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0.\n6. Factoring the equation, we get (2x + 75)(2x - 6) = 0.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = -75/2 or x = 6/2.\n8. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we know that x = 6/2 = 3.\n9. Now, we can find the length: 4x + 1 = 4(3) + 1 = 13.\n10. Finally, we can find the perimeter: 2(l + w) = 2(13 + 3) = 2(16) = 32 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
