I calculated the weight of the object on each planet using the acceleration due to gravity on that planet, but I did not convert the weight to newtons. As a result, my answer was incorrect.\nTo answer this question correctly, I will need to use the formula $W=mg$ and convert the weight of the object on Earth to kilograms. Then, I can use the acceleration due to gravity on each planet to calculate the weight of the object on that planet. Finally, I will need to convert the weight of the object on each planet to newtons.\nThought:\nThe weight of an object on Earth is 150 newtons.\nThe acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}$.\nThe mass of the object on Earth is $m=\\frac{W}{g}=\\frac{150 \\text{ newtons}}{9.8 \\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}}}=15.31 \\text{ kg}$.\nThe weight of the object on Venus is $W=mg=(15.31 \\text{ kg})(8.9 \\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}})=136 \\text{ newtons}$.\nThe weight of the object on Saturn is $W=mg=(15.31 \\text{ kg})(11.1 \\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}})=169 \\text{ newtons}$.\nThe weight of the object on Uranus is $W=mg=(15.31 \\text{ kg})(10.7 \\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}})=163 \\text{ newtons}$.\nThe weight of the object on Neptune is $W=mg=(15.31 \\text{ kg})(14.1 \\frac{m}{\\sec ^{2}})=216 \\text{ newtons}$.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
