This led to an incorrect value for $k$.\n**Correction:** I will carefully review my calculations and double-check the signs and coefficients at each step.\n## Solution:\nTo find the value of $k$ for which the system has no solution, we can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's eliminate $y$:\n1. Multiply the first equation by $\\frac{5}{3}$:\n$$\\frac{5}{3}kx - 5y = \\frac{20}{3}$$\n2. Multiply the second equation by $-1$:\n$$-4x + 5y = -7$$\n3. Add the two equations:\n$$\\frac{5}{3}kx - 4x = \\frac{13}{3}$$\n4. Solve for $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{13}{5k + 12}$$\nFor the system to have no solution, the value of $x$ must be undefined. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction is equal to zero:\n$$5k + 12 = 0$$\n$$k = -\\frac{12}{5}$$\nTherefore, the value of $k$ for which the system has no solution is $-\\frac{12}{5}$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
