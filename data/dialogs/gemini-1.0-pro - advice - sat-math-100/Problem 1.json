I will use my self-reflection to answer this question correctly.\n**Self-reflection:**\n* **Mistake:** I initially chose answer A, which was incorrect.\n* **Reason for mistake:** I did not pay close attention to the units of each term in the equation.\n* **Correct approach:** To find $v$, we need to isolate it in the equation. We can do this by moving all other terms to the right-hand side of the equation.\n**Solution:**\n```\nh = -16t^2 + vt + k\nh - k = -16t^2 + vt\nh - k + 16t^2 = vt\n(h - k + 16t^2)/t = v\n```\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")**"
