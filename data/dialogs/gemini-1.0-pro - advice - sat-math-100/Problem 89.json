The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.\nQuestion: Graphene, which is used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, is so thin that a sheet weighing one ounce can cover up to 7 football fields. If a football field has an area of approximately $1 \\frac{1}{3}$ acres, about how many acres could 48 ounces of graphene cover?\nChoices:\n  A: 250\n  B: 350\n  C: 450\n  D: 1,350\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to units and ensure they are consistent throughout the calculations.\n- Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.\n- Double-check your calculations and reasoning before arriving at a final answer.\n- Consider alternative approaches or estimations to verify your answer.\n- Be mindful of common errors such as calculation mistakes, unit conversion errors, and misinterpretations of the problem.\n"
