Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:\n$$0 = m \\cdot 0$$\nThis implies that $m = 0$.\nNow, we can use the slope to find the value of $k$:\n$$0 = \\frac{32 - k}{k - 2}$$\n$$0 = 32 - k$$\n$$k = 32$$\nTherefore, the value of $k$ that makes the line pass through the origin is 32.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \n"
