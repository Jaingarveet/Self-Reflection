I also did not remember that the slope of a linear function represents the rate of change of the function.\nI will now analyze the table of values and use the information to determine the correct answer.\nAnalysis:\nThe output value increases by 3 for each increase of 1 in the input value. This means that the slope of the linear function is 3.\nThe output value is -2 when the input value is 1. This means that the y-intercept of the linear function is -2.\nTherefore, the linear function is $f(n)=3 n-2$.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
