[step] You will need six to eight sheets of craft paper to make the dreidels. Pick craft paper that has an interesting design, such as hebrew letters, or a plain design if you are planning on decorating the dreidels later.\nChoices:\n  A: Go for paper that is thick and durable as you will be gluing them together. [substeps] You can also use colored craft paper in a certain color scheme, such as blue and yellow, if you do not plan on decorating them later.\n  B: [substeps] Choose paper that has no patterns or embellishments. You want the paper to be smooth and no hairs or wrinkles are present.\n  C: [substeps] Craft paper typically comes in multiple shapes and colors. If your craft paper has one shape, like blossoms, flowers, animals, and designs, choose an array to paint the dreidels on.\n  D: You may wish to make your garland smaller based on how strong the paper is, or you may use more narrow representations such as images, writing utensils or sequins. [substeps] If you plan on making the garland from scratch, craft paper is preferred.\n"

Option A suggests using thick and durable paper, which is appropriate for a garland that will be handled and used for an extended period. The other options do not provide the same level of durability or practicality, making option A the best choice.\n\nOption B suggests choosing paper with no patterns or embellishments, which may not provide the desired aesthetic for a decorative garland. Option C suggests using craft paper with various shapes and colors, which may not be suitable for a garland that requires a consistent design. Option D suggests using smaller or more narrow representations, which may not be practical for a garland that needs to be visible and sturdy."
