Keep in mind that several companies have hired dog walkers in the past and you may be able to conduct an additional background check to determine if your company is accepting permits.\n  B: [substeps] Keep in mind, however, that you can start your own business already, which may seem like a lot of work to have. [title] Find a place where you can spend a lot of time.\n  C: This can be a way to both learn about the business and animal safety.

Option C continues this train of thought by suggesting that working for an agency can also be a way to learn about animal safety and that it can lead to starting your own business in the long run. Option A is not related to the topic of dog walking. Option B suggests starting your own business, but it does not align with the text's suggestion of working for an agency first. Option D does not make sense in the context of the text."
