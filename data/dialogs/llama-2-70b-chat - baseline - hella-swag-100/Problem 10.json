[step] Losing patience with your dog can cause them to be confused. Your dog may not know what you want or how you will react if they do something.\nChoices:\n  A: If you are busy with work and are away from home, time will slip away from your dog and ruin their routine. [substeps] Not knowing what you want or how you will react may cause them to have a hard time adjusting to being patient.\n  B: This delay is why it's important to always be consistent with your commands. [substeps] Try letting your dog know there are positive things they can do and make sure you reward them each time they do something right.\n  C: By being consistently patient, you help keep your dog from getting confused. [substeps] For example, if you are patient one day while doing something with them, but then yell and get frustrated the next day, the dog will be confused and not know how to act.\n  D: Make sure your dog knows what you want before you begin. [substeps] Give your dog patience to follow you.\n"

Choice B emphasizes the importance of consistency in commands to avoid confusing the dog. It suggests rewarding the dog for positive behavior, which promotes a positive relationship between the dog and its owner.\n\nChoice A does not relate to the topic of being patient with dogs.\n\nChoice C is partially correct, but it does not offer a solution to the problem of the dog getting confused.\n\nChoice D is not directly related to the topic of being patient with dogs.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B."
