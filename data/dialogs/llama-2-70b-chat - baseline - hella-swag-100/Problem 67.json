Choice B states that if there is no index number, the radical is understood to be a square root (index 2) and can be multiplied with other square roots. This is the most likely completion to the text as it provides a clear explanation of how to multiply radicals with no index number.\n\nChoice A is not relevant to the context and seems to be introducing a new concept. Choice C is also not relevant as it talks about multiplying the index number from top to bottom for each column, which is not related to multiplying radicals. Choice D is a vague statement and does not provide any useful information."
