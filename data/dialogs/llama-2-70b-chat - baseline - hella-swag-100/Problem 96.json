[substeps] Before planting your vegetables in april or june, begin checking them every second day to make sure the soil is even.\n  C: During the growing season, using a frost rake every six to seven weeks is ideal. [substeps] Rows should be spaced with patches of grass spaced about two or three feet apart, and that grass should fall between 12-12 inches (30-61 cm) in length.\n  D: [substeps] If your plants are grown in the late spring or summer, wait for a temperature that's between 30 and 35 degrees fahrenheit (4 to 5 degrees celsius) for the ripen phase to improve growth.

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"A\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe text suggests that the plants should be planted in late spring or early summer to avoid early flowering from exposure to cold temperatures. Therefore, it makes sense to store the seeds in a warm, dry location while waiting to plant them. This will help to ensure that the seeds are not exposed to cold temperatures that could cause them to flower prematurely. Additionally, planting the seeds indoors and then moving them outside when the weather improves is a good way to get a head start on the growing season.\n\nThe other options do not relate to the topic of growing biennial vegetables or are not logical extensions of the given text. Option B is incorrect because it does not address the issue of frost exposure and flowering. Option C is unrelated to the topic of growing biennial vegetables and is not a logical extension of the given text. Option D is incorrect because it refers to a temperature range that is not relevant to the growth of biennial vegetables."
