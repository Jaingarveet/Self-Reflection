[title] Bring a 9 \" x 5 \" square.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe text suggests that the reader can use natural items as dowsing or divining rods, such as tree branches or sticks. It also mentions that diviners use forked sticks from trees like willow, peach, and witch hazel. Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be option B, which suggests looking for a stick with a fork and branches of equal length on either end. This option aligns with the natural and homemade nature of the dowsing rods mentioned in the text.\n\nOption A talks about using exaggerated branches or canes, but this is not the most likely completion as it does not align with the natural and homemade nature of the dowsing rods mentioned in the text.\n\nOption C suggests buying a dowsing rod in a hardware store or hunting store, but this is not the most likely completion as the text suggests using natural items or homemade alternatives.\n\nOption D is not related to the topic of dowsing or divining rods and therefore is not a suitable completion."
