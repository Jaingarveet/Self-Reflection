[substeps] Alternatively, you may find that your partner is using abusive language to justify his or her abuse and you try writing a story about the abuse.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nRationale:\nWriting the story in the third person can help the individual gain perspective on the relationship and see it from an outsider's point of view. This can help them identify patterns of abuse or dysfunction that they may not have noticed before. It also allows them to see themselves as a separate entity from the relationship, which can help them break the trauma bond.\n\nThe other options do not offer the same level of perspective-taking and distancing from the relationship, which is the goal of this step in breaking a trauma bond. Option A focuses on highlighting the unique aspects of the relationship, but does not provide the same level of objectivity as writing in the third person. Option C focuses on the initial impression of the relationship, but does not necessarily provide insight into the dynamics of the relationship. Option D suggests including visual aids and facts to support the story, but does not address the issue of perspective-taking."
