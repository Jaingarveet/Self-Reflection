However, the correct answer is option D, which states that the object will move in the same direction as the larger force.\n\nThe reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the concept of forces acting in opposite directions.

This is because the net force acting on the object is the vector sum of the two forces, and the larger force will dominate the motion of the object.\n\nTo calculate the acceleration of the object, we can use the formula F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. Since the larger force is acting in the same direction as the acceleration, the object will accelerate in that direction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D, which states that the object will move in the same direction as the larger force.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the concept of forces acting in opposite directions\n* Confusion between equal and opposite forces\n\nSolution:\nWhen two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force.
