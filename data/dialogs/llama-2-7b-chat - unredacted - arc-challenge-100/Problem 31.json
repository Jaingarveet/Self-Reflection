However, the correct answer is option D, which states that the Sun has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.\n\nThe reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the context of the question.

As a result, I overlooked the important detail provided in the question about the Sun's expected fuel exhaustion in the future.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding context\n* Overlooking important details\n\nSolution:\nTo solve the problem correctly, I should have read the question more carefully and considered the Sun's entire life cycle, rather than just its current energy state.
