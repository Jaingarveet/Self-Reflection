New moon occurs every 29.5 days, which is approximately every three months. However, new seasons occur every 3 months, as the Earth takes approximately 3 months to complete one orbit around the Sun.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Season\n* Orbit\n* Sun\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Identify the frequency of new moon: every 29.5 days\n2. Determine the frequency of new seasons: every 3 months\n3.
