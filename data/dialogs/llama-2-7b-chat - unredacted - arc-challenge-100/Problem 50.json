A thermometer is indeed the tool that is used to measure the temperature of a liquid, but a stopwatch is not necessary to determine the boiling point of a liquid. The boiling point of a liquid can be determined by measuring the time it takes for the liquid to reach its boiling point, using a stopwatch.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Misunderstanding the task\n* Incorrect tool selection\n\nSolution:\nTo determine the boiling point of a liquid, a student must use a thermometer.\nThe student must measure the temperature of the liquid at regular intervals, using a thermometer, until the liquid reaches its boiling point.
