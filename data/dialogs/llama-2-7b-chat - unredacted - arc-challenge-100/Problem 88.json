What should Michelle do next?\nChoices:\n  A: perform the investigation in a different way\n  B: change the hypothesis to match the results\n  C: choose a different investigation\n  D: repeat the investigation\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI selected option A, \"perform the investigation in a different way,\" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option is not the best choice.\n\nWhen the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations.

However, if the results do not match the hypothesis, it is important to consider alternative explanations and revise the hypothesis accordingly.\n\nOption C, \"choose a different investigation,\" is not the best choice because it does not address the issue of the discrepancy between the results and the hypothesis.\n\nOption D, \"repeat the investigation,\" is a good choice because it allows Michelle to gather more data and potentially obtain more accurate results.
