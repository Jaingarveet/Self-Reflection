The correct answer is indeed (D) the squeezing of food through the intestines.\n\nThe process of digestion involves the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices, but this does not indicate a physical change. The digestive juices in the stomach and small intestine do not physically change the food, but rather break down its molecular bonds through chemical reactions.\n\nThe squeezing of food through the intestines, on the other hand, is a physical process that occurs after the food has been broken down. The intestines contract and relax to move the digested food through the digestive system, and this process can be considered a physical change.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) the squeezing of food through the intestines.\n\nKeywords: digestion, digestive juices, molecular bonds, physical change, intestines.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Identify the process of digestion.\n2. Determine which of the options provided indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion.\n3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.\n4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Break down complex questions into simpler steps to solve them.\n* Think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your answers to ensure accuracy.\n* Remember that physical changes are changes that occur in the physical state of a substance, such as the breakdown of molecular bonds.\n"
