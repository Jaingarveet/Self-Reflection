I realized that I misunderstood the density of the red-clay bricks and the volume of the air.\n\nThe density of red-clay bricks is approximately 2000 kg/m^3, and the density of air is 1 kg/m^3.\n\nTo find the lowest mass, we need to compare the mass of 2 m^3 of bricks and 6000 m^3 of air.\n\nThe mass of 2 m^3 of bricks is 2 x 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg.\n\nThe mass of 6000 m^3 of air is 6000 x 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg.\n\nTherefore, the lowest mass is 6000 kg, which is option (C).\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
