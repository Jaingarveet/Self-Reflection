Here's how you can answer the question correctly:\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe skin is considered an organ because it is made up of tissues that work together to perform specific functions. The skin is composed of several layers of tissues, including the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, which work together to protect the body from external factors, regulate body temperature, and facilitate sensation.
