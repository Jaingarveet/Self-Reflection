Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house.\nQuestion: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection?\nChoices:\n  A: Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors.\n  B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.\n  C: The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.\n  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.\n  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the argument and the scope of the discussion. I focused on the relationship between the wealthy and ninjas, neglecting the core point about the prevalence of fear among the general population. I also overlooked the importance of demographic proportions in assessing the extent of this fear.\n"

Tamara counters by stating that many wealthy Japanese took precautions against ninjas by constructing squeaky floors.\n\nPatricia can counter Tamara's objection by providing evidence that the wealthy, who took these precautions, made up a small portion of Japan's population during that time. This would suggest that the majority of Japanese people did not fear ninjas, as they did not find it necessary to take such precautions.\n\nThe correct answer is therefore Choice \"C\".\n\nAnswer: C"
