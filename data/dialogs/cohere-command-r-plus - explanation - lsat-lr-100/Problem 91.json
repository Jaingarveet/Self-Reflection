Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.\nQuestion: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above?\nChoices:\n  A: Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others.\n  B: No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.\n  C: Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.\n  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.\n  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the main point of the passage and focused on the idea that not all allergy sufferers will react to every cat. However, the key point is the variation in proteins across cats, which directly supports statement [REDACTED].\n"

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice \"C\".\n\nStatement \"A\" is incorrect because the passage does not provide information on breeds; it discusses cats in general.\nStatement \"B\" is incorrect and misleading. While it is true that no single cat can cause a reaction in all allergy sufferers, this is because of variations in human allergies, not because of variations among cats, as the statement implies.\nStatement \"D\" is incorrect because the passage does not provide any information about the intensity of allergic reactions.\nStatement \"E\" is incorrect because, while it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy whether a given cat will cause a reaction in a specific individual, the passage implies that by understanding the specific proteins that trigger a person's allergies, one could make an educated prediction about the likelihood of a reaction.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
