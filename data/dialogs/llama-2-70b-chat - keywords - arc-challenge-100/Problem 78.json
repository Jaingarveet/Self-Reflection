I overlooked the structure and composition of the skin, focusing solely on its function as a barrier.\n\nThe correct answer is \"C: It is made of tissues.\"\n\nThe skin is composed of multiple layers of epithelial, connective, and muscle tissues, which work together to perform various functions such as protection, regulation of body temperature, and sensation. The skin's structure, made up of these tissues, allows it to carry out its functions effectively.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
