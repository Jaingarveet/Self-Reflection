I misunderstood the concept of physical change and had a misconception of the digestion process.\n\nThe correct answer is C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices.\n\nDuring digestion, food substances are broken down into smaller molecules by digestive enzymes, which is a physical change. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
