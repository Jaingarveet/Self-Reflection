Upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the question stem and failed to carefully read the options. I thought the question was asking for an example of an animal instinct, but it's actually asking for an example of something that is not an animal instinct.\n\nThe correct answer is option D, \"building nests.\" Building nests is not an instinctive behavior, but rather a learned behavior that some animals acquire through experience and practice.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
