I also failed to conduct a complete analysis of the patient's history and current condition.\n\nThought:\nAn unstable lie at 34 weeks of gestation can be caused by several factors, including oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, or uterine anomalies. However, the patient is a multigravida with two previous normal deliveries, which makes uterine anomalies less likely. Placenta previa is also less likely since it usually presents with vaginal bleeding, which is not mentioned in the question. A pelvic tumor could cause an unstable lie, but it is a rare occurrence. Oligohydramnios is a possibility, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nReflection:\nUpon further reflection, I realized that I overlooked the possibility of uterine anomalies as a cause of unstable lie. Although it is less likely in a multigravida with two previous normal deliveries, it is still a possibility that cannot be ruled out without further evaluation. Therefore, the correct answer is \"D: Uterine anomalies.\""
