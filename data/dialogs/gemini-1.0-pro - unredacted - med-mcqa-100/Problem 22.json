While Vertucci's system is widely used for root canal anatomy, the specific classification of the isthmus was developed by Kim.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misidentification\n* Confusion of classifications\n* Incomplete knowledge of dental anatomy\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the specific aspect of root canal anatomy being classified.** In this case, it is the isthmus.\n2. **Recall the different classification systems for root canal anatomy.** This includes Vertucci, Schilder, and Kim.\n3. **Match the specific aspect (isthmus) with the corresponding classification system (Kim).**\n4. **Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct classification (Kim).**\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. When encountering a question about specific anatomical classifications, identify the exact structure or feature being classified.\n2. Recall the different classification systems relevant to the topic.\n3. Match the specific structure/feature with the appropriate classification system.\n4. Choose the answer that corresponds to the correct classification system.\n**General Advice:**\n* Maintain a strong understanding of the various classification systems used in dentistry.\n* Practice active recall of specific classifications and their corresponding structures/features.\n* When unsure, refer to reliable sources for accurate information.\n* Avoid making assumptions or relying solely on partial knowledge.\n"
