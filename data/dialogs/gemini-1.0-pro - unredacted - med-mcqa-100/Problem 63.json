This error stemmed from a misunderstanding of the inheritance pattern of the disease.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the inheritance pattern of HVDRR.\n* **Autosomal vs. X-linked:** I confused the difference between autosomal and X-linked inheritance.\n* **Dominant vs. Recessive:** I did not correctly identify HVDRR as a dominant disorder.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the correct inheritance pattern:** HVDRR is an X-linked dominant disorder. This means that the mutated gene responsible for the disease is located on the X chromosome, and only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disease.\n2. **Consider the implications of X-linked inheritance:** In males, who have only one X chromosome, inheriting a single copy of the mutated gene will result in the disease. In females, who have two X chromosomes, inheriting one mutated copy may not be enough to cause the disease, as the normal copy on the other X chromosome can compensate. However, females with one mutated copy are carriers and have a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to their children.\n3. **Choose the answer that reflects the correct inheritance pattern:** Based on the understanding that HVDRR is an X-linked dominant disorder, the correct answer is **C: XD**.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. **Carefully read and understand the question:** Pay close attention to the specific details of the disease or condition being described.\n2. **Review the inheritance patterns of genetic disorders:** Refresh your knowledge on autosomal vs. X-linked inheritance and dominant vs. recessive inheritance patterns.\n3. **Consider the implications of each inheritance pattern:** Analyze how the inheritance pattern affects the expression of the disease in males and females.\n4. **Choose the answer that aligns with the correct inheritance pattern:** Select the answer that accurately reflects the mode of inheritance for the given disease.\n**General Advice for Solving Similar Problems:**\n* **Strengthen your understanding of basic genetic principles:** Ensure a solid foundation in concepts like genes, chromosomes, alleles, and inheritance patterns.\n* **Practice solving genetics problems:** Engage in regular practice with various genetics problems to solidify your understanding and application of these concepts.\n* **Consult reliable resources:** Refer to reputable textbooks, articles, and online resources for accurate information on genetic disorders and their inheritance patterns.\n* **Seek clarification when needed:** Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or additional information if you encounter any uncertainties. \n* **Double-check your answers:** Carefully review your answers before submitting them to minimize errors.\n"
