Choose the answer that reflects this understanding.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. Carefully read and analyze the entire question, including all modifiers and implications.\n2. Break down complex concepts into simpler components.\n3. Define key terms and ensure a clear understanding of their meaning.\n4. Consider all aspects of the question before formulating an answer.\n5. Double-check your understanding and reasoning before selecting a final answer.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* Pay close attention to the specific wording and context of the question.\n* Actively seek clarification if any part of the question is unclear.\n* Utilize critical thinking skills to analyze the information provided.\n* Apply knowledge and understanding of relevant concepts to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n* Maintain a cautious approach and avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.\n"
