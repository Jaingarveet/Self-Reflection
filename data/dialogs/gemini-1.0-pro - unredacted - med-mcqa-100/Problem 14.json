While NADH is indeed a crucial intermediate in the process, it is not considered an end product. \n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the question's request for \"end products\" and included an intermediate molecule.\n* **Incomplete knowledge:** My understanding of the final steps of anaerobic glycolysis was incomplete, leading to the inclusion of NADH.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the key steps of anaerobic glycolysis:** This involves understanding the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate without the presence of oxygen.\n2. **Recognize the end products:** The final products of this process are 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules. \n3. **Differentiate between intermediates and end products:** NADH acts as an electron carrier within the pathway and is not considered a final product.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. **Carefully read and understand the question:** Pay close attention to keywords like \"end product\" to avoid misinterpretations.\n2. **Review the specific metabolic pathway:** Thoroughly understand the steps involved in anaerobic glycolysis and identify the final products.\n3. **Distinguish between intermediates and end products:** Clearly differentiate between molecules that participate in the pathway and those that represent the final outcome.\n4. **Double-check your answer:** Before submitting, review your answer to ensure it aligns with the question and your understanding of the metabolic process.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* **Strengthen foundational knowledge:** Ensure a solid understanding of the relevant biochemical pathways and their components.\n* **Practice active recall:** Regularly test your knowledge through practice questions and self-quizzing.\n* **Seek clarification when needed:** Don't hesitate to consult reliable sources or experts if you encounter uncertainties.\n* **Focus on critical thinking:** Develop the ability to analyze information, identify key details, and draw accurate conclusions.\nBy following these steps and incorporating the general advice, I can improve my accuracy in answering similar questions related to biochemistry and other scientific disciplines.\n"
