Biopsy finding is also shown below. What is your diagnosis?\nChoices:\n  A: Rhinoscleroma\n  B: Wegener's granulomatosis\n  C: Stewa's granuloma\n  D: Rhinosporidiosis\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Explanation:\nMy initial diagnosis of Rhinoscleroma was incorrect. While the patient's symptoms and the presence of Mikulicz cells in the biopsy are suggestive of Rhinoscleroma, the additional information about blood-tinged nasal discharge points towards a different diagnosis. \n## Error Keywords:\n* Overlooking key information (blood-tinged discharge)\n* Focusing on a single aspect of the presentation (Mikulicz cells)\n* Incomplete analysis of clinical and pathological findings\n## Solution:\n1. **Review all clinical features:** Right-sided nasal obstruction, nasal discharge (sometimes blood-tinged)\n2. **Analyze the biopsy findings:** Mikulicz cells are present, but consider other possible causes.\n3. **Consider the blood-tinged discharge:** This is a crucial clue that suggests a different diagnosis.\n4. **Compare the findings with all answer choices:** \n    * Rhinoscleroma typically does not cause blood-tinged discharge.\n    * Wegener's granulomatosis can cause bloody discharge but is less likely due to the absence of other typical features.\n    * Stewa's granuloma is a rare condition with different clinical and pathological features.\n    * **Rhinosporidiosis:** This fungal infection commonly presents with nasal polyps, blood-tinged discharge, and Mikulicz cells in the biopsy. \n5. **Based on the comprehensive analysis, Rhinosporidiosis is the most likely diagnosis.**\n## Instructions for future cases:\n1. **Pay close attention to all clinical features and laboratory findings.**\n2. **Do not rely on a single finding for diagnosis.**\n3. **Consider all possible diagnoses and compare them with the patient's presentation.**\n4. **Use additional resources and consult with colleagues when needed.**\n5. **Be aware of your limitations and seek further information or expertise when necessary.**\n## General advice for similar problems:\n* **Maintain a broad differential diagnosis.**\n* **Use a systematic approach to analyze all available information.**\n* **Consider the relative likelihood of each diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.**\n* **Be willing to revise your initial diagnosis if new information emerges.**\n* **Continuously update your knowledge and skills in your field.**\n"
