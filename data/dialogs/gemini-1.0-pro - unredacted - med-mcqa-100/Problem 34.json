Identify the allergen responsible for the hypersensitivity reaction.\n2. Determine the type of hypersensitivity reaction based on the allergen and the clinical presentation.\n3. Consider all possible types of hypersensitivity reactions that could be triggered by the allergen.\n4. Do not rely solely on the immediate or delayed nature of the reaction to determine the type of hypersensitivity.\n5. Carefully read the question and ensure you are answering the correct aspect of the problem.\nAdvice:\n - Always consider all possible causes and mechanisms of a disease or condition.\n - Do not rely on a single piece of information to make a diagnosis.\n - Carefully read the question and ensure you are answering the correct aspect of the problem.\n - When in doubt, consult a reliable reference source or expert.\n"
