Identify the question topic and subtopic.\n2. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n3. Identify the key concepts and terms.\n4. Recall relevant knowledge and facts.\n5. Consider all possible options and exceptions.\n6. Analyze the options and eliminate those that are incorrect.\n7. Choose the answer that best fits the question and your analysis.\n8.
