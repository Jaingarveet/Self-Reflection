While BP antigen 1 & 2 are indeed involved in cicatricial pemphigoid, they are located on the dermal side of the basement membrane zone, not the epidermal side.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Specificity error:** Focusing on general aspects instead of the specific antigen targeted by IgG.\n* **Location error:** Misunderstanding the location of BP antigen 1 & 2 in the basement membrane zone.\n* **Knowledge gap:** Incomplete understanding of the antigens involved in cicatricial pemphigoid.\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the target antigen:** IgG antibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid bind to **XVII collagen**, a component of anchoring fibrils located on the epidermal side of the basement membrane zone.\n2. **Apply knowledge of salt-split skin technique:** This technique separates the epidermis from the dermis, allowing visualization of the epidermal side where XVII collagen is located.\n3. **Match the antigen with the technique:** Since the salt-split skin technique reveals the epidermal side, the antigen targeted by IgG on this side must be XVII collagen.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. **Focus on specific details:** Pay close attention to the specific antigen, location, and technique mentioned in the question.\n2. **Utilize knowledge of relevant concepts:** Recall and apply your understanding of cicatricial pemphigoid, the basement membrane zone, and the salt-split skin technique.\n3. **Eliminate answer choices based on reasoning:** Analyze each answer choice and eliminate those that do not align with the specific details of the question.\n4. **Double-check your answer:** Review your reasoning and ensure it aligns with your knowledge and the question's specifics before selecting the final answer.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* **Read the question carefully and identify key details.**\n* **Activate relevant background knowledge and concepts.**\n* **Analyze answer choices and eliminate those that don't fit.**\n* **Reason through your answer and double-check for accuracy.**\n* **Seek additional resources or consult experts if needed.**\nBy following these steps and reflecting on my mistakes, I can improve my accuracy in answering future questions related to cicatricial pemphigoid and other medical topics.\n"
