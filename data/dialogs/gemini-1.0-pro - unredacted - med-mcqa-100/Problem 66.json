While the highest shedding does occur one week before symptoms, it continues for two weeks after their onset. \n## Error Keywords:\n* Incomplete information\n* Misinterpretation of symptom timeline\n* Failure to consider full duration of shedding\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the key information:** \n    * Hepatitis A virus sheds in feces.\n    * Shedding is highest one week before symptoms appear.\n2. **Analyze the information:** \n    * The question asks for the **total duration** of shedding, not just the peak.\n3. **Apply knowledge:** \n    * Based on medical knowledge, shedding continues for two weeks after symptoms appear.\n4. **Calculate the total duration:** \n    * One week before + two weeks after = three weeks total.\n5. **Choose the answer that matches the calculated duration:** \n    * Answer D: Two weeks before the symptoms and two weeks thereafter.\n## Instructions for future problems:\n1. **Read the question carefully and identify the key information.**\n2. **Analyze the information and consider all aspects of the problem.**\n3. **Apply your medical knowledge and relevant research to reach a conclusion.**\n4. **Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.**\n5. **If unsure, consult reliable medical resources or seek expert advice.**\n## General advice for similar problems:\n* **Maintain a strong foundation in medical knowledge and keep it updated.**\n* **Develop critical thinking and analytical skills to interpret information effectively.**\n* **Practice solving problems step-by-step and explaining your reasoning.**\n* **Be aware of common pitfalls and biases in medical decision-making.**\n* **Always prioritize patient safety and well-being in your decision-making process.**\n"
