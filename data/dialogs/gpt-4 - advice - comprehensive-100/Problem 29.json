This could be true if all three French novels and two French plays are selected. This would meet all the requirements.\nB: Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays are selected. This could be true if two French novels and one Russian novel are selected. This would meet all the requirements.\nC: Exactly two French novels and the Russian play are selected. This could be true if one Russian novel and two French plays are selected. This would meet all the requirements.\nD: Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays are selected. This could be true if one Russian novel and two French plays are selected. This would meet all the requirements.\nE: Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play are selected. This could not be true because it would violate the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If two Russian novels are selected, then at least two French novels must also be selected. But if only one play is selected, then the total number of works selected would be five, which is the minimum number of works that can be selected. Therefore, it would be impossible to select any more French novels.\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
