Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.\n  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.\n  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.\n  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.\n  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Consider all possibilities before making a decision.\n- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your final answer.\n"

Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, Robert must give his report on Monday or Wednesday morning. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give her report on Monday or Tuesday, because there would not be enough slots on the following days for both Helen and Irving to give their reports. So, Nina must give her report on Wednesday. This leaves Monday morning for Robert. Therefore, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday because the slots on that day are occupied by Nina and another student who is not Helen. \nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
