Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by\nChoices:\n  A: Helen, George, and Nina\n  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen\n  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia\n  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving\n  E: Robert, George, and Helen\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and conditions carefully.\n- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.\n- Evaluate each option systematically.\n- Remember that the absence of a condition can also be a valid scenario.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n"

But Helen has already given a report on Monday.\nOption B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This is not possible because George must give a report on Tuesday, but Robert is scheduled for Tuesday in this option.\nOption C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This is possible. Nina gives a report on Monday, Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday (Helen in the morning and Irving in the afternoon), and Olivia gives a report on Wednesday morning. George can give the afternoon report on Tuesday.\nOption D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is not possible because George must give a report on Tuesday, but Robert is scheduled for Tuesday in this option.\nOption E: Robert, George, and Helen - This is not possible because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, but Robert is scheduled for Monday morning, which would require him to give an afternoon report.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
