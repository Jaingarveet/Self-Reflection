This means that the order from west to east is Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao. We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, so the order becomes Haoyun, Jiushang, Fuyi, Huyao. Finally, we know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Yinling Station, so Yinling must be the easternmost station. The order is now Haoyun, Jiushang, Fuyi, Huyao, Yinling.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI misunderstood the spatial relationships between the stations. I incorrectly placed Jiushang Station between Haoyun and Fuyi, when it should have been placed to the east of Haoyun but not necessarily immediately next to it. This led to an incorrect placement of Yinling Station as well.\nError Keywords:\n- Spatial reasoning error\n- Logical reasoning error\n- Misinterpretation of clues\nSolution:\nFrom the context, we know that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station. This means that the order from west to east is Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao. We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, so Jiushang could be placed either between Haoyun and Fuyi or to the east of Fuyi. However, since Jiushang Station is also adjacent to Yinling Station, the only possible order is Haoyun, Fuyi, Jiushang, Yinling, Huyao. Therefore, Huyao is standing on the east side.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the spatial relationships between the stations from the context.\n2. Start by placing the stations with known relationships.\n3. Consider all possible placements for stations with multiple adjacent stations.\n4. Make sure the final order respects all the given relationships.\n5. Choose the answer that matches your final order.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n- Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.\n- Remember that adjacency does not necessarily mean immediate adjacency."
