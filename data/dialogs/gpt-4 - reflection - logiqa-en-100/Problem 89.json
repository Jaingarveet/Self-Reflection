Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

(1) Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients.(2) Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.(3) If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.\nQuestion: Based on the above conditions, which of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.\n  C: J is treated by Dr.Zhang.\n  B: C is treated by Dr.Liu.\n  D: H is treated by Dr.Wang.\n\nThought: \nThere is no Doctor F or patient C in the context, so choices A and B are incorrect. \nDr. Zhang can only treat male patients, and since J is a male child, if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat an adult male. This is possible, so choice C could be true but it's not a must. \nThere is no specific information about Dr. Wang or patient H, so choice D could be true but it's not a must. \nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"

This led me to incorrectly conclude that none of the options must be true.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Logic error\n- Condition misunderstanding\nSolution:\nGiven the conditions, Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients. J is a male child, and if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat an adult male. This is possible and must be true because Dr. Zhang can treat up to two patients and both must be male. Therefore, J must be treated by Dr. Zhang.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.\n2. Identify the constraints for each doctor.\n3. Identify the gender and age of each patient.\n4. Match the patients with the doctors based on the conditions.\n5. Check each option against the conditions and the patient-doctor assignments.\n6. Choose the option that must be true based on the conditions and assignments.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and conditions carefully.\n- Understand the constraints and conditions before attempting to solve the problem.\n- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.\n- Check each option against the conditions and assignments.\n- Be aware of the difference between possibilities and requirements in logic problems."
