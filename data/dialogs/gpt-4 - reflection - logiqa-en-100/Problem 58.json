Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This casts doubt on the assertion.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the relationship between the percentage increase in housing prices and land prices. I assumed that any increase in land prices, no matter how small, would support the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. However, in choice B, the increase in residential prices is significantly larger than the increase in land prices, which casts doubt on the assertion.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Percentage comparison\n- Cause and effect relationship\nSolution:\nThe assertion is that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. \nIn choice B, residential prices in Beijing increased by 7.2% in the first quarter of 2005 compared with the same period last year, but residential land prices only rose by 0.37%. This small increase in land prices compared to the larger increase in housing prices casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the assertion or claim made in the question.\n2. Analyze each choice and determine whether it supports or contradicts the assertion.\n3. Pay attention to the percentage increase in both housing prices and land prices.\n4. If the increase in housing prices is significantly larger than the increase in land prices, this casts doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.\n5. Choose the answer that most contradicts the assertion.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and choices carefully.\n- Understand the assertion or claim made in the question.\n- Analyze the relationship between different variables in the choices.\n- Pay attention to the percentage comparison between different variables.\n- Understand the cause and effect relationship."
