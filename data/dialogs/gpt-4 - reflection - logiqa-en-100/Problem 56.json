Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

If 99% of international ships are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge and there are rarely large external ships berthed above Nanjing, this would raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge, as it suggests that the current bridge does not significantly hinder international shipping traffic.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"

        "content": "Explanation:\nI answered the question incorrectly because I didn't consider the possibility of ships being designed to adapt to the current height of the bridge. I focused on the current traffic of large ships, rather than considering the potential for technological solutions.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Overlooking information\n- Technological solutions\nSolution:\nThe expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow for the passage of larger ships. However, if shipbuilding technology is highly developed and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan, this would raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge. This suggests that it is possible to design ships that can navigate the river without the need for altering the bridge.\nInstructions:\n1. Understand the expert's point of view.\n2. Evaluate each option in relation to the expert's point of view.\n3. Consider the implications of each option.\n4. Look for options that challenge the necessity or validity of the expert's point of view.\n5. Consider technological advancements or solutions that could negate the need for the proposed action.\n6. Choose the answer that raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question and options carefully.\n- Consider all possible implications of each option.\n- Don't overlook the potential for technological solutions.\n- Always challenge the necessity or validity of the proposed action.\n- Consider the broader context and potential future developments."
