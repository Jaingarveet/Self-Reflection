Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

The statement that would help eliminate this inconsistency would be one that suggests other factors contributing to traffic accidents. \nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"

I thought the question was asking for a solution to reduce traffic accidents, not an explanation for the inconsistency between strict drunk driving investigations and similar accident rates.\nError Keywords:\n- Misinterpretation\n- Reading comprehension\n- Logical reasoning\nSolution:\nThe question is asking for a statement that can reconcile the inconsistency between the strict investigation of drunk driving and the similar rates of traffic accidents in cities that do and do not strictly investigate drunk driving. \nOption A: \"Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.\" This statement suggests that despite the strict investigations, drunk driving still occurs, leading to similar accident rates. This explains the inconsistency.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully to understand what it's asking.\n2. Identify the inconsistency or contradiction in the given information.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the inconsistency.\n4. Choose the answer that best explains or resolves the inconsistency.\nAdvice:\n- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking.\n- Pay attention to the specific wording of the question and answer choices.\n- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.\n- Don't rush. Take your time to understand the question and evaluate each answer choice."
