Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

For example, the microorganism might have a mechanism to reproduce under freezing conditions that we are not aware of.\nError Keywords:\n- Assumption error\n- Inference error\n- Logic error\nSolution:\nGiven the premises, it is highly likely that the microorganism will not reproduce now since the lake water has frozen and it usually breeds above freezing. However, there could be other factors not mentioned in the premises that could affect this conclusion. Therefore, while it is highly likely that the conclusion is true, it may also be false.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question and the premises carefully.\n2.
