[step] To multiply radicals using the basic method, they have to have the same index. The \" index \" is the very small number written just to the left of the uppermost line in the radical symbol.\nChoices:\n  A: [substeps] Convert the precise numbers to a series, and use a formula to calculate the space. For instance, the source code must be \" oxygen \" followed by the number given in the equation.\n  B: If there is no index number, the radical is understood to be a square root (index 2) and can be multiplied with other square roots. You can multiply radicals with different indexes, but that is a more advanced method and will be explained later.\n  C: The \" index \" is written so that it works through all columns, from the top of the first and first columns to the bottom of each column. [title] Multiply the \" index \" number from top to bottom for each column.\n  D: No matter what you use, this will be much easier to understand. [substeps] Due to the out of the blue location in which radicals have the \" hex \" sign, the only numbers drawn on a fraction of an inch in decimal places are also divisible.\n"
