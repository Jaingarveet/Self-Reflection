I chose option A, assuming that the young man would need help solving the rubix cube. However, upon reflection, I realized that the text does not suggest that the young man needs help. In fact, it states that he \"tries once more\" which implies that he is attempting to solve the cube on his own.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: tries once more and ends up having to solve the puzzle alone.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
