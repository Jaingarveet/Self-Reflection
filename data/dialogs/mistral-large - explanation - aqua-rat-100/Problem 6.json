So he completes 8/6 = 1.33 houses (rounded to two decimal places).\n\nMr. Black works for 6 days, and he can paint a house in 8 days. So he completes 6/8 = 0.75 houses.\n\nTogether, they have completed 1.33 + 0.75 = 2.08 houses.\n\nNow, let's find out how much work is left for Mr. Blue.\n\nThere are 3 houses in total, and 2.08 houses have already been painted. So Mr. Blue needs to paint 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 houses.\n\nMr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days. So it will take him 0.92 \\* 12 = 11.04 days to paint the remaining part of the houses.\n\nSince Mr. Blue cannot paint a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole day.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
