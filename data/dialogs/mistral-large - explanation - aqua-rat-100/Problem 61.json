Since he was driving at a constant speed of 90 mph on his way back to A, it took him 70/90 = 0.78 hours (approximately) to cover those 70 miles. This means that the remaining 3 - 0.78 = 2.22 hours were spent driving from A to B.\n\nAt a constant speed of 70 mph, Kevin would have covered a distance of 70 \\* 2.22 = 155.4 miles from A to B. However, since we need to choose from the given options, we must round the distance to the nearest option.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\") (The closest option to 155.4 is 180)"
