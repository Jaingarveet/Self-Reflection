        "content": "Thought:\nLet's denote the number of white sharpeners as w and the number of brown sharpeners as b.\nWe know that w + b = 18 (since Jack bought 18 sharpeners in total) and that the cost of white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of brown sharpeners.\nLet's denote the cost of brown sharpeners as x. Then the cost of white sharpeners is x + 1.\nWe also know that the total cost of all sharpeners is 100 rupees. Therefore, we can write the equation:\nx \\* b + (x + 1) \\* w = 100\nWe have two equations and three unknowns, so we need to find another equation to solve the problem.\nSince w + b = 18, we can rewrite the second equation as:\nx \\* (18 - w) + (x + 1) \\* w = 100\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n18x - xw + xw + w = 100\n18x + w = 100\nNow we have two equations with two unknowns:\nw + b = 18\n18x + w = 100\nWe can solve the first equation for w:\nw = 18 - b\nSubstituting this expression for w into the second equation, we get:\n18x + 18 - b = 100\n18x - b = 82\nNow we can solve for b:\nb = 18x - 82\nSince x is the cost of brown sharpeners, it must be a positive integer. We can try different values of x until we find an integer value for b.\nIf x = 4, then b = 18 \\* 4 - 82 = 2\nIf x = 5, then b = 18 \\* 5 - 82 = 13\nIf x = 6, then b = 18 \\* 6 - 82 = 24\nIf x = 7, then b = 18 \\* 7 - 82 = 35\nIf x = 8, then b = 18 \\* 8 - 82 = 46\nIf x = 9, then b = 18 \\* 9 - 82 = 57\nIf x = 10, then b = 18 \\* 10 - 82 = 68\nIf x = 11, then b = 18 \\* 11 - 82 = 79\nIf x = 12, then b = 18 \\* 12 - 82 = 90\nWe can see that when x = 5, b = 13, which is an integer value. Therefore, the cost of brown sharpeners is 5 rupees, and the cost of white sharpeners is 6 rupees.\nSubstituting x = 5 into the equation w = 18 - b, we get:\nw = 18 - 13 = 5\nTherefore, Jack bought 5 white sharpeners and 13 brown sharpeners.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
