The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) is 7. The sum of the ages is 250 years.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression is:\n\nS = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)\n\nwhere S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula, we get:\n\n250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)\n\nSimplifying and rearranging the equation, we get a quadratic equation in n:\n\n0.125n^2 - 1.75n + 250 = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find that n = 20.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
