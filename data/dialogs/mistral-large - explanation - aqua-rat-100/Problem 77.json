Since the sum is also divisible by 10, it must be divisible by the least common multiple of 5 and 10, which is 10. Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must end in a 0.\n\nLet's denote the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers as x. Then the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is:\nx + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20\n\nSince the sum is divisible by 10, x must be even. Therefore, the first of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be an even number plus 1, which is an odd number.\n\nLet's check the answer choices:\nA: 47 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.\nB: 91 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.\nC: 41 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.\nD: 67 - This is an odd number, but it's not an even number plus 1.\nE: 44 - This is an even number, so it can't be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.\n\nNone of the answer choices can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers. However, since I must select one of the available choices, I will eliminate the even number and choose the answer that is closest to an even number plus 1.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
