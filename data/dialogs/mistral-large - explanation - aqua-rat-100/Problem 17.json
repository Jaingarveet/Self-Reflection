        "content": "Thought:\nFirst, let's calculate the total production cost per year. The company produces 420 units per month, and each unit costs $110. So, the monthly production cost is 420 \\* $110 = $46,200. Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual production cost is $46,200 \\* 12 = $554,400.\n\nTo guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the total revenue must be $626,400 more than the production cost. So, the minimum total revenue should be $554,400 (production cost) + $626,400 (desired profit) = $1,180,800.\n\nThe company sells 420 units per month, or 420 \\* 12 = 5,040 units per year. To achieve a minimum total revenue of $1,180,800, the minimum selling price per component can be calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of units: $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.29.\n\nSince we need to choose from the given options, we'll select the closest value without going below $234.29 to ensure the desired profit is met.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
