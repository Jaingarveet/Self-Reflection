I focused too much on individual conditions without exploring the combined consequences. \n## Deductions from the Context:\n* **E cannot be used:** This is directly stated in statement (4).\n* **F cannot be used:** Since E is not used, statement (1) implies F is also not used.\n* **K cannot be used:**  With E out, statement (1)'s requirement for K is void. Additionally, statement (3) tells us that without G, K is also not needed. \n* **G and J are mutually exclusive:** Statement (2) clarifies that we can have either G or H, but not J if we choose G or H.\n## Analyzing Choices:\n* **A: Incorrect.** We already know E cannot be used.\n* **B: Incorrect.** We can only have G or H, not both, due to statement (2).\n* **C: Possible.**  Since E and G are not used, K is not needed. And if G is not used, then J is also not needed based on statement (2).\n* **D: Incorrect.** This is the same as option C, but we already established that J is not needed only when G is not used. \nTherefore, the only option that must be true is that paper J and paper K are not used.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
