I likely focused too much on the individual company's goal of making money and failed to consider the broader context of increased competition due to WTO.  The correct answer should highlight the shift in focus from simply making a profit to excelling within a more competitive landscape.\n## Analyzing Choices:\n*   **A:** This option seems plausible as it mentions the transition from enterprise competition to industry competition, aligning with the increased competition due to WTO.\n*   **B:** While being the best can lead to higher profits, it doesn't fully explain the shift in the problem.\n*   **C:** This statement focuses on profitability but doesn't address the core issue of increased competition.\n*   **D:** This option seems unrelated to the change brought about by WTO.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, option A best explains the shift in the problem as it directly addresses the increased competition resulting from WTO and the subsequent need for companies to strive for excellence. \n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
