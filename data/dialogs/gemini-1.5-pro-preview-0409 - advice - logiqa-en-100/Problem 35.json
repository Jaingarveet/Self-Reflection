I might have overlooked certain possibilities or made incorrect deductions based on the information provided.  It's crucial to carefully analyze each statement and consider all possible scenarios before reaching a conclusion.\n## Analyzing the Statements:\n1. **Li was hired by Tianshu:** This is a definite fact and places Li in Tianshu.\n2. **Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit:** This means Zhao cannot be in Tianshu.\n3. **Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit:** This places Zhao and Liu together, but we don't know which unit yet.\n4. **If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan:** This is a conditional statement. \n## Deductions and Possibilities:\n*  **Zhao and Liu cannot be in Tianshu (due to statement 2).** So, they must be either in Tianji or Tianxuan together.\n*  **If Zhang is in Tianxuan, then Wang must also be in Tianxuan.** This leaves no space for Zhao and Liu in Tianxuan in this scenario.\n*  **Therefore, if Zhang is in Tianxuan, then Zhao and Liu must be in Tianji.**\n*  **If Zhang is NOT in Tianxuan, then the statement about Wang becomes irrelevant.** In this case, Zhao and Liu could be in either Tianji or Tianxuan.\n## Evaluating Options:\n*  **A: Li and Liu were hired by the same unit:** This is impossible as Li is in Tianshu and they cannot be together. \n*  **B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji:** This is possible if Zhang is NOT in Tianxuan.\n*  **C: Only Liu was hired by Tian Xuan:** This is impossible as Zhao and Liu are together.\n*  **D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan:** This is only possible if Zhang is also in Tianxuan, but then Zhao and Liu would have to be in Tianji.\n## Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the only option that could be correct is **B: Wang, Zhao and Liu were all hired by Tianji.**\n**Action: Answer(\"B\")** \n"
