I focused too much on the direct connections between locations and failed to consider the combined effect of multiple conditions. \n**Specifically, I overlooked the crucial link between condition (4) and the others.**  I should have realized that not going to I Peak would automatically eliminate the possibility of visiting Lake J due to condition (4). This, in turn, would trigger a chain reaction impacting the other choices.\n## Applying the Learnings:\nGiven that the team cannot go to I Peak, we know they **cannot visit Lake J** due to condition (4). This immediately eliminates options A and D.\nNow, considering condition (1), which states that at least one of Lake G or Lake J must be visited, and knowing Lake J is out of the question, **the team must visit Lake G.** This eliminates option B.\nTherefore, the only remaining option that satisfies all conditions is **C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain**. \n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
