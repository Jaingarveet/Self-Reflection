I might have also overlooked a crucial detail or made an incorrect assumption about the order. \n## Solving the Problem Step-by-Step:\n1. **Clue (2):** Finance is above Planning. So, the order is Planning then Finance. This eliminates options C and D.\n2. **Clue (3):** Administration is above Planning but below Human Resources. This confirms option A as a possibility and eliminates option B.\n3. **Clue (1):** Human Resources and Sales are not adjacent. Option A satisfies this condition.\nTherefore, the correct order is: Planning, Finance, Administration, Human Resources, R&D, Sales.\n**Action: Answer(\"A\")** \n"
