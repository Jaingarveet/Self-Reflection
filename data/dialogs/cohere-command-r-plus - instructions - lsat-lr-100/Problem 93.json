So no one who knows him will be surprised that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices.\nQuestion: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical.\n  B: Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before.\n  C: Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation.\n  D: Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing.\n  E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conclusion drawn in the argument: Ellsworth's indignation at media accusations. \n2. Recognize the premise: Ellsworth's self-righteous nature. \n3. Understand the relationship between self-righteousness and sensitivity to criticism. \n4. Evaluate each answer choice: \n   - \"[REDACTED]\" is incorrect because it suggests a suspicion of underlying unethical behavior, which is not relevant to Ellsworth's reaction. \n   - \"[REDACTED]\" is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion. \n   - \"[REDACTED]\" is incorrect because it focuses on hiding rather than offense. \n   - \"[REDACTED]\" is irrelevant to the argument's conclusion, which is based on expectations of self-righteous people's behavior. \n   - \"[REDACTED]\" correctly reflects the assumption that self-righteous people are expected to be easily offended, aligning with Ellsworth's reaction.\n"
