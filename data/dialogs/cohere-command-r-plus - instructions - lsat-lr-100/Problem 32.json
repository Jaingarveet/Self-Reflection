On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent.\nQuestion: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following?\nChoices:\n  A: It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education.\n  B: A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run.\n  C: Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it.\n  D: A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.\n  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the central claim or argument presented in the editorial. \n2. Recognize the apparent inconsistency highlighted by the editorial regarding the political party's stance on education spending. \n3. Understand that the question seeks to identify the assumption underlying the editorial's argument. \n4. Analyze each answer choice critically: \n   - Choice 'A' misrepresents the editorial's focus by emphasizing the actions of a legislator rather than the party's overall stance. \n   - Choice 'B' introduces a red herring by bringing up long-term spending reduction, which is unrelated to the editorial's argument. \n   - Choice 'C' shifts the discussion to moral goals and actions, which is irrelevant to the specific issue of policy consistency. \n   - Choice 'D' accurately reflects the editorial's assumption that a consistent policy does not require acting on every stated goal. \n   - Choice 'E' contradicts the editorial's observation of inconsistent views within the political party. \n\n5. Select choice 'D' as the correct answer.\n"
