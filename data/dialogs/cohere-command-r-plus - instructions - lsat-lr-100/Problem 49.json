Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them.\n  B: Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits.\n  C: The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit.\n  D: People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.\n  E: A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument's conclusion: Exaggerated warnings from doctors can help smokers quit.\n2. Determine the supporting evidence: Similar strategies involving deception can break habits.\n3. Recognize the gap: Individuals cannot easily employ such strategies themselves.\n4. Analyze the role of the third party: They provide external deception, filling the gap.\n5. Understand the key assumption: People generally cannot deceive themselves to break habits.\n6. Evaluate each choice: Only Choice [REDACTED] aligns with the identified assumption.\n"

The supporting evidence is that similar strategies, which involve deception, can be used to break habits. The gap in the argument is that individuals cannot easily adopt such deceptive strategies themselves. The role of the third party (the doctor) is to provide external deception, filling this gap.\n\nTherefore, the key assumption is that people generally find it difficult to deceive themselves successfully enough to break habits. Out of the choices provided, only option D aligns with this assumption.\n\nChoice A is unrelated to the argument's focus on self-deception and instead discusses patients' trust in doctors. Choice B is a statement about the techniques, whereas the argument focuses on the role of the third party in providing deceptive warnings. Choice C is not an assumption but a potential effect, and it does not address the role of self-deception. Choice E is a value judgment on the doctor's actions, which is beyond the scope of the argument.\n\nThus, the correct answer is choice D.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
