This is a reversal of the given statements and cannot be definitively concluded from them.\n\nChoice B: This statement adds information about the number of Canadian films produced, which is not addressed in the given statements. Therefore, this conclusion cannot be made.\n\nChoice C: This is the most suitable answer. It directly relates to the given information and does not add any assumptions or extra information. It is a simple reflection of the relationship between the films shown at both types of festivals.\n\nChoice D: This statement introduces a negative claim that cannot be proven or disproven from the given statements. The information provided only discusses films that won prizes, not all films shown at the festivals.\n\nChoice E: This statement contradicts the given information. It claims that there was at least one film that won at an international festival but was not shown at Lac Nichoutec, which cannot be true if \"most\" of the prize-winning films at Lac Nichoutec also won at international festivals.\n\nReflection: My previous incorrect answer choice, A, was too narrow in its interpretation of the given statements. I did not fully consider the implications of the word \"most.\" Choice C is the correct answer as it is the only statement that logically follows from the given information without introducing new assumptions or contradicting the original statements.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
