I focused on the fact that heavily congested highways have lower speeds, but I did not consider the relevance of speed to accident severity, which is the key connection. The correct answer, Choice D, is the best explanation because it directly addresses the relationship between speed and accident severity. My mistake was choosing an answer that wasn't relevant to the question. To improve, I should focus on the core relationship presented in the question and choose an answer that directly addresses it."
