Although new recycling projects could greatly reduce this amount, these projects would actually be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims about new recycling projects?\nChoices:\n  A: The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials.\n  B: The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.\n  C: The mayor's city has nearly exhausted its landfill space and therefore must incinerate much of its garbage.\n  D: More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes.\n  E: People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need than do people who do not recycle.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify and understand the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims. \n2. Consider the context of project counterproductivity and how it relates to environmental damage. \n3. Evaluate each answer choice based on its ability to resolve the inconsistency within the context provided. \n4. Select the answer that best addresses the contradiction while remaining consistent with the provided context.\n"
