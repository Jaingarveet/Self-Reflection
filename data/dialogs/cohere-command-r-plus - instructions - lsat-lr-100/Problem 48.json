So, if we are to maintain the quality of the education we provide, we must market our programs more aggressively. Without such marketing we will be unable to increase our enrollment.\nQuestion: The conclusion of the university president's argument can be properly drawn ifwhich one of the following is assumed?\nChoices:\n  A: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides ifit increases its enrollment.\n  B: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it increases its enrollment.\n  C: The university will increase its enrollmentifit markets its programs more aggressively.\n  D: The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.\n  E: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it markets its programs more aggressively.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the argument's conclusion and its key elements (e.g., maintaining educational quality, increasing enrollment, aggressive marketing). \n2. Understand the relationship between the argument's premises and conclusion (e.g., increasing enrollment prevents spending cuts). \n3. Recognize that the correct answer will likely address the broader context of the argument, not just a single element (e.g., Choice [REDACTED] addresses quality, spending, and their relationship). \n4. Evaluate each choice based on these criteria, selecting the assumption that best supports the argument's conclusion.\n"

It provides a direct link between aggressive marketing and increased enrollment, which is a crucial link in the argument's chain of reasoning.\n\nChoice D is incorrect because it focuses solely on the relationship between spending cuts and educational quality, ignoring the role of enrollment and marketing.\n\nChoice E is incorrect because it suggests that aggressive marketing alone will prevent spending cuts, neglecting the argument's emphasis on the need to increase enrollment.\n\nThus, Choice C is the correct assumption that supports the argument's conclusion.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
