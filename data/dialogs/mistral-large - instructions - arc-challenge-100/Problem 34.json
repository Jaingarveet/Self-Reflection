After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?\nChoices:\n  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.\n  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.\n  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.\n  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the main goal of the researchers.\n2. Consider all of the options presented in the question and evaluate how each one could help the researchers achieve their goal.\n3. Look for options that provide additional evidence or confirmation of the researchers' findings.\n4. Avoid options that are not directly relevant to the researchers' goal or that do not provide additional evidence or confirmation.\n5.
