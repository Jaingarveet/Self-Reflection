Unfortunately, without additional information, I cannot assist you in answering this question.\n\nHere are some general tips for answering this question:\n\n* Flexion and extension are types of joint movements that occur in the human body.\n* The neck is a region of the body that allows for flexion and extension movements.\n* The joints in the neck that allow for flexion and extension are the atlanto-axial joint, atlanto-occipital joint, C6-C7 joint, and C7-T1 joint.\n* Each joint has a specific function and allows for a specific range of motion.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please let me know."
