Unfortunately, without additional information, I cannot assist you in answering this question.\n\nHere are some general tips for answering this question:\n\nThe facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the face. It terminates in the anastomosis with another artery that supplies blood to the face.\n\nThe choices are:\n\nA: Opposite side of the facial artery - This choice is incorrect because the facial artery does not anastomose with itself.\n\nB: Transverse facial artery - This choice is incorrect because the transverse facial artery is a branch of the facial artery that supplies blood to the lower face.\n\nC: Anastomosis with Infra orbital artery - This choice is correct. The facial artery terminates in anastomosis with the infraorbital artery, which supplies blood to the lower eyelid, the lacrimal gland, and the nasal cavity.\n\nD: Branch of the ophthalmic artery - This choice is incorrect because the ophthalmic artery supplies blood to the eye and its surrounding tissues, but it does not anastomose with the facial artery.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
