However, I can provide you with information on Cicatricial pemphigoid.\n\nCicatricial pemphigoid, also known as bullous pemphigoid, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is caused by the deposition of autoantibodies on the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of the skin, leading to a blistering and scarring process. The autoantibodies in Cicatricial pemphigoid target the BMZ antigens, including collagen XVII, laminin 5, and epiligrin.\n\nIn the salt-split skin technique, the skin is split horizontally, and the epidermal side is tested for the presence of IgG antibodies. The choice of antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt-split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid would be:\n\nAnswer: B Epiligrin\n\nEpiligrin, also known as CD103, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed on the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis and is a target antigen of autoantibodies in Cicatricial pemphigoid. The autoantibodies against epiligrin are predominantly of the IgG class and are responsible for the blistering and scarring process in the skin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Epiligrin."
