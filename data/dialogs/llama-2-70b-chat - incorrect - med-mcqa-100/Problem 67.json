One of the major complications of this procedure is obstruction, which occurs when the connection between the cyst and the stomach becomes blocked, leading to accumulation of fluid and debris in the cyst. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and may require additional surgical intervention to resolve. Infection, fistula, and hemorrhage are also potential complications of cyst-gastrostomy, but obstruction is the most common and significant complication."
