Let's analyze the question again.\nPyloric stenosis is a condition that affects the pylorus, the region between the stomach and the small intestine. The investigation of choice would depend on the symptoms and the patient's condition.\nUSG (Ultrasound) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can visualize the pylorus and surrounding structures. It can help diagnose pyloric stenosis by measuring the pyloric canal diameter and assessing the muscle thickness. However, USG may not be able to visualize the entire pylorus and may not provide clear images in obese patients or those with gas in the stomach.\nUGI series (Upper Gastrointestinal Series) is an X-ray imaging technique that uses barium to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract. It can help diagnose pyloric stenosis by visualizing the narrowing of the pylorus and assessing the motility of the stomach and small intestine. However, UGI series may not provide detailed information about the muscle thickness and may not be able to diagnose other possible causes of vomiting.\nCT (Computed Tomography) scan is an imaging technique that uses X-rays and computer algorithms to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the body. It can help diagnose pyloric stenosis by visualizing the pylorus and surrounding structures and assessing the muscle thickness. However, CT scans may not be able to visualize the entire pylorus and may not provide clear images in obese patients or those with gas in the stomach.\nMRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is an imaging technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the body's internal structures. It can help diagnose pyloric stenosis by visualizing the pylorus and surrounding structures and assessing the muscle thickness. MRI is also useful in diagnosing other possible causes of vomiting, such as gastrointestinal motility disorders.\nConsidering the advantages and limitations of each investigation, the investigation of choice in pyloric stenosis would be MRI.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
