However, I can give you information about the parts of the uterine tube.\n\nThe uterine tube, also known as the fallopian tube, is a narrow tube that connects the ovary to the uterus. It is divided into four parts:\n\n1. Infundibulum: This is the funnel-shaped part of the uterine tube that is closest to the ovary. It has finger-like projections called fimbriae that help to pick up the egg released by the ovary during ovulation.\n2. Ampulla: This is the widest part of the uterine tube, located between the infundibulum and the isthmus. It is where fertilization typically occurs.\n3. Isthmus: This is the narrowest part of the uterine tube, connecting the ampulla to the uterus.\n4. Interstitial: This part of the uterine tube is located between the isthmus and the uterus. It is where the fertilized egg implants and travels through the uterus during pregnancy.\n\nBased on this information, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the isthmus. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Isthmus."
