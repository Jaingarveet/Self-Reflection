It can cause symptoms such as flank pain, nausea, and vomiting, but it does not have a cobra snake head appearance.\n\nC: Posterior urethral valve - A posterior urethral valve is a congenital abnormality that affects the urethra in males. It can cause urinary tract infections, urinary retention, and other symptoms, but it does not have a cobra snake head appearance.\n\nD: Bladder tumor - A bladder tumor can cause symptoms such as hematuria (blood in the urine), dysuria (painful urination), and urinary frequency.
