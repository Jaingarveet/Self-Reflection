My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the correct solution.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem:\n\nRaj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back.\nRaj is 17 years old now.\n\nSo, Rahim's age 5 years ago was 17 / 3 = 5 years ago.\n\nNow, Rahim's age is 17 + 5 = 22 years old.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D) 42 years old."
