The correct solution is:\n\nWhen 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to one-third of the original number. So, if the number is 50, then 30 subtracted is equal to 50 / 3 = 16.\n\nNow, 50% of 16 is equal to 16 x 0.5 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the value of 50% of the number after 30 is subtracted is 8.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
