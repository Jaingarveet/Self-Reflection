We can do this by using the information that 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math.\n\nLet's assume the number of students in the school is x.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 0.2x.\n\nWe also know that 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 0.28x.\n\nNow, we need to find the least possible value of x that satisfies both equations.\n\nWe can set up the equations as follows:\n\n0.2x = 100 (from the problem)\n0.28x = 140 (from the problem)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 550\n\nTherefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 550.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
