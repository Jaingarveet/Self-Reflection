If the area of each of the triangles is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the problem to identify the correct solution.\n\nTo find the perimeter of the original square cloth, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular piece that is formed by trimming the square on one edge. The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.\n\nSo, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 feet.\n\nSince the rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, the perimeter of each triangle is half of the perimeter of the rectangular piece. Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is 16/2 = 8 feet.\n\nSince the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up the following equation:\n\nPerimeter of triangle = Area of triangle\n8 feet = 70 square feet\n\nSolving for the perimeter of the original square cloth, we get:\n\nPerimeter of original square cloth = 2 x 8 feet = 16 feet\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) 58 feet."
