The correct solution is as follows:\n\nLet the age of the youngest member be x.\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250.\nSo, the age of the oldest member is 250 - x.\n\nSince the ages are in A.P., the difference between the ages of any two members is 3 months.\nSo, the age of the next member after the youngest member is x + 3 months.\n\nThe age of the oldest member is 250 - x, and the age of the next member after the oldest member is x + 3 months.\n\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can set up the equation:\nx + (x + 3 months) = 250\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2x + 3 months = 250\n\nSubtracting 3 months from both sides, we get:\n2x = 247\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\nx = 123\n\nSo, the number of members in the club is 123.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (C) 25."
