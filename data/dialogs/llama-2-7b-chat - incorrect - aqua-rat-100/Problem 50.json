Find the distance when they meet from starting point.\nChoices:\nA: 238\nB: 289\nC: 200\nD: 287\nE: 187\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. I realized my mistake and reflected on the correct solution.\n\nTo find the distance when the ship and the plane meet, we need to use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time\n\nThe ship traveled 180 miles, so its speed is 180/x, where x is the time it took the ship to travel that distance.\n\nThe plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so its initial speed is 10 x 180 = 1800 miles per hour.\n\nThe plane will meet the ship when it has traveled x hours, so the distance between them is:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time = 1800 x x\n\nTo find the value of x, we can set up the equation:\n\n1800 x x = 180\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, the distance between the ship and the plane when they meet is:\n\nDistance = 1800 x 10 = 18,000 miles\n\nThe correct answer is (B) 289.\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous incorrect answer. Thank you for the opportunity to reflect and improve my understanding of the problem."
