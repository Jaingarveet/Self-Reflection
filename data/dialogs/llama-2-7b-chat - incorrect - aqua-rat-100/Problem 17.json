Therefore, the total production cost for 12 months is:\n\n$110 x 12 = $1,320\n\nThe company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400 in a year. So, we need to find the minimum selling price per component that will give us this profit:\n\nProfit = Revenue - Production Costs\n= Sales - $1,320\n\nWe know that the company sells all the components, so the total revenue for 12 months is:\n\n$110 x 420 = $46,800\n\nNow, let's find the minimum selling price per component that will give us a profit of at least $626,400:\n\nMinimum Selling Price = Profit / Number of Components\n= $626,400 / 420\n= $1,477\n\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component is $1,477.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
