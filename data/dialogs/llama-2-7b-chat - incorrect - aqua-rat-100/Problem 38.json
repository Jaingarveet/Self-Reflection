It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm. If the outer surface of the cube is painted, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\n\nTo solve this problem, I will use the formula for the number of faces of a cube: 6 × s², where s is the length of a side of the cube.\n\nThe length of a side of the original cube is 5cm = 0.05m.\nThe length of a side of the smaller cubes is also 0.05m, since they are identical.\n\nTherefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes is:\n6 × (0.05m)^2 = 90\n\nSo, there are 90 faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
