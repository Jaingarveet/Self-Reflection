The correct ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 59:91, which is option D.\n\nHere's how I arrived at this answer:\n\nLet's use the information given in the problem:\n\n* Alloy X has a ratio of 6:9 (zinc:copper)\n* Alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11 (zinc:copper)\n* 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z\n\nTo find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to find the ratio of the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z to the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y.\n\nLet's first find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y:\n\nAlloy X: 40 grams x 6/9 = 26 grams of zinc and 40 grams x 9/6 = 66 grams of copper\nAlloy Y: 60 grams x 7/11 = 43 grams of zinc and 60 grams x 11/7 = 84 grams of copper\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z:\n\nAlloy Z: 40 grams + 60 grams = 100 grams\n\nSo, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:\n\n100 grams of alloy Z / (26 grams of zinc in alloy X + 43 grams of zinc in alloy Y) = 100 grams / (26 + 43) = 59:91\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D: 59:91."
