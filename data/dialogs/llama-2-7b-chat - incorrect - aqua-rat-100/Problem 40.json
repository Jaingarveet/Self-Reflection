How much money did John have ?\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nExplanation:\n\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. The correct answer is C: 28.\n\nHere's how I arrived at the answer:\n\nIf Mark gives John half of his money, John will have Rs.75.\n\nJohn said that if Mark gives him one third of his money, he will have Rs.75.\n\nSo, if John had Rs.75 initially, and Mark gave him one third of his money, John would have:\n\nRs.75 / 3 = Rs.25\n\nTherefore, John had Rs.28 initially."
