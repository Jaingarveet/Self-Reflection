My solution was (A) x2/y2 units. However, upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (B) y3/x2 units.\n\nTo arrive at the correct answer, I used the formula for the work done by a single person in a day:\n\nWork done = x units/day\n\nSince we are given that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, we can set up the equation:\n\nx x = x\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = x2\n\nTherefore, the work done by y men working y hours per day in y days is:\n\nWork done = y3/x2 units\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) y3/x2 units."
