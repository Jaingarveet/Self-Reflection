My solution was:\n\nA: M + N / 8\n\nHowever, upon further reflection, I realized that my answer was incorrect. The correct solution is:\n\nB: 2M + N / 8\n\nExplanation:\nThe athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, which means they covered M miles in 4/1 = 4 hours.\nThen, they ride a bike N miles in the same number of hours, which means they covered N miles in 4/2 = 2 hours.\nTo find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to add the distance covered in each activity and divide by the total time taken:\n\nM + N / 2 = (M + N) / 4\n\nTherefore, the average speed for these two activities combined is:\n\nB: 2M + N / 8\n\nAnswer: B"
