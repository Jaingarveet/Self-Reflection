What is the cost price of the article?\nChoices:\n  A: 270\n  B: 300\n  C: 280\n  D: 320\n  E: 315\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly. My solution was based on a misunderstanding of the problem. Upon reflection, I realized that the profit percentage was 20%, not 10% as I initially thought. Therefore, the cost price of the article can be calculated as follows:\n\nCost price = Selling price / (1 + Profit percentage)\n= 360 / (1 + 0.20)\n= 360 / 1.20\n= 300\n\nTherefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
