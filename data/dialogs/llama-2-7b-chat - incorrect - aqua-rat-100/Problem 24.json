The highest score is x, and the lowest score is also x. We are asked to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula for the average of a set of numbers: (x1 + x2 + ... + xn)/n. In this case, the set of numbers is {x, x, ..., x}. Since there are z > 5 students in the class, we can simplify the formula to (zx – y)/(z – 2).\n\nTherefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (zy – 2x)/z."
