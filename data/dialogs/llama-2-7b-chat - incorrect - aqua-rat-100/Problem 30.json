The doctor gave Roy 5 tablets and asked him to take one every 15 minutes. To find out how long it will take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets, we need to calculate the time it takes to take 5 tablets.\n\nTime = Number of tablets / Time between each tablet\nTime = 5 tablets / 15 minutes\nTime = 5 x 15 = 75 minutes\n\nAction: The correct answer is (B) 75 minutes.\n\nAnswer: Roy will take 75 minutes to consume all 5 tablets."
