If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper?\nChoices:\n  A: 8.75\n  B: 8.79\n  C: 8.75\n  D: 8.71\n  E: 8.72\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly, and I realized that I made a mistake in my calculation. I understand that the area of the remaining paper can be calculated by finding the area of the two semi-circles and subtracting it from the area of the original square paper.\n\nTo find the area of the semi-circles, I can use the formula: Area = πr^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. The radius of each semi-circle is half the diameter, so the radius of each semi-circle is 10 cm (since the diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm).\n\nThe area of each semi-circle is:\nArea = π(10)^2 = 80π\n\nNow, to find the area of the remaining paper, I need to subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the original square paper. The area of the original square paper is:\nArea = 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2\n\nSo, the area of the remaining paper is:\nArea = 400 cm^2 - 80π = [REDACTED]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is [E: 8.72]."
