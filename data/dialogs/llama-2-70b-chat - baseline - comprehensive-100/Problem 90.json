Option A provides a logical continuation of the instructions, emphasizing the importance of removing the screen from the window before cleaning it. It also provides additional information on how to remove the screen, depending on the type of window screen one has.\n\nOption B does not relate to removing the screen from the window but instead suggests a method for cleaning the screen. Option C mentions a different type of window screen and how to remove its cover, but it does not relate to the overall instruction of removing the screen from the window. Option D is unrelated to the topic of cleaning window screens and seems out of place. Therefore, the best answer is Option A."
