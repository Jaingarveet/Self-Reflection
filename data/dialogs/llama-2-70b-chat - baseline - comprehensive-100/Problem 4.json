It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its horizontal speed is 700/5 = 140 m/s.\n3. The length of the space shuttle (L) can be found using the formula L = vht, where vh is the horizontal speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds in this case).\n4. Substituting the values, we get L = 140 m/s x 5 s = 700 m.\n\nTherefore, the length of the space shuttle is 700 m, which corresponds to choice E: 150 m.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
