        "content": "  Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.\nSince there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.\n\nEach daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.\n\nThere are 4 daughters, so the total amount they receive is 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 16x rupees.\n\nSince there are 5 sons, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.\n\nThe total amount the sons receive is 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x rupees.\n\nThe total amount available to divide is Rs 8600, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n16x + 25x = 8600\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n41x = 8600\n\nDividing both sides by 41, we get:\n\nx = 210\n\nSo, each daughter receives 4x = 4(210) = 840 rupees.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n\nB: Rs 500\n\nTherefore, the answer is B."
