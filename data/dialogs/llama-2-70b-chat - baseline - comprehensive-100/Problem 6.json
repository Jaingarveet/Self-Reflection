The length of line segment ST is 22. Therefore, the distance between S and T is 22/2 = 11.\n3. Since R is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance between R and S is equal to the distance between R and T.\n4. The distance between R and S is 5, and the distance between R and T is 17 - 5 = 12.\n5. The length of line segment RU is half the distance between R and U. Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the distance between R and U is half the distance between R and T.\n6. Therefore, the length of line segment RU is half of 12 = 6.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
