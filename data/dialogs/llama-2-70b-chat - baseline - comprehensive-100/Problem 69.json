Substituting this into the second equation, we get:\n\n$$3(-3y - 14) - 2y = -6$$\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n$$-9y - 42 = -6$$\nAdding 9y to both sides, we get:\n\n$$-42 = -6$$\nTherefore, the value of $x - y$ is not defined, since we have a contradiction.\nAction: Answer(\"None of the Above\")"
