I thought that a frenemy was simply someone who was not a close friend, but I have since learned that a frenemy is someone who is both a friend and an enemy. This means that they are someone who you can trust to some extent, but who also has the potential to hurt you.\nIn light of this new understanding, I believe that the most likely completion to the text is Choice D: Play it safe by ending the relationship gently. This is because it is the safest option for the person who is dealing with the frenemy. By ending the relationship, they are removing themselves from the potential for further hurt.\nI am confident that this is the correct answer because it is the most cautious and safest option for the person who is dealing with the frenemy. It is important to remember that frenemies can be very damaging to our emotional well-being, and it is important to protect ourselves from them.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
