I used the wrong formula, which resulted in an incorrect answer. After reflecting on the problem, I realized my mistake and used the correct formula to find the cost price. I also double-checked my calculations to ensure that I had the correct answer. In the future, I will be more careful in using the correct formula and double-checking my calculations to avoid similar mistakes."
