Since a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(length + width).\nIn this case, the length is 8 cm and the width is 3 cm.\nSo, the perimeter is 2*(8 + 3) = 2*11 = 22 cm.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nSelf-reflection:\nI previously made a calculation error by multiplying the length and width instead of adding them and then multiplying by 2.
