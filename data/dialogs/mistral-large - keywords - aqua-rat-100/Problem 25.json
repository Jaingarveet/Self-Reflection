To find the time it takes to travel the remaining distance \"x - d\", we can set up a proportion:\n(10 minutes) / d = t / (x - d)\n\nSubstituting the expression for \"d\" and solving for \"t\", we get:\nt = (x - d) * 10 / d\nt = (x - (√3 - 1)x/√3) * 10 / ((√3 - 1)x/√3)\nt = (x/√3) * 10 / ((√3 - 1)x/√3)\nt = 10 / (√3 - 1)\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
