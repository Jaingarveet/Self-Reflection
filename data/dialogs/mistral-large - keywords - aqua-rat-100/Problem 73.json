The problem states that 20% of the students took physics and 28% took math, and we need to find the least possible number of students in the school. To find this, we need to find the LCM of 20 and 28, but we also need to consider that there are more than 501 students in the school.\n\nThought:\nThe LCM of 20 and 28 is 140. However, since there are more than 501 students in the school, we need to find the smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501.\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\nExplanation:\nThe smallest multiple of 140 that is greater than 501 is 700. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 700."
