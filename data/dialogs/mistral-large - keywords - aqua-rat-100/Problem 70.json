I incorrectly calculated the probability as 0.6 by dividing the time he waits for the first train (2 minutes) by the frequency of both trains (10 minutes). However, the correct calculation is to divide the time he waits for the first train by the total time he waits for both trains.\nI also made a probability error by not considering the fact that the man will have to wait for either 2 minutes or 8 minutes for the next train. The probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time he waits for the first train to the total time he waits for both trains.\nFinally, I made a ratio error by not correctly calculating the ratio of the time he waits for the first train to the total time he waits for both trains. The correct ratio is 2/10 = 0.2, not 2/10 = 0.6.\nTo avoid these errors in the future, I will carefully consider the problem and make sure to correctly calculate the probability and ratio. I will also double-check my calculations to ensure they are correct."
