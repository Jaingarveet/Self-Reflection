Therefore, we have the equation:\nb \\* (4b + 1) = 150\nExpanding the equation, we get:\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\nSolving this quadratic equation, we find that b = 5.\nTherefore, the length of the rectangle is 4 \\* 5 + 1 = 21.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is given by 2 \\* (length + breadth) = 2 \\* (21 + 5) = 62.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nSelf-reflection:\nPreviously, I made an error in solving the quadratic equation. I incorrectly calculated the discriminant, which led to an incorrect solution. After reviewing the problem and my solution, I realized my mistake and corrected it. In the future, I will be more careful when solving quadratic equations and double-check my calculations to avoid similar errors."
