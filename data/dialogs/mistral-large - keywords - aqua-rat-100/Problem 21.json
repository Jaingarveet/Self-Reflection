I incorrectly assumed that the work done was directly proportional to the number of men and the number of hours worked per day. However, the work done is also inversely proportional to the number of days taken to complete the work.\n\nThought:\nLet's denote the work done by x men working x hours per day in x days as W.\nThen, W is proportional to the number of men, the number of hours worked per day, and inversely proportional to the number of days taken to complete the work.\nMathematically, we can write this as:\nW = k * (x men) * (x hours/day) * (1/x days)\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo find the work done by y men working y hours per day in y days, we can substitute y for x in the above equation:\nW' = k * (y men) * (y hours/day) * (1/y days)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\nW' = k * y^2 * (1/y) = k * y\n\nSince W and W' are both equal to k times their respective work units, we can set them equal to each other and solve for W':\nW' = W * (y/x)\n\nSubstituting W = x^3 units (since x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days), we get:\nW' = x^3 * (y/x) = x^2 * y\n\nTherefore, the work done by y men working y hours per day in y days is x^2 * y units.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
