I incorrectly calculated the sum of the ages as 250 years instead of 250 months.\n\nThought:\nThe youngest member is 7 years old, which is equivalent to 84 months.\nThe ages of the members form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months.\nLet n be the number of members in the club.\nThe sum of the ages of all the members is given as 250 months.\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression is:\nSn = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)\nwhere a is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms.\nSubstituting the given values, we get:\n250 = n/2 * (2*84 + (n-1)*3)\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n250 = n/2 * (168 + 3n - 3)\n250 = n/2 * (165 + 3n)\n500 = n * (165 + 3n)\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n166.67 â‰ˆ n * (55 + n)\nSince n must be an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer and check if it satisfies the equation:\n167 = n * (55 + n)\nFactoring, we get:\n(n - 25)(n + 7) = 0\nThe possible values for n are 25 and -7.\nSince the number of members cannot be negative, we choose n = 25.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
