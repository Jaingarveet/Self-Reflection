I misunderstood that if the GCF of two numbers is 11, then 11 must be a factor of both numbers. However, this is not necessarily true. The GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder, but it does not have to be a factor of both numbers themselves.\n\nI also misunderstood the problem by misinterpreting the given information. The problem states that the GCF of two positive integers is 11, not that 11 is a factor of both integers. Additionally, the problem states that the LCM of these two integers is 7700, not that 7700 is a multiple of both integers.\n\nTo solve this problem correctly, I need to use the relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers, which is:\n\nGCF \\* LCM = product of the two numbers\n\nSince I know that one of the integers is 350 and the GCF is 11, I can write the equation as:\n\n11 \\* 7700 = 350 \\* x\n\nSolving for x, I get:\n\nx = 242\n\nTherefore, the other integer is 242.\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
