So, the profit made on each bag is $25.\nThe total profit made is $3,000.\nTo find the number of bags sold, we need to divide the total profit by the profit made on each bag.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\nReflection:\nPreviously, I made a calculation error when dividing the total profit by the profit made on each bag. I incorrectly divided $3,000 by $100 instead of $25.\nThe correct calculation is $3,000 / $25 = 120 bags.\nHowever, none of the available choices match this answer.\nUpon further reflection, I realized that I made an arithmetic error when calculating the profit made on each bag. I incorrectly calculated 25% of $100 as $250 instead of $25.\nThe correct calculation is $100 x 0.25 = $25.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120 bags / 5 = 24 bags.\nThe error keywords that led to this reflection are \"calculation error,\" \"arithmetic error,\" and \"multiplication error.\""
