For this to be a meaningful statement, we must assume that the current situation is different - i.e., that currently most employees do not have a commute over 30 minutes.\n3. Looking at the answer choices:\nA) This is too strong. The argument doesn't require that all employees currently have a short commute, just most. \nB) The chairperson's reasons are not relevant to the logic of the argument.\nC) The argument doesn't say anything about whether employees favor the move or not.\nD) This matches our reasoning in step 2. For the move to meaningfully change commute times, most employees must currently have a shorter commute.\nE) The argument doesn't rely on any assumptions about pay raises.\nTherefore, the argument requires assuming choice D - that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
