        "content": "Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:\n1. We know there are 8 books total (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves. \n2. At least 2 books must be on each shelf. Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top, the distribution must be:\n   - Top shelf: 2 books\n   - Middle shelf: 2 or 3 books  \n   - Bottom shelf: 3 or 4 books\n3. The question states that G is on the top shelf. So there is 1 unknown book on the top shelf with G.\n4. I must be on the middle shelf per the conditions. So the middle shelf contains I and 1-2 other books.\n5. K must be on a higher shelf than F. Since F is on the same shelf as M, K must be above both F and M. \n   - If F and M are on the bottom, K could be on the top or middle.\n   - If F and M are on the middle, K must be on the top.\n6. O must be on a higher shelf than L. So if L is on the bottom, O is on the middle or top. If L is on the middle, O is on the top.\n7. Looking at the answer choices, only B and D have I on the middle shelf as required. \n8. For B to work, L would need to be on the middle. But then O would have to be on the top shelf with G and K. That's 3 books on the top, violating the \"more on bottom than top\" rule. So B doesn't work.\n9. For D to work, L and K would both be on the middle with I. O could then be on the top with G, and F, H and M on the bottom. This satisfies all conditions.\nTherefore, the only listed arrangement that could work is D: I, K, L on the middle shelf.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
