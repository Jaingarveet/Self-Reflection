The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is the \"string sign,\" which is the appearance of a thickened muscular layer of the pylorus. This can be seen on an upper GI series or a barium swallow study. The \"string sign\" is caused by the barium contrasting the narrowed channel. Another common X-ray finding in pyloric stenosis is a \"single bubble appearance,\" where there is gas in the stomach but not in the distal bowel.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA: Single bubble appearance\n\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
