Although vivax malaria does target RBCs, it has a preference for immature RBCs, or reticulocytes, which is an important distinction. Falciparum malaria, on the other hand, has a broad tropism and can infect RBCs at various stages, including mature RBCs. To avoid similar errors, I will review the characteristics of common malaria parasites and pay attention to their unique behaviors and preferences. Additionally, staying current with the latest research in microbiology is crucial due to ongoing discoveries and updates in this field.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
