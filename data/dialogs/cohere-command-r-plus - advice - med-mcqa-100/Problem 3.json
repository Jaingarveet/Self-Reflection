Condensation silicone, while elastic, sets by a condensation reaction and is typically catalyzed by tin or zinc. Polyether is elastic and sets by a chemical reaction, but it is often self-cured or activated by other means, not specifically chloroplatinic acid. Polysulfides are elastic and chemically cured, and they can be catalyzed by various agents, including amines and sometimes chloroplatinic acid. Polyvinyl siloxane is elastic, chemically cured, and can be catalyzed by different agents, with some formulations utilizing chloroplatinic acid. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].\n\nAction: Answer(\"[REDACTED]\")"
