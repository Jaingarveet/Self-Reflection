While both are important components, only collagen XVII is recognized as the primary autoantigen in cicatricial pemphigoid via the salt-split skin technique, as it is specifically located on the epidermal side.\n\nThought: In light of the reflection, collagen XVII (also known as BP180) is the correct antigen recognized in cicatricial pemphigoid via the salt-split skin technique. This technique involves splitting the skin at the dermal-epidermal junction, and collagen XVII is found on the epidermal side, making it the target of autoantibodies in this disease.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
