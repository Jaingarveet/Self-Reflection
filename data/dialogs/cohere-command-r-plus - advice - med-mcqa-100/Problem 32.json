This pattern is characteristic of a specific type of granulomatous disease.\n\nDifferential diagnosis:\n- Rhinoscleroma: A chronic bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis, leading to rhinophyma (\"pug nose\"). Typically affects children and young adults in endemic areas, and is more common in developing countries.\n- Wegener's granulomatosis: A rare autoimmune disease that affects small- and medium-sized blood vessels. It involves granulomatous inflammation and necrosis, typically affecting the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. However, it usually presents with more widespread symptoms, including fever, weight loss, and renal involvement.\n- Midline lethal granuloma (MLG): A rare and aggressive form of granulomatous inflammation that typically affects the nose and paranasal sinuses. It often presents with nasal obstruction, discharge, and epistaxis. The biopsy image is highly suggestive of MLG due to its characteristic necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. MLG mainly affects adults, and its prognosis is poor despite treatment.\n- Rhinosporidiosis: A chronic infectious disease caused by the parasite Rhinosporidium seeberi. It typically affects the nasal mucosa and presents with polypoid masses and nasal discharge. It is endemic in certain parts of the world, particularly India, South America, and sub-Saharan Africa, and is usually transmitted through contaminated water.\n\nGiven the patient's age, gender, and biopsy findings, the correct diagnosis is C: Midline lethal granuloma (also known as Stewa's granuloma).\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
