I didn't consider that each acid has unique properties and indications.\n\nThought: \nChemical peels are used to improve the appearance of the skin, commonly on the face, hands, and neck. Different types of acids are used as exfoliating agents, including alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), and phenol. \n\nGlycolic acid and lactic acid are common AHAs, while salicylic acid is a BHA. These acids have different molecular weights and penetration abilities, affecting the depth of the peel and the type of skin concerns they address. Kojic acid is also used in chemical peels and is known for its ability to improve pigmentation concerns. \n\nPhenol is a stronger agent used for deep chemical peels, treating more severe skin concerns. While glycolic acid, kojic acid, and salicylic acid are commonly used for mild to moderate peels, phenol is reserved for more intensive treatments due to its ability to penetrate deeper layers of the skin. \n\nTherefore, of the choices provided, phenol is not typically used in milder chemical peels compared to the other options.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
