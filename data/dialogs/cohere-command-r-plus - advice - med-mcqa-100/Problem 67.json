Obstruction is not a common complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cysts, and is more of a complication associated with other procedures. Fistula formation is a known and significant risk due to the proximity of the stomach and pancreas, and the potential for an abnormal connection to form during the procedure. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Fistula.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
