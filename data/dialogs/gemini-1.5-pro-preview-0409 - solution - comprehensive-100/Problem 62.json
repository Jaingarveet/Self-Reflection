We multiplied the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:\n$$\\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\\\ 6 y-3 x=-57\\end{array}$$\n2. We added the two equations together: \n$$10y = -80$$\n3. We solved for y:\n$$y = -8$$\n4. Now, substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:\n$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$\n5. Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:\n$$3x - 32 = -23$$\n$$3x = 9$$\n$$x = 3$$\nTherefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).\n"
