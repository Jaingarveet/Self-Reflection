At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: H, I\n  B: I, L\n  C: H, I, L\n  D: I, K, L\n  E: F, I, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nSolution:\n"

It's crucial to consider all given conditions and their implications on each shelf to arrive at the correct answer.\n## Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **G on Top Shelf:** This leaves 7 books for the middle and bottom shelves.\n2. **Bottom Shelf > Top Shelf:** Since G is alone on the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\n3. **I on Middle Shelf:** This is a fixed condition.\n4. **K above F:** This means K cannot be on the bottom shelf.\n5. **O above L:** This means L cannot be on the top shelf (already occupied by G).\n6. **F with M:** These two books must be together on the same shelf.\n## Deductions:\n*  Since K cannot be on the bottom and G is on top, **K must be on the middle shelf** with I.\n*  Since L cannot be on top and the bottom shelf needs at least 3 books, **L must be on the middle shelf** with I and K.\n*  This leaves F and M for the bottom shelf, along with one more book (H or O).\nTherefore, the middle shelf must contain I, K, and L. \n**Action: Answer(\"D\")** \n"
