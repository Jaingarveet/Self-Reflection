I should have paid closer attention to the rule about reaching Lake J, which requires crossing I Peak.\n## Reasoning for Current Attempt:\nSince the team cannot go to I Peak, they **cannot visit Lake J** due to rule (4). This immediately eliminates options A and D. \nNext, we need to consider the implications of not visiting Lake J on the remaining options. \n*   **Option B:** This option talks about visiting city E but doesn't provide information about visiting either Lake G or H Mountain, which are necessary to fulfill condition (1). \n*   **Option C:** This option suggests visiting both Lake G and H Mountain, which satisfies condition (1). However, to visit H Mountain, the team must also visit city E according to rule (3). This doesn't contradict any given information.\nTherefore, the only option that must be true is visiting Lake G and H Mountain.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \n"
