Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.

This oversight probably led me to a solution that violated this condition. \n## Answering the Question:\n**Analysis of Choices:**\n* **A: Helen, George, Nina:** This option violates the condition that if Nina presents, Helen and Irving must present the next day. \n* **B: Irving, Robert, and Helen:** This option violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report, as he would have to present in the afternoon on Tuesday due to George's Tuesday presentation.\n* **C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia:** This option is valid as Nina presents on Monday, followed by Helen and Irving on Tuesday (fulfilling the condition), and Olivia can present on Wednesday morning.\n* **D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving:** This option violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.\n* **E: Robert, George, and Helen:** This option violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, only option C fulfills all the given conditions.\n**Action: Answer(\"C\")** \n"
