        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider the impact of the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This rule limits the assignment of a parking space for Young to only two possible spaces, #5 and #6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) four.\n\nError Keywords:\n\n* Oversight\n* Misinterpretation of rules\n* Insufficient consideration of constraints\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.\n2. Consider the impact of each rule on the assignment of parking spaces for each employee.\n3. Determine which employees have limited options for parking space assignment due to the rules.\n4. Count the number of employees with limited options.\n5. Answer the question based on the count.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.\n2. Create a list of the rules and their impact on each employee's parking space assignment.\n3. Evaluate each employee's options based on the rules and identify those with limited options.\n4. Count the number of employees with limited options.\n5. Choose the answer that matches the count.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Identify all the relevant information and rules that govern the problem.\n* Consider the impact of each rule on the assignment of parking spaces for each employee.\n* Evaluate each employee's options based on the rules and identify those with limited options.\n* Double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the rules may have a domino effect, and one rule can impact another employee's options.\n"

        "content": "  Action: Answer(\"C\")\n\nThe correct answer is C: three.\n\nExplanation:\nThe rules governing the assignment of parking spaces are:\n1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.\n2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.\n3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.\n4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nBased on the rules, we can conclude that:\n\n* Young's options are limited to #5 and #6.\n* Xu's options are limited to #3, #4, #5, and #6.\n* Souza's options are limited to #2, #3, #4, and #5.\n* Togowa's options are limited to #1, #2, #3, and #4.\n* Vaughn's options are not limited.\n\nTherefore, three employees have limited options for parking space assignment: Young, Xu, and Souza. The correct answer is (C) three.\n\nReflection:\nMy previous answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the impact of the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This rule limits the assignment of a parking space for Young to only two possible spaces, #5 and #6. I should have carefully evaluated each employee's options based on the rules and identified those with limited options. I will make sure to double-check my calculations and final answer in the future."
