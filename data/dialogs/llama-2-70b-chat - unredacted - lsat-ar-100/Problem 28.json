I learned the importance of carefully reading and understanding the conditions of the problem, paying attention to the wording of the conditions, and using a systematic approach to deduce the solution. I also learned the value of double-checking my answer to ensure it satisfies all the conditions. These skills are essential in law and other fields that require critical thinking and problem-solving abilities."
