At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?\nChoices:\n  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my reasoning.\nI incorrectly deduced that the top shelf had 2 books, the middle shelf had 3 books, and the bottom shelf had 3 books.\nI also incorrectly deduced that K had to be on the top shelf and F had to be on the middle or bottom shelf.\nI further incorrectly deduced that O had to be on the top or middle shelf and L had to be on the bottom shelf.\nI also incorrectly deduced that F and M had to be on the middle or bottom shelf together.\n\nError Keywords:\n- Incorrect deductions\n- Misunderstanding of the conditions\n- Inconsistent reasoning\n\nSolution:\nWe are given that:\n\n* More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf\n* I is on the middle shelf\n* K is on a higher shelf than F\n* O is on a higher shelf than L\n* F is on the same shelf as M\n\nWe can start by placing I on the middle shelf.\nWe know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K goes on the top shelf and F goes on the middle shelf.\nWe know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O goes on the top shelf and L goes on the bottom shelf.\nWe know that F is on the same shelf as M, so F and M go on the middle shelf together.\n\nNow, let's place the remaining books:\n\n* H goes on the bottom shelf with L.\n* G goes on the top shelf with K.\n\nNow, all the books are placed on the shelves:\n\nTop shelf: K, G\nMiddle shelf: I, F, M\nBottom shelf: L, H, O\n\nInstructions:\n1. Place I on the middle shelf.\n2. Place K on the top shelf and F on the middle shelf.\n3. Place O on the top shelf and L on the bottom shelf.\n4. Place F and M on the middle shelf together.\n5. Place H and L on the bottom shelf together.\n6. Place G on the top shelf with K.\n7. Place O on the top shelf with K.\n8. Check that all the conditions are met.\n\nAdvice:\n\n* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n* Remember that the given conditions may not be exhaustive, so be careful when making deductions.\n* In a question with multiple choices, carefully evaluate each choice and eliminate those that are inconsistent with the given conditions.\n"
