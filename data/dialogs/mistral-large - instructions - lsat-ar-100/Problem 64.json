Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim works in Zone 2.\n  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.\n  C: Parra works in Zone 3.\n  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.\n  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the sales representatives who work in the same sales zone as each other.\n2. Identify the sales representatives who cannot work in the same sales zone as each other.\n3. Identify the minimum and maximum number of sales representatives who can work in each sales zone.\n4. Consider all possible distributions of sales representatives in the sales zones.\n5. Eliminate the distributions that violate the given conditions.\n6. Choose the answer that corresponds to a possible distribution.\n"

Sales representatives who work in the same sales zone as each other:\n   - Parra and Quinn\n   - Stuckey and Udall\n   - Mahr and Stuckey (given in the question)\n2. Sales representatives who cannot work in the same sales zone as each other:\n   - Parra and Tiao (cannot both work in Zone 1)\n   - Tiao and Udall (cannot both work in Zone 2)\n3. Minimum and maximum number of sales representatives who can work in each sales zone:\n   - Zone 1: Min 1, Max 3\n   - Zone 2: Min 1, Max 3\n   - Zone 3: Min 3, Max 5 (since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)\n4. Considering all possible distributions of sales representatives in the sales zones:\n   - Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey works with Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must be in the same sales zone.\n   - This means that Zone 3 must have at least Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall. To satisfy the condition that Zone 3 has more sales representatives than Zone 2, Zone 3 must also have Parra and Quinn (since they work together).\n   - This leaves only Zone 1 for Kim and either Tiao or Parra (but not both).\n5. Eliminate the distributions that violate the given conditions:\n   - Since Parra cannot work in Zone 3 (because Parra and Quinn would have to be in Zone 3, but there is no room left), Parra must work in Zone 1.\n   - This means Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 (since Parra is already there), so Tiao must work in Zone 2.\n6. Choose the answer that corresponds to a possible distribution:\n   - A: Kim works in Zone 2. (This is possible, since Kim can work in any zone.)\n   - B: Mahr works in Zone 1. (This is not possible, since Mahr works with Stuckey and Udall, who are in Zone 3.)\n   - C: Parra works in Zone 3. (This is not possible, since Parra must work in Zone 1.)\n   - D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
