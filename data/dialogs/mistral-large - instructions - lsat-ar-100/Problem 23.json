Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\nQuestion: If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, which one of the following could be the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: Irving, Lenore, and Nina\n  B: Lenore, George, and Irving\n  C: Nina, Irving, and Lenore\n  D: Robert, George, and Irving\n  E: Robert, Irving, and Lenore\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions of the problem.\n2. Identify the given information about the reports.\n3. Use logical reasoning to determine the possible lists of students who give the morning reports.\n4. Consider all possible scenarios and conditions.\n5. Double-check your reasoning and assumptions.\n6. Choose the answer that matches your determined list.\n"

However, after reflecting on the problem and the conditions, I realized that Nina cannot give a report at all, because if she did, Helen and Irving would have to give reports on the next day, but they are already giving reports on Wednesday. Therefore, I corrected my mistake and chose the right answer."
