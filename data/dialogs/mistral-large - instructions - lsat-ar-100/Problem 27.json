The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?\nChoices:\n  A: Jiang, Kramer\n  B: Kramer, O'Neill\n  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill\n  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill\n  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Identify the given conditions and interpret them correctly.\n3. List the possible options for the students who review Tamerlane.\n4. Evaluate each option against the given conditions.\n5. Eliminate the options that do not satisfy all conditions.\n6. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.\n"

Therefore, they must each review exactly two plays.\n* Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two students must review the same play(s) as each other, O'Neill cannot review any other play besides Tamerlane.\n\nTherefore, the possible options for the students who review Tamerlane are:\n\n* Kramer and O'Neill (since they both review Tamerlane)\n* Kramer and Lopez (since they both review exactly two plays, and one of them must be Tamerlane)\n\nEvaluating each option against the given conditions:\n\n* Option A (Jiang, Kramer) is incorrect because Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.\n* Option B (Kramer, O'Neill) satisfies all conditions.\n* Option C (Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill) is incorrect because Lopez cannot review the same play as Megregian, and Megregian must review all three plays.\n* Option D (Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill) is incorrect because Megregian cannot review the same play as Jiang, and Jiang must review only one play.\n* Option E (Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill) is incorrect because Lopez cannot review the same play as Megregian, and Megregian must review all three plays.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
