Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?\nChoices:\n  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.\n  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.\n  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.\n  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.\n  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

This would mean that the second batch of sugar cookies would have to be made on Tuesday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, we can eliminate choice A.\nB: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. This would mean that the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Wednesday, which violates the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B.\nC: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. This would mean that the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Thursday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C.\nD: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. This would mean that the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Wednesday as well, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D.\nE: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This would mean that the first batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Monday, which is allowed. The first batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Thursday. The first batch of sugar cookies could be made on Monday, and the third batch of sugar cookies could be made on Friday. This choice does not violate any of the given conditions.\n\nAction: Answer(\"E\")"
