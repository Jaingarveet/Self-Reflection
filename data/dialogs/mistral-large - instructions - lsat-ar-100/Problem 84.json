At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?\nChoices:\n  A: F, M\n  B: F, H, M\n  C: G, H, K\n  D: F, G, M, O\n  E: G, H, L, M\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions that must apply to the placement of the books.\n2. Determine the minimum number of books that must be placed on each shelf.\n3. Consider the placement of each book based on the given conditions.\n4. Eliminate any options that do not satisfy all the conditions.\n5. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.\n6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.\n7. Choose the answer that satisfies all the conditions.\n"

Conditions:\n\t* More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.\n\t* I is on the middle shelf.\n\t* K is higher than F.\n\t* O is higher than L.\n\t* F and M are on the same shelf.\n2. Minimum books per shelf: at least 2 on each shelf.\n3. Placement of books:\n\t* Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.\n\t* F and M are together, so they can't be on the top shelf (as there would be no room for another book). They can't be on the middle shelf either (since I is there). So, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.\n\t* K is higher than F, so K can't be on the bottom shelf.\n\t* O is higher than L, so L can't be on the top shelf.\n4. Eliminate options:\n\t* A: F, M - Only 2 books, not enough.\n\t* B: F, H, M - Possible.\n\t* C: G, H, K - K can't be on the bottom shelf.\n\t* D: F, G, M, O - O can't be on the bottom shelf if L is on the middle shelf.\n\t* E: G, H, L, M - F and M must be together.\n5. & 6. Logical reasoning and double-check:\n\t* Only option B (F, H, M) satisfies all conditions.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
