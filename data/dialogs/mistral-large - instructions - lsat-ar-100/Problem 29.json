        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.\nQuestion: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.\n  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the conditions that must apply to the placement of the books.\n2. Determine the minimum number of books that must be placed on each shelf.\n3. Use the given conditions to determine the possible placement of each book.\n4. Consider all possible combinations of book placements that satisfy the given conditions.\n5. Eliminate any combinations that violate the given conditions.\n6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the remaining combinations.\n"

Minimum books per shelf: At least 2 books on each shelf.\n3. Possible placements: Since L is higher than H, L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Since O is higher than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf either. Since K is higher than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, M cannot be on the bottom shelf either. Therefore, the bottom shelf must contain H and at least one other book. Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf must contain only two books. Since I is on the middle shelf, the middle shelf must contain at least two books besides I.\n4. Combinations: The only possible combinations that satisfy the given conditions are:\n\t* Bottom shelf: H, G\n\t* Middle shelf: I, F, M\n\t* Top shelf: K, O\n\t* Bottom shelf: H, G, K\n\t* Middle shelf: I, F, M\n\t* Top shelf: O\n5. Elimination: The first combination is not possible because K is higher than F. Therefore, the second combination must be true.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\nReflection:\nI previously answered this question incorrectly because I did not consider all possible combinations of book placements that satisfied the given conditions. I also did not eliminate any combinations that violated the given conditions. To improve my answer, I followed the instructions more carefully and considered all possible combinations of book placements that satisfied the given conditions. I also eliminated any combinations that violated the given conditions. This helped me choose the answer that must be true based on the remaining combinations."
