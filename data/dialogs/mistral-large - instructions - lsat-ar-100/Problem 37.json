The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.\nQuestion: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?\nChoices:\n  A: F, H, P\n  B: H, P. L\n  C: O, P, R\n  D: O, P, T\n  E: P, R, T\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the position of S in the performance order.\n2. Identify the possible positions of O in the performance order.\n3. Identify the possible positions of P in the performance order.\n4. Identify the possible positions of R in the performance order.\n5. Identify the possible positions of T in the performance order.\n6. Identify the possible positions of F in the performance order.\n7. Identify the possible positions of H in the performance order.\n8. Identify the possible positions of L in the performance order.\n9. Consider all possible combinations of compositions that satisfy the given conditions.\n10. Work step-by-step through each combination, eliminating those that violate the given conditions.\n11. Choose the answer that matches the remaining combination.\n"
