Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be false?\nChoices:\n  A: The bay holding fuel is next to the bay holding machinery.\n  B: The bay holding grain is next to the bay holding machinery.\n  C: The bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel.\n  D: The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.\n  E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the relationships between the different types of cargo based on the given information.\n2. Consider all the possible scenarios that satisfy these relationships.\n3. Eliminate the answer choices that are possible based on the given information.\n4. Identify the answer choice that must be false based on the relationships between the different types of cargo.\n5.

This is possible since we don't have any information about the position of Machinery.\n- C: The bay holding livestock is next to the bay holding fuel. This is possible since we don't have any information about the position of Fuel relative to Livestock.\n- D: The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock. This is possible since we don't have any information that contradicts this.\n- E: The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding fuel.
