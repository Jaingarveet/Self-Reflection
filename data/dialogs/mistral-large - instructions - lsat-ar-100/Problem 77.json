Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\nQuestion: For how many of the six new employees is the assignment of a parking space limited to one of only two possible spaces?\nChoices:\n  A: none\n  B: two\n  C: three\n  D: four\n  E: five\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Analyze each rule given in the problem.\n3. Consider the implications of each rule on the possible assignments.\n4. Identify the employees whose assignments are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.\n5. Count the number of employees with such limitations.\n6. Double-check your analysis and calculations.\n7.

Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.\n\nFrom rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of four possible spaces. However, this does not limit Robertson to only two possible spaces.\n\nFrom rule 1, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, and Robertson can only be assigned one of the first four spaces, Young must be assigned one of the first three spaces, and Togowa must be assigned one of the first two spaces. Therefore, Togowa is limited to only two possible spaces.\n\nFrom rule 2, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. However, this does not limit either Xu or Souza to only two possible spaces.\n\nTherefore, only Togowa is limited to only two possible spaces.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
