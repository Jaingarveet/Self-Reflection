Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.\nQuestion: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?\nChoices:\n  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.\n  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.\n  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.\n  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.\n  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the 9 batches must be distributed among Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\nThe second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nIf the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday. However, this would mean that all three batches of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Tuesday and Friday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.\n\nTherefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. The remaining batches of cookies can be distributed among Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday without violating any conditions.\n\nAction: Answer(\"C\") (At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.)"
