Therefore, option A (George and Lenore) is not possible.\n\nIf Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.

Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.\n\nIf Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on the next day. Therefore, if Nina and Helen give reports on the same day, it must be on Wednesday.

Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday. If Irving gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give a report on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so Irving cannot give a report on Tuesday either. Therefore, Irving must give a report on Wednesday. If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia cannot give a report on Wednesday because she cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, option C (Irving and Robert) is not possible.\n\nIf Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Nina must give a report on Tuesday, but Tuesday is the only day George can give a report. Therefore, Kyle cannot give a report on Monday. If Kyle gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give a report on Wednesday. However, George must give a report on Tuesday, so Kyle cannot give a report on Tuesday either. Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle can give a report on Wednesday.
