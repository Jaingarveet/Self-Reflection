Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargoâ€”fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the bay holding livestock?\nChoices:\n  A: bay 1\n  B: bay 2\n  C: bay 3\n  D: bay 5\n  E: bay 6\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the relationships between the cargos.\n2. Identify the constraints on the position of the bay holding livestock.\n3. Eliminate the options that violate the constraints.\n4.

I thought that the bay holding livestock had to be next to the bay holding textiles, but this is not stated in the question. I also did not consider all the possible options for the position of the bay holding livestock.\nTo improve my answer, I identified the relationships between the cargos and the constraints on the position of the bay holding livestock. I eliminated the options that violated the constraints and worked step-by-step through my logical reasoning. I double-checked my reasoning and final answer and verified that the question was well-defined and had a correct answer.\nI learned that it is important to carefully read and interpret the question and to consider all the possible options before selecting an answer. I also learned that it is helpful to use logical reasoning and to double-check my work to ensure accuracy."
