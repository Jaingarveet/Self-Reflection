The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S.

Therefore, T must be performed immediately before F.\n2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since T is performed immediately before F, there must be at least two compositions performed after F and before R.\n3. O is performed either first or fifth.
