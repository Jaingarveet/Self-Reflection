Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?\nChoices:\n  A: Kim, Mahr\n  B: Kim, Tiao\n  C: Parra, Quinn\n  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall\n  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nInstructions:\n1.

Conditions for each sales representative:\n   - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.\n   - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.\n   - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.\n   - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.\n2. Conditions for each sales zone:\n   - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.\n3. Possible scenarios based on the given conditions:\n   - Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 3 representatives.\n   - Parra and Quinn must be together, and Stuckey and Udall must be together. The only way to satisfy this condition and have more representatives in Zone 3 is to have Parra and Quinn in Zone 1 and Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3.\n   - This leaves Tiao, Kim, and Mahr. Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 (since Parra is there) or Zone 2 (since Udall is in Zone 3). Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 3.\n   - This leaves Kim and Mahr for Zone 2.\n4. The scenario that satisfies all the given conditions is:\n   - Zone 1: Parra, Quinn\n   - Zone 2: Kim, Mahr\n   - Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall, Tiao\n\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
