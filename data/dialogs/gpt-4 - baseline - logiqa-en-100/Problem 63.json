This means that the money kept in the bank is not growing as fast as the prices are increasing. Therefore, keeping money in the bank is not profitable. The context also mentions that the growth rate of residents' savings deposits continued to decline, which means people are not depositing as much money in the banks. The best explanation for this would be that people are looking for more profitable ways to use their money.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
