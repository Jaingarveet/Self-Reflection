This is because developed countries benefit from an improved natural environment, while developing countries, despite suffering environmental pollution, gain employment and increased taxes. This doesn't necessarily imply that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries (A), or that the degree of environmental pollution in developed countries is more serious (C). It also doesn't state that both developed and developing countries have polluting enterprises (B). However, it does suggest that polluting industries can generate more profits (in terms of employment and taxes) in developing countries (D).\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
