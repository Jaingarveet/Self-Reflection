If they were hired by Tianji, then Wang could not have been hired by Tianji because if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. So, choice B is incorrect.\n- If only Liu was hired by Tianxuan, then Zhao must have been hired by Tianji. But this would mean that Wang could not have been hired by Tianxuan, contradicting the condition that if Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan. So, choice C is incorrect.\n- If only Wang was hired by Tianxuan, then Zhao and Liu must have been hired by Tianji, which is possible. So, choice D may be correct.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
