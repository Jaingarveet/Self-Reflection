Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument\nChoices:\n  A: overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears\n  B: confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon\n  C: fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well\n  D: fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon\n  E: takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition\n\nThought:\nThe argument claims that crying reduces emotional stress by removing hormones from the body.\nThe argument assumes that the shedding of tears is the only factor that reduces emotional stress.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

However, the argument does not assume that shedding tears is the only factor that reduces emotional stress. Therefore, answer choice A is incorrect. \nThe argument assumes that the presence of certain hormones in tears is the cause of reduced emotional stress. However, the presence of these hormones does not necessarily mean that they are the cause of reduced emotional stress. Therefore, answer choice E is the correct answer.\nError Keywords:\n - Misunderstanding the argument's assumption\n - Misinterpreting the argument's conclusion\n - Incorrectly identifying the argument's vulnerability\nSolution:\nThe argument assumes that the presence of certain hormones in tears is the cause of reduced emotional stress.

Read the question carefully and understand the argument's conclusion.\n2. Identify the argument's assumptions.\n3. Evaluate each answer choice based on how well it addresses the argument's vulnerability.\n4. Choose the answer choice that best addresses the argument's vulnerability.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument's conclusion.\n - Identify the argument's assumptions and evaluate each answer choice based on how well it addresses the argument's vulnerability.\n - Be careful not to misinterpret the argument's conclusion or assumptions.\n - Be aware of common logical fallacies and how to identify them.\n - Practice evaluating arguments to improve your critical thinking skills."
