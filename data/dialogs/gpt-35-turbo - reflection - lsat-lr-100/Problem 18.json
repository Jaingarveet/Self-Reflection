Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive.\nQuestion: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above?\nChoices:\n  A: With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties.\n  B: When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park.\n  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.\n  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.\n  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.\n\nThought:\nThe reasoning in the argument is that when faced with two equally desirable but unfamiliar options, people tend to choose the more expensive one. \nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nOption B is the most similar to the reasoning in the argument. Just as children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse, Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Similarly, when faced with two equally desirable but unfamiliar prizes, Ed chose the more expensive one.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

        "content": "Reflection:\nI incorrectly identified option B as the most similar reasoning to the argument. Although option B involves choosing between two options, it is not based on the same reasoning as the argument. The argument is based on the idea that people tend to choose the more expensive option when faced with two equally desirable but unfamiliar options. Option E is the most similar reasoning to the argument because it involves choosing between two options (doubling back or fleeing for nearby cover) and the choice is based on a specific circumstance (the rabbit being pursued in a field with no nearby cover). \nError Keywords:\n- Misunderstanding\n- Misinterpretation\n- Lack of attention to detail\nSolution:\nThe most similar reasoning to the argument is option E. Just as the rabbit being pursued in a field with no nearby cover will try to double back on the fox, Ed chose the more expensive prize when faced with two equally desirable but unfamiliar options.\nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.\n2. Identify the reasoning in the argument.\n3. Read each option carefully and identify the reasoning in each option.\n4. Compare the reasoning in each option to the reasoning in the argument.\n5. Choose the option that is most similar to the reasoning in the argument.\nAdvice:\n- Pay close attention to the reasoning in the argument.\n- Read each option carefully and identify the reasoning in each option.\n- Compare the reasoning in each option to the reasoning in the argument.\n- Eliminate options that are not based on the same reasoning as the argument.\n- Choose the option that is most similar to the reasoning in the argument."
