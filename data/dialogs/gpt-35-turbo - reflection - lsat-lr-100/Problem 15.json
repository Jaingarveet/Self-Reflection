But you're already unhappy, so you might as well just quit.\nQuestion: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it\nChoices:\n  A: fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance\n  B: relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true\n  C: mischaracterize what Brooks says\n  D: conllates two different types of risk\n  E: reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case\n\nThought:\nMorgenstern argues that the only risk in quitting is not finding another job and that Brooks is already unhappy, so he might as well quit.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nMorgenstern's argument relies on an assumption that finding another job is easy, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the argument is flawed. Choice A is incorrect because it is not relevant to the argument. Choice C is incorrect because Morgenstern's argument does not mischaracterize what Brooks says. Choice D is incorrect because Morgenstern's argument does not conflate two different types of risk. Choice E is incorrect because Morgenstern's argument is not based on a single case.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
