Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

However, it is not directly related to the phenomenon described in the question. \nChoice D is the correct answer because it provides a direct explanation for the phenomenon. If most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed, then it makes sense that highways with the most traffic, which tend to have slower-moving traffic, would have a lower rate of fatal accidents.\nError Keywords:\n - Incorrect reasoning\n - Not directly related\n - Misunderstanding the question\nSolution:\nThe correct answer is D because it provides a direct explanation for the phenomenon described in the question. \nInstructions:\n1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n2. Evaluate each answer choice carefully and eliminate those that are clearly incorrect.\n3. Look for answer choices that provide a direct explanation for the phenomenon described in the question.\n4. Choose the answer choice that best explains the phenomenon.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.\n - Evaluate each answer choice carefully and eliminate those that are clearly incorrect.\n - Look for answer choices that provide a direct explanation for the phenomenon described in the question.\n - Be aware of answer choices that are not directly related to the question."
