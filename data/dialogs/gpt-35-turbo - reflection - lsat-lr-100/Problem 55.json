Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?\nChoices:\n  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.\n  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.\n  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.\n  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.\n  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. The conclusion is that Tolstoy's claim is rash. We need to find an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.\nAction: Answer(\"B\") \nExplanation: \nOption B states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. This assumption enables the conclusion to be properly drawn because it supports the idea that Tolstoy's claim is rash. If the responsibility for an action is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, then it is possible to praise or blame a person for an action even if we do not know a lot about the events that led to that action.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
