Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.\nQuestion: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?\nChoices:\n  A: It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound.\n  B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.\n  C: People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds.\n  D: Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound.\n  E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The assumption on which the argument depends should be related to this perception.\nOption A is too extreme and not necessary for the argument. Option B is not relevant to the argument. Option D is not related to the perception of native speakers. Option E is not relevant to the argument. Option C seems to be the most relevant assumption as it suggests that people pay more attention to the way an unfamiliar language sounds, which is why they hear an uninterrupted stream of sound instead of distinct words.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
