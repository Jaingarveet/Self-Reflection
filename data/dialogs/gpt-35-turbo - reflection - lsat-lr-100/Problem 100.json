Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument?\nChoices:\n  A: In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.\n  B: In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal.\n  C: Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime.\n  D: In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed.\n  E: If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred.\n\nThought:\nThe argument is that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery because they have instituted identical penalties for both crimes.\nTo strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is indeed equal to the harm resulting from bribery.\nAction: Answer(\"D\") \nExplanation: \nChoice D provides evidence that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery. If the harm to the victim is the same in both cases, then it makes sense for lawmakers to institute identical penalties for both crimes.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
