However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.\nQuestion: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?\nChoices:\n  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.\n  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.\n  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.\n  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.\n  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.\n\nThought:\nThe journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.

However, the journalist's argument is more specific than that; it assumes that the physician who critiqued the book is biased because he is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. Answer choice D correctly identifies this vulnerability in the journalist's argument.\nError Keywords:\n - Overgeneralization\n - Misinterpretation\n - Assumption\nSolution:\nThe journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. This argument assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. However, it is possible that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. Therefore, the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.\nInstructions:\n1.
