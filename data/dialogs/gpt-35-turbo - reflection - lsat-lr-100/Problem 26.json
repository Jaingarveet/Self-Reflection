        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.\nQuestion: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?\nChoices:\n  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.\n  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.\n  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.\n  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.\n  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.\n\nThought:\nThe passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. It also mentions that horror stories about mad scientists express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor, while horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. \nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"

This statement is too broad and not supported by the passage. The passage only states that horror stories, which describe violations of the laws of nature, are intended to produce dread in the reader. \nThe correct answer is E, which states that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. This statement is true based on the passage, which states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. \nError Keywords:\n - Overgeneralization\n - Misinterpretation\n - Unsupported assumption\nSolution:\nThe passage states that both kinds of horror stories describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader.
