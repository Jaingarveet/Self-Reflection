        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: People often admonish us to learn the lessons of history, but, even if it were easy to discover what the past was really like, it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons. We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I.\nQuestion: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways?\nChoices:\n  A: It sets out a problem the argument as a whole is designed to resolve.\n  B: It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.\n  C: It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false.\n  D: It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.\n  E: It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion.\n\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\nExplanation: \nThe argument acknowledges that people often encourage us to learn the lessons of history, but it questions the feasibility of doing so. The argument does not take a position on whether we should or should not learn the lessons of history. Therefore, the statement \"That we should learn the lessons of history\" is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
