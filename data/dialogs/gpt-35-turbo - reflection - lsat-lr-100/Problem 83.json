Therefore, the assumption must be related to this fact.\nOption A is incorrect because there are celestial bodies that can be both a moon and a planet.\nOption B is a possible assumption because it suggests that having an atmosphere and orbiting the sun are not sufficient conditions to be a true planet.\nOption C is not necessary to the argument because it does not explain why Pluto is not a true planet.\nOption D is incorrect because the size of a celestial body is relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.\nOption E is incorrect because it is not necessary for a celestial body to form in orbit around the sun exclusively to be a true planet.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: E"
