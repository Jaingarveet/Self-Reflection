        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nQuestion: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?\nChoices:\n  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.\n  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.\n  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.\n  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.\n\nThought:\nThe study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.\nWe need to find an option that explains why the level of nicotine in the blood is the same regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes.\nAction: Answer(\"C\") \nOption C explains that most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. This means that even if a smoker smokes low-nicotine cigarettes, they will still absorb most of the nicotine in the cigarette, resulting in the same level of nicotine in the blood as a smoker who smokes high-nicotine cigarettes.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: A"
