        "content": "Topic: Law\nContext: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.\nQuestion: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?\nChoices:\n  A: We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.\n  B: We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.\n  C: For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.\n  D: Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds.\n  E: We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.\n\nThought:\nThe radio producer is faced with a choice between two options, one of which is more popular but less loyal, and the other is less popular but more loyal. The producer chooses the more popular option because it generates more revenue.\nAction: Answer(\"A\") \nExplanation: \nOption A is the most similar in pattern of reasoning to the radio producer's argument. Both arguments present a choice between two options, and then eliminate one option based on a specific reason. In the radio producer's argument, the less popular option is eliminated because it does not generate enough revenue. In option A, the more expensive option is eliminated because of cost concerns.\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: B"

However, the reason for eliminating one option in option A is different from the reason for eliminating one option in the radio producer's argument. In option A, the more expensive option is eliminated because of cost concerns, while in the radio producer's argument, the less popular option is eliminated because it does not generate enough revenue.
