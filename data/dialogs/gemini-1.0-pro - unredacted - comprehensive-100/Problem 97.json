This error stemmed from a misunderstanding of the inheritance pattern of the disease. While it involves the X chromosome, HVDRR is actually an X-linked **dominant** disorder, not recessive.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* **Inheritance pattern misinterpretation:** Incorrectly classifying the mode of inheritance (dominant vs. recessive)\n* **X-linked confusion:** Failing to distinguish between X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive traits\n**Solution:**\n1. **Identify the gene involved:** HVDRR is caused by mutations in the PHEX gene located on the X chromosome.\n2. **Recall X-linked inheritance:** X-linked dominant traits require only one mutated copy of the gene on the X chromosome to manifest the disease in both males and females.\n3. **Recognize the implication:** Since only one mutated copy is needed, even males with only one X chromosome are affected.\n**Instructions for Future Reference:**\n1. **Carefully analyze the inheritance pattern:** Pay close attention to whether the trait is dominant or recessive, especially for X-linked conditions.\n2. **Consider the implications of X-linked inheritance:** Remember that males with X-linked dominant disorders will exhibit the disease regardless of the other X chromosome.\n3. **Consult reliable sources:** Refer to medical textbooks, reputable online resources, or consult with medical professionals to confirm the inheritance pattern of the disease.\n**General Advice for Similar Problems:**\n* **Thoroughly understand the underlying concepts:** Ensure a strong grasp of basic genetic principles, including inheritance patterns and X-linked traits.\n* **Actively recall relevant information:** Before attempting to answer, refresh your knowledge about the specific disease or condition in question.\n* **Double-check your reasoning:** Take the time to review your thought process and ensure it aligns with the known facts about the disease.\n* **Seek clarification when unsure:** If any aspect of the question or the disease is unclear, don't hesitate to consult reliable sources or seek expert advice.\n"
