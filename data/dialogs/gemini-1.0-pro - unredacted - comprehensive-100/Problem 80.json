While liquids can change shape and volume under certain conditions, the question specifically asks about what happens when a liquid is transferred to a larger container. In this scenario, the liquid will retain its volume, even though its shape will change to conform to the new container.\n## Error Keywords:\n* **Distracted by irrelevant information:** I focused on the ability of liquids to change shape and volume in general, instead of focusing on the specific scenario described in the question.\n* **Misinterpretation of the question:** I did not correctly interpret the meaning of \"retain its volume\" in the context of the question.\n## Solution:\n1. **Identify the key information:** The question asks about the behavior of a liquid when transferred to a larger container.\n2. **Recall the relevant property of liquids:** Liquids have a definite volume, meaning they occupy a specific amount of space.\n3. **Apply the property to the scenario:** When transferred to a larger container, the liquid will spread out to fill the available space, but its overall volume will remain the same.\n4. **Choose the answer that reflects this property:** Option A correctly states that the liquid will retain its volume.\n## Instructions for future:\n1. **Read the question carefully and identify the key information.**\n2. **Focus on the specific scenario described in the question.**\n3. **Recall the relevant properties of the substance or concept being tested.**\n4. **Apply these properties to the scenario and choose the answer that best reflects the outcome.**\n5. **Double-check your understanding of the question and the answer choices before making your final selection.**\n## General advice:\n* **Avoid making assumptions:** Don't assume you know what the question is asking before you read it carefully.\n* **Break down complex questions into smaller parts:** This can help you focus on the key information and identify the relevant properties.\n* **Use your knowledge of the subject to eliminate incorrect answers:** This can help you narrow down your choices and increase your chances of selecting the correct answer.\n* **Don't be afraid to guess if you are unsure:** If you are stuck between two answers, it is better to guess than to leave the question blank.\n"
