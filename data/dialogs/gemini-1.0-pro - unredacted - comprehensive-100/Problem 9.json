What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road?\nChoices:\n  A: 800\n  B: 720\n  C: 960\n  D: 1140\n  E: 1160\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial solution involved multiplying the map distance (20 inches) by the scale (10 miles/inch), resulting in an incorrect answer of 200 miles. The error stemmed from misinterpreting the scale as a direct conversion factor instead of a ratio.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation of scale\n* Ratio error\n* Unit conversion error\n**Correct Solution:**\n1. **Identify the scale:** 1/4 inch represents 10 miles.\n2. **Convert map distance to actual distance:** 20 inches * (10 miles/ 1/4 inch) = 800 miles.\n**Detailed Instructions:**\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information: map distance and scale.\n2. Understand the scale as a ratio, not a direct conversion factor.\n3. Set up a proportion to convert map distance to actual distance: (map distance) / (scale) = (actual distance) / 1.\n4. Solve the proportion for the actual distance.\n5. Double-check the units and calculations.\n**General Advice:**\n* Pay close attention to the units involved in the problem.\n* Interpret the scale correctly as a ratio, not a direct conversion factor.\n* Set up proportions to convert between different units.\n* Double-check calculations and units before submitting the answer.\n**Additional Notes:**\n* In this specific problem, the answer choices were far apart, making it easier to identify the significant error in my initial calculation.\n* Practicing with similar problems and focusing on understanding the underlying concepts can help prevent such errors in the future.\n"
