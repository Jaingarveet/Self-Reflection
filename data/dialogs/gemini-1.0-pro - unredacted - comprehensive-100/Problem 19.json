Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n2. Determine whether the conclusion is true or false.\n3. If the conclusion is false, identify the premises of the argument.\n4. Determine whether each premise is true or false.\n5. If one of the premises is false, identify which premise is false and why.\n6. If all of the premises are true, then the argument is logically sound.\n7. If one or more of the premises are false, then the argument is logically unsound.\nAdvice:\n - Always carefully consider the truth value of each premise in a logical argument.\n - Remember that a false premise can lead to a false conclusion, even if the other premises are true.\n - Be aware of the possibility of absurd conclusions, which can indicate a false premise.\n - Distinguish between logical statements and metaphorical or subjective statements.\n"
