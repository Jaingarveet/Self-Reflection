If the lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively. What is the length of line segment RU?\nChoices:\n  A: 6\n  B: 7\n  C: 8\n  D: 9\n  E: 10\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\n## Reflection on Incorrect Answer\n**Explanation:**\nMy initial approach was correct in identifying U as the midpoint of ST and calculating the length of SU as 11. However, I made a crucial error in adding the lengths of RS and SU to find RU. Since U is the midpoint, the length of RU is actually half the length of ST, not the sum of RS and SU.\n**Error Keywords:**\n* Misinterpretation of midpoint concept\n* Addition instead of division for midpoint calculation\n* Failure to consider midpoint property in final calculation\n**Solution:**\n1. Identify U as the midpoint of ST.\n2. Calculate the length of SU as half the length of ST: 22 / 2 = 11.\n3. Recognize that RU is half the length of ST due to U being the midpoint.\n4. Calculate the length of RU: 22 / 2 = 11.\n**Instructions for Future:**\n1. Carefully read and understand the definition of midpoint.\n2. Remember that the midpoint divides a line segment into two segments of equal length.\n3. When dealing with midpoints, focus on division rather than addition to find lengths of related segments.\n4. Double-check calculations and interpretations to ensure they align with the problem's context.\n**General Advice:**\n* Visualize the problem using diagrams or sketches.\n* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.\n* Apply relevant formulas and properties accurately.\n* Pay close attention to keywords and specific details in the problem statement.\n* Don't rush; take your time to think through each step logically.\n"
