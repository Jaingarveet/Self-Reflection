        "content": "Topic: Logic\nContext: In the past, we had a lot of unrealistic high-profile in moral propaganda, so that a lot of the population said one thing and made one behind the other, and split personality.Through thinking about this phenomenon, some scholars have proposed that we should only ask ordinary people to abide by the \"bottom line ethics\".\nQuestion: Based on your understanding, which of the following options is most appropriate as the definition of \"bottom line ethics\"?\nChoices:\n  A: The bottom line ethics is not to steal or kill.\n  B: The bottom line ethics are some of the most basic and basic codes of conduct and rules that should be observed by ordinary people in a society.\n  C: The bottom line ethics is not an ethics that requires selfless dedication.\n  D: If one compares human morality to a building, the bottom line ethics is the fundamental part of that building.\nReflection:\nYou previously answered this question incorrectly.\nThen you reflected on the problem, your solution, and the correct answer.\nUse your self-reflection (below) to help you answer this question.\nAny information that you are not allowed to see will be marked [REDACTED].\nExplanation:\nI misinterpreted the passage and focused on the metaphor in option D instead of the direct definition in option B. \nMy error was in prioritizing a figurative explanation over a literal definition.\nError Keywords:\n - Figurative language error\n - Metaphor misinterpretation\n - Definition confusion\nSolution:\nThe passage defines \"bottom line ethics\" as basic codes of conduct that should be observed by ordinary people in a society.\nOption A is too specific and does not encompass all aspects of \"bottom line ethics.\"\nOption B directly matches the definition provided in the passage.\nOption C is not a definition but rather a statement about what \"bottom line ethics\" is not.\nOption D is a metaphor that accurately describes the role of \"bottom line ethics\" as the foundation of human morality, but it is not the definition itself.\nInstructions:\n1. Carefully read the passage and identify the key concepts.\n2. Identify the question being asked and the options provided.\n3. Analyze each option and compare it to the definition or description provided in the passage.\n4. Choose the option that most accurately matches the definition or description.\n5. Do not prioritize figurative language over literal definitions.\nAdvice:\n - Pay close attention to the wording of the question and the answer choices.\n - Look for keywords and phrases that match the concepts presented in the passage.\n - Be cautious of figurative language and metaphors, as they may not be the literal definition.\n - If unsure, eliminate options that are clearly incorrect or do not match the passage.\n - Choose the option that provides the most accurate and comprehensive definition or description.\n"
