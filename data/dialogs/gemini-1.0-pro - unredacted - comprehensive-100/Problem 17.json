Carefully read the argument and identify the main points.\n2. Identify the conclusion of the argument.\n3. Identify the evidence provided to support the conclusion.\n4. Identify any assumptions made in the argument.\n5. Evaluate the assumptions and determine if they are valid.\n6. Based on your evaluation of the assumptions, determine if the conclusion is valid.\nAdvice:\n - Pay attention to the details of the argument.\n - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.\n - Evaluate the assumptions carefully and determine if they are valid.\n - Consider alternative explanations for the evidence provided.\n - Be cautious about drawing conclusions based on limited evidence.\n"
