Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the specific logical fallacy in the original argument. 
The argument presents a false cause fallacy, implying a causal relationship between shopping frequency and frozen dinner purchases without sufficient evidence. 
I focused on the generalization aspect, ignoring the causal inference.
