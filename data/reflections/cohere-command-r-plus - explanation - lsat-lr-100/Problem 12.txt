Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the presented options and failed to consider the broader context of the argument's structure. I was misled by the mention of "mutually exclusive" options, which is not the main issue here. The correct answer, choice [REDACTED], points out a more fundamental flaw in the argument's reasoning.
