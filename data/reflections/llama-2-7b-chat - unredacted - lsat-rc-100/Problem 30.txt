  Great job! Your answer is correct. Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" most likely involves enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws, which is option B.

Here's a breakdown of the other options:

A: Enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible is not the best answer because the passage does not suggest that the agency's resources limit its ability to enforce the law.

B: Enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws is the best answer because the passage suggests that the agency exercises its power to nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators, which implies that it is enforcing the law in accordance with the legislature's intent.

C: Prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes is not the best answer because the passage does not suggest that the agency prioritizes enforcement based on the severity of the crime.

D: Not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law is not the best answer because the passage does not suggest that the agency misunderstands the difference between the two.

E: Not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law is the best answer because the passage suggests that the agency exercises its power to nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators, which implies that it is enforcing the law in accordance with the legislature's intent.

Great job! Let me know if you have any other questions.
