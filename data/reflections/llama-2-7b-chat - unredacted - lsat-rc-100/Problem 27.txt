  Great, let's break down the answer:

According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society. This means that Dostoyevsky believed that realism should not be limited to representing political views or serving a particular political purpose, but rather should strive to explore the boundaries of the "real world" and create a new reality through the use of fantasy and imagination.

So, the correct answer is (D) Realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society.

Now, let's analyze the other options:

Option (A) Reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals: This is not directly related to Dostoyevsky's view of realism.

Option (B) Realism is unequal to the task of representing political views: Dostoyevsky did not disagree with this view, as he believed that realism should be used to expose social inequities and contribute to the creation of a new society.

Option (C) Art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality: Dostoyevsky did not believe that art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality. Instead, he believed that realism should be used to explore the boundaries of the "real world" and create a new reality through the use of fantasy and imagination.

Option (E) Reality is not the crucial source of successful literature: Dostoyevsky believed that reality was the crucial source of successful literature, as he believed that art should be grounded in the experiences of individuals and the world around them.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (D) Realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society, as Dostoyevsky believed that realism should strive to explore the boundaries of the "real world" and create a new reality through the use of fantasy and imagination.
