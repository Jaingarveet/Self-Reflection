  Great, let's break down the answer:

Option C is the correct answer because the passage suggests that Morrison's use of narrative techniques inspired by jazz allows her to create a sense of ensemble playing among the characters, with each character's voice contributing to the overall narrative in a way that is reminiscent of jazz music. The passage states that "Morrison develops her narrative in such a way that the voices of individual characters are sometimes difficult to distinguish, in much the same way that individual musicians' voices merge in ensemble jazz playing." This suggests that Morrison is using techniques similar to those used in jazz music to create a sense of collaboration and interconnectedness among the characters in her novel.

Option A is incorrect because while the passage does mention that Mortison's novel represents a successful attempt to create a narrative style inspired by jazz, it does not suggest that she has perfected this style in a way that had been attempted with little success by other North American writers in the twentieth century.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage does mention that Mortison's novel represents the most successful representation to date of the milieu in which jazz musicians live and work, it does not suggest that this is the primary focus of the passage.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage does mention that the structural analogy between Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositional style involves more than simply the technique of shifting between first-person and third-person narrators, it does not provide enough information to support this answer.

Option E is incorrect because while the passage does mention that Morrison disguises the important structural connections between her narrative and Duke Ellington's jazz compositions, it does not suggest that she does this by making the transitions between first- and third-person narrators appear easy.

Overall, the passage highlights the innovative use of narrative techniques inspired by jazz in Morrison's novel Jazz, particularly in the way she structures the story through shifts between first-person and third-person narrators.
