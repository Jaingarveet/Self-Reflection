  Great, you have provided the correct answer! The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" primarily to refer to the royalties paid to authors by their publishers, which is option C.

Here's a summary of the answer:

* The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" to refer to the royalties paid to authors by their publishers.
* This is evident from the context of the passage, which discusses the potential for digital publishing to reduce the costs associated with traditional publishing.
* The author notes that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product, and therefore would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
* This suggests that the author is primarily concerned with the financial implications of digital publishing for authors, rather than other categories of expense mentioned in the passage.

Great job! Let me know if you have any other questions.
