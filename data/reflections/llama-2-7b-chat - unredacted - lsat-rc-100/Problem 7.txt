  Great, let's break down the answer choices for the question according to the passage:

A: helped spread the genes responsible for those same behaviors

The passage does not provide evidence to support this answer choice. While it is true that the behaviors in question (altruism and empathy) may have contributed to the survival and replication of the genes responsible for those behaviors, the passage does not suggest that this was the primary driver of their evolution.

B: prompted individuals to behave unselfishly

This is the correct answer. According to the passage, the psychological experiences of identification and empathy likely arose in response to cues that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. These experiences could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.

C: improved the physical health of individuals who exhibited the behaviors

The passage does not provide evidence to support this answer choice. While it is possible that certain behaviors may have improved the physical health of individuals, the passage does not suggest that this was a primary driver of their evolution.

D: made individuals who exhibited the behaviors more adept at finding food

The passage does not provide evidence to support this answer choice. While it is possible that certain behaviors may have provided individuals with an advantage in finding food, the passage does not suggest that this was a primary driver of their evolution.

E: prompted early humans to live in mutually dependent groups

The passage does not provide evidence to support this answer choice. While it is true that early humans may have lived in small, kin-based groups, the passage does not suggest that this was the primary reason for the evolution of altruistic mechanisms.

In conclusion, the correct answer is (B) prompted individuals to behave unselfishly.
