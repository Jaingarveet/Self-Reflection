  Great, let's break down the passage and analyze the information provided to determine the correct answer:

The passage mentions Duke Ellington in the context of Toni Morrison's novel Jazz, and how Morrison has found a way to create a sense of ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. The author, Robert O'Meally, highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.

Now, let's look at the options:

A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.

The passage does not provide any explicit credit to Ellington for inspiring Morrison's style of narration. While it is mentioned that Ellington perfected the art of composition, particularly in the context of jazz, there is no mention of him inspiring Morrison's narrative style. Therefore, option A is not supported by the passage.

B: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.

The passage does not provide any information to suggest that Ellington prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos. In fact, the passage highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. This suggests that Ellington was not opposed to lengthy solos or improvisations, but rather, he had a deliberate approach to composition that allowed for both individual expression and collective unity. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.

The passage does not mention Ellington as a minor character in Morrison's Jazz. In fact, the passage highlights his significance as a genius of music who perfected the art of composition, particularly in the context of jazz. Therefore, option C is not supported by the passage.

D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he conducted.

The passage does not provide any information to suggest that Ellington composed music specifically for the musicians he conducted. In fact, the passage highlights Ellington's ability to construct his compositions with individual musicians in mind, allowing them to improvise within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. This suggests that Ellington's compositions were not specifically tailored to any particular musician, but rather, he allowed for individual expression within the framework of his compositions. Therefore, option D is not supported by the passage.

E: Though he composed and conducted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

The passage does not provide any information about Ellington's compositional style beyond jazz. While it is mentioned that Ellington perfected the art of composition, particularly in the context of jazz, there is no mention of him composing music of other genres. Therefore, option E is not supported by the passage.

Therefore, the best answer is option B: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
