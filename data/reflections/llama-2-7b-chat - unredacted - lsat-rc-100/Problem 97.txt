The author of passage B seeks to undermine the type of argument made in passage A by suggesting that it relies on questionable reasoning.

Therefore, the best answer is (B) - The author of passage B argues that the type of argument made in passage A is flawed by attempting to create an analogous argument with a clearly false conclusion.
