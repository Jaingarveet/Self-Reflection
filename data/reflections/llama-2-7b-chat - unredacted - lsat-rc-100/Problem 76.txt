  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (B) The conclusion that alcohol affects lipid processing should be questioned in light of studies of moderate wine consumption.

The passage suggests that the author would agree with this statement because it challenges the assumption that alcohol has negative physiological effects and suggests that the effects of wine may be distinct from other alcoholic beverages. The passage highlights the findings of researchers who have investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption and found that it has healthful effects, such as increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound and reduced levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. These findings challenge the conclusion that alcohol affects lipid processing and suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the effects of alcohol on lipid processing.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

(A) Scientists should not attempt to study the possible healthful effects of moderate consumption of beer and distilled spirits. The passage does not suggest that scientists should not study the effects of other alcoholic beverages, and in fact, highlights the need to reevaluate the conclusion about alcohol's effects on lipid processing in light of the findings on wine consumption.

(C) Moderate consumption of wine made from plums or apples rather than grapes would be unlikely to reduce the risk of premature heart disease. The passage does not provide any information about the effects of wine made from plums or apples, and it is not clear whether these types of wine would have the same healthful effects as wine made from grapes.

(D) Red wine consumption has a greater effect on reducing death rates from premature heart disease than does white wine consumption. The passage does not provide any information about the effect of red wine consumption on death rates from premature heart disease, and it is not clear whether red wine has a greater effect than white wine.

(E) Beer and distilled spirits contain active ingredients other than alcohol whose effects tend to be beneficial. The passage does not provide any information about the active ingredients in beer and distilled spirits, and it is not clear whether these ingredients have beneficial effects.
