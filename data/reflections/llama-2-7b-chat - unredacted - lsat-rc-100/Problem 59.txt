  My apologies, you are correct. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("D")

The passage suggests that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was necessary for the success of the campaign, rather than arbitrary or inflexible. The author states that the strategy involved "sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision," which was essential for selecting the right cases to pursue and achieving success in the campaign. Therefore, the best answer is (D) necessary.
