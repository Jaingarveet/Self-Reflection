  Great, you've provided a clear explanation of why you chose option (C) as the correct answer. Here's a summary of your reasoning:

* The passage suggests that secondary substances in plants are the result of genetic mutations.
* Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects to blossoms, signaling the presence of nectar without damage to the plants.
* Other secondary substances arose through mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, which are primarily insects.
* The passage implies that insects play a role in shaping the chemical composition of plants through chemical reactions, and that some secondary substances are adapted to deter or repel insects.

Based on this reasoning, option (C) is the best answer.

Now, let's review the passage to confirm the accuracy of your answer:

The passage states that "the characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition." It goes on to explain that plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.

The passage then discusses the role of insects in shaping the chemical composition of plants: "Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selectionâ€”that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing."

The passage also highlights the adaptive nature of secondary substances in plants: "Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects."

Overall, the passage suggests that secondary substances in plants are shaped by a combination of genetic mutations and natural selection, with insects playing a significant role in this process. This supports your answer, option (C). Great job!
