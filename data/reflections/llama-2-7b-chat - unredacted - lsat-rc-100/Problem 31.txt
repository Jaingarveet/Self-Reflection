  My apologies, thank you for pointing that out. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is (D) Most of the residences with outstanding water bills are in the city's high-income neighborhoods.

The passage suggests that the city's current method of collecting water debts, which involves selectively cutting off the water of high-income residents, is not a viable solution. This is because the law prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and therefore, attaching a lien to the property is not an option. The passage also implies that changing the law would be easier and politically smarter than continuing to use the current method. Therefore, the only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes, which would allow for the attachment of liens to the property.
