  Great job! Your answer is correct. According to the passage, the physics community during the 1930s reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split, but did not recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.

Here's a summary of the passage's main points:

* In the 1930s, a group of Italian physicists bombarded uranium with neutrons, leading to the discovery of nuclear fission.
* Exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, but her findings were not immediately recognized by the physics community.
* The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen.
* Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that atoms could be split, but these calculations were not taken seriously.
* Meitner and her research partner Otto Hahn identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, including barium, which was conclusively identified as an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism involved in the experiments.
* Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and coined the term "nuclear fission."
