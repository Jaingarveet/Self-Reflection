  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (C) forming monogamous families.

The passage suggests that evolutionary psychology may be oversimplifying the explanations for human behavior by attributing them to genetic interests that individuals are not consciously aware of. The passage argues that this approach can lead to questionable explanations, such as the idea that humans form monogamous families solely to propagate their genes. The passage states, "What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest."

Therefore, option (C) forming monogamous families is an example of a human characteristic for which evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation, as the passage suggests that the interest in propagating genes may not be the only or even the primary reason why humans form monogamous families.

Great job!
