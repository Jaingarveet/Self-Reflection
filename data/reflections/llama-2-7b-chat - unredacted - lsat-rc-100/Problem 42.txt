  Great, let's break down the passage and analyze why option (E) is the best answer.

The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in the art world. This suggests that Lichtenstein's work is not overly complex or pretentious, but rather straightforward and direct.

The passage also highlights Lichtenstein's faith in reconciliation between cartoons and fine art, and between parody and true feeling. This implies that Lichtenstein's work is not just a simple parody of comic books, but rather a genuine attempt to reconcile two seemingly disparate art forms.

Therefore, the example of pop art that is most in keeping with the spirit of Lichtenstein's work is (D) a painting that employs vague shapes and images to make a statement about consumer culture. This option best aligns with the passage's description of Lichtenstein's work as a commentary on contemporary life and culture, rather than a personal expression of emotions or a parody of fine art.

The passage does not mention anything about realistic techniques, stick figures, or inner turmoil. Option (A) does not fit the description provided in the passage. Option (B) is a parody of human figures, which is similar to Lichtenstein's work, but the passage does not suggest that this is the most in keeping with the spirit of his work. Option (C) conveys the creator's inner turmoil, which is not in line with Lichtenstein's deliberate naivete and faith in reconciliation.

In conclusion, the best answer is (E) a painting that employs vague shapes and images to make a statement about consumer culture. This option aligns with the passage's description of Lichtenstein's work and best captures the spirit of his art.
