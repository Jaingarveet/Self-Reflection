  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (D) There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers.

The passage suggests that with the shift towards digital publishing, the cost savings and efficiency gains will lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional publishing services such as copy editing and book design. This is because digital publishing allows for more automation and streamlining of the publishing process, which reduces the need for these services.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

(A) The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books is not supported by the passage. While it is true that the demand for paper and binding material may increase, the passage does not suggest that the need for warehousing will shift in this way.

(B) The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly is not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention used book stores or suggest that their patronage will increase.

(C) Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers is not supported by the passage. While the passage does suggest that digital publishing will make traditional publishing less expensive and more efficient, it does not suggest that publishers will start selling their own books directly to consumers.

(E) The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly is not supported by the passage. While it is true that the demand for paper may decrease with the shift towards digital publishing, the passage does not suggest that this will happen significantly.

Overall, the passage suggests that the shift towards digital publishing will lead to a decrease in the demand for traditional publishing services such as copy editing and book design, so option (D) is the correct answer.
