  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (C) Subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice.

The passage suggests that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the natural compounds found in grapes, which are not present in other alcoholic beverages. The study mentioned in the passage found that individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice had decreased platelet adhesiveness, which may be the first step in confirming the speculation that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes.

Therefore, if a study were to show that subjects who drank grape juice exhibited greater platelet adhesiveness than did subjects who drank no grape juice, this would provide further evidence to support the passage's position that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the natural compounds found in grapes.

The other options do not provide strong evidence to support the passage's position:

Option (A) is not relevant to the passage's argument, as it does not provide any information about the relationship between grape juice consumption and platelet adhesiveness.

Option (B) is also not relevant, as the passage does not compare the lipid levels in the bloodstreams of wine drinkers and beer drinkers.

Option (D) is incorrect, as the passage does not suggest that excessive wine consumption leads to premature heart disease at the same rate as moderate wine consumption.

Option (E) is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about a gene that is associated with the clot-breaking compound.
