  Great, let's break down the answer choices:

A) Most of the physical features characteristic of modern humans developed as the result of evolutionary pressures. - This is not directly related to the argument made in passage B, so the author would not regard it as a mistaken assumption.

B) Any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation. - This is the incorrect assumption that the author of passage B would argue against. The author suggests that evolutionary psychology oversimplifies the relationship between genes and behavior, implying that every action is driven by genetic interests without considering other motivations.

C) To explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. - This is a correct assumption, as the author of passage A argues that understanding the evolutionary origins of a behavior can help explain why it exists.

D) Evolutionary psychology can be used to explain human behavior but not animal behavior, since animal behavior is driven largely by instinct. - This is not directly related to the argument made in passage B, so the author would not regard it as a mistaken assumption.

E) Most early human behaviors that significantly hindered reproductive success were eliminated by evolutionary competition. - This is a correct assumption, as the author of passage A argues that evolutionary pressures can shape behavior over time.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation.
