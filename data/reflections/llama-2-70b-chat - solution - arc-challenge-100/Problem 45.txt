Solution:
The weight of an object on the moon is about one-sixth of its weight on Earth, because the moon has only about one-sixth of the Earth's gravity.
So, the weight of the astronaut on the moon is about 31/6 = 5 pounds.
The mass of the astronaut is not affected by the location, so it remains at 84 kilograms.
The weight of the astronaut on Earth would be 5 x 6 = 30 pounds.
