Solution:
When a piece of wood is burned in a fire, a chemical reaction occurs, and the wood is converted into ash, smoke, and heat. This process is irreversible, meaning the wood cannot be restored to its original state. However, the energy in the wood is not destroyed; it is transformed into other forms, such as heat and light.
