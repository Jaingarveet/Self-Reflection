Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. The density of red-clay bricks is 2000 kg/m^3.
2. The density of air is 1 kg/m^3.
3. The volume of [REDACTED] is 2 cubic meters.
4. The mass of [REDACTED] is 2 x 2000 = 4000 kg.
5. The volume of [REDACTED] is 6000 cubic meters.
6. The mass of [REDACTED] is 6000 x 1 = 6000 kg.
7. Comparing the masses, we see that 4000 kg is less than 6000 kg.
8. Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
