Solution:
[REDACTED] toy car rolls at a constant speed down a straight inclined track.
When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the force of friction acts on the car, causing it to slow down and decrease in speed.
The forces influencing the car are not balanced, as the force of friction is greater than the force of gravity, causing the car to slow down.
