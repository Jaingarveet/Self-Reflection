Instructions:
1. Understand the original constraint: if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne is assigned.
2. Understand that this does not mean if Kayne is assigned, then Jaramillo is assigned.
3. Look for a choice that maintains the one-way relationship and does not allow both Jaramillo and Kayne to be assigned.
4. Choose the answer that matches this logic.
