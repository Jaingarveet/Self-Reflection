Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the plays each student reviews based on the conditions.
3. If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, it does not mean that Lopez and Megregian also do not review Tamerlane.
4. Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review Tamerlane.
5. Choose the answer that matches your conclusion.
