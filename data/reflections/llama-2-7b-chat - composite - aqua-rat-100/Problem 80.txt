Explanation:
Great job on breaking down the problem step by step! You identified the key elements of the problem and used logical reasoning to arrive at the solution.

To summarize, the problem states that Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for Rs. 100, and he pays Rs. 1 more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. You correctly identified the variables in the problem, including w (the number of white sharpeners) and x (the number of brown sharpeners).

You then used the information provided in the problem to formulate an equation: w(x + 1) + (18 - w)x = 100. You recognized that the equation could be simplified by combining like terms, resulting in 2x + w = 100.

Finally, you arrived at the correct answer, which is option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. Well done!

Here are some key takeaways from this problem:

1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key elements.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
3. Use logical reasoning to arrive at the solution.
4. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
5. Check your answer to ensure it satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Great job! Keep practicing, and you'll become a math whiz in no time.
