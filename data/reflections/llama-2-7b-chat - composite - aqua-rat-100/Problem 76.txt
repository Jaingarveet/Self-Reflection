Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the expression for x and determined the range of values for x based on the values of n. However, you made a small mistake in your calculation for n = 72.

Here's the correct calculation for n = 72:

x = (722 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4)
= (504 + 144 + 16) / (76 + 32 + 4)
= 1.29

So, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
