Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Profit margin calculation error
* Discount calculation error

Solution:
To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount, we need to use the formula:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit margin - Discount

First, let's calculate the profit margin:

Profit margin = 20% of Cost price = 20% x Rs. 1200 = Rs. 240

Now, we need to find the selling price that will give Karan a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit margin - Discount
= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 - 20% of Rs. 1200
= Rs. 1200 + Rs. 240 - Rs. 240
= Rs. 1200

So, the correct answer is (E) Rs. [REDACTED].
