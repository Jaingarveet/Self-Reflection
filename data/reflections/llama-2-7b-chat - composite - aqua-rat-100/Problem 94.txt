Explanation:
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to count the number of possible combinations.

Let's consider the letters of the alphabet as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and F. Each letter can be used once or twice, so there are 5 letters in total.

Now, let's count the number of possible combinations of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers:

* A[REDACTED]: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and E)
* A[REDACTED]: 3 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and F)
* A[REDACTED]: 3 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and E)
* A[REDACTED]: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and F)
* A[REDACTED]: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and F)
* AF: 1 combination ([REDACTED] and F)
* B[REDACTED]: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and E)
* B[REDACTED]: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and F)
* B[REDACTED]: 3 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and E)
* B[REDACTED]: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and F)
* B[REDACTED]: 3 combinations ([REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and F)
*BF: 2 combinations ([REDACTED] and F, [REDACTED] and E)

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is:

7 x 6 = 42

So, the answer is (D) [REDACTED].
