Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly set up the equation for the perimeter of the rectangle.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the equation
* Incorrect equation
* Calculation mistake

Solution:
The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides. The correct equation is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Since the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, we can set up the equation:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Now, we can substitute the value of Length in terms of [REDACTED]:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Perimeter = 2(4[REDACTED] + 1)

Perimeter = 8[REDACTED] + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is [REDACTED] (Answer: C).

Instructions:

1. Identify the dimensions of the rectangle.
2. Write the equation for the perimeter of a rectangle.
3. Use the given information to set up the equation for the length of the rectangle.
4. Solve the equation for the length.
5. Use the value of length to find the perimeter of the rectangle.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides.
