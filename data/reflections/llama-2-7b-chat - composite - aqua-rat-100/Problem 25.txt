Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the problem and the concept of angle of elevation.

The correct solution is:

The car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance traveled in 10 minutes is equal to the speed multiplied by the time.
The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so the height of the tower is increasing at a rate of 15° per 10 minutes.

The time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is 10 minutes.

So, the distance traveled by the car in this time is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 minutes x Speed

Speed = Distance / Time = 10 minutes / 10 minutes = 1

Now, the height of the tower is increasing at a rate of 15° per 10 minutes.
So, the height of the tower after 10 minutes is:
Height = 15° x 10 minutes = 150°

The angle of elevation at the base of the tower is 45°.
So, the height of the tower from the base is:
Height = Angle of elevation x Distance = 45° x 150° = 6750°

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower after 6750° / 1 = 6750 minutes = 109.4 hours = 4.5 days.

The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].
