Explanation:
You are correct that the sum of the ages of all the members of the club is [REDACTED]0, and that the ages are in [REDACTED].P. with a common difference of 3 months. However, your method of solving the problem is not correct.

You started by letting the age of the nth member be x, and then calculated the age of the (n+1)th member as x + 3. This is correct. However, you did not continue the calculation correctly. Instead of combining like terms, you wrote:

x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + [REDACTED]0) = [REDACTED]0

This is not the correct formula for an [REDACTED].P. The formula for an [REDACTED].P. is:

a1 + a2 + ... + an = n(n + 1)(n + 2)/6

You should have substituted the values:

a1 = x, a2 = x + 3, a3 = x + 6, ..., an = x + [REDACTED]0

And then solved for n.

So, the correct solution is:

n = [REDACTED]

Answer: B

However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. My apologies for the mistake. Thank you for pointing it out.
