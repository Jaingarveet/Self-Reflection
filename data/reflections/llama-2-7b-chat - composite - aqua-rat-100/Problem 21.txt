Explanation:
You have correctly identified the correct answer as option [REDACTED]. The product of the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day does indeed affect the total amount of work completed.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning behind each option:

A) [REDACTED]: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to [REDACTED]. However, as you pointed out, the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

B) [REDACTED]: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to [REDACTED]. However, as you also pointed out, the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

C) [REDACTED]: This option suggests that the work completed by y men working y hours per day is equal to [REDACTED]. This is the correct answer as the ratio of work completed does change with the number of workers.

D) [REDACTED]: This option suggests that the work completed by x men working x hours per day is equal to [REDACTED]. However, as you noted, the ratio of work completed does not change with the number of workers. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

E) [REDACTED]: This option is incorrect as at least one of the options (C) is the correct answer.
