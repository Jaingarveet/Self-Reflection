Solution:
To calculate the number of sales the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to know the commission percentage and the sale price.

Let's assume the commission percentage is 10% and the sale price is $[REDACTED]0.

The commission earned per sale is 10% of $[REDACTED]0, which is $[REDACTED].

To calculate the number of sales the salesperson must make, we can divide the desired salary of $1000 by the commission earned per sale:

$1000 รท $[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] sales

Therefore, the salesperson must make [REDACTED] sales of $[REDACTED]0 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

2. Calculate the commission earned per sale.
3. Divide the desired salary by the commission earned per sale to find the number of sales required.
