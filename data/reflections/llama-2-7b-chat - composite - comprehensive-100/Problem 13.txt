Explanation:

From the given conditions, we can conclude that if the team does not go to I Peak due to climate reasons, then they must have visited either Lake G or Lake J.

We can eliminate options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as they do not satisfy the given conditions. Option [REDACTED] is a possible scenario as the team can visit both G Lake and H Mountain if they don't go to I Peak. Option [REDACTED] is also a possible scenario as the team can go to F city and then visit G lake.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
