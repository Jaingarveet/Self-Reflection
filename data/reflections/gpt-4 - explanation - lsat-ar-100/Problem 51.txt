Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the fourth condition. I thought that Yuki could only test bicycle F on the first day, and Seamus had to test it on the second day. However, the condition actually states that whatever bicycle Yuki tests on the first day, Seamus must test on the second day.
