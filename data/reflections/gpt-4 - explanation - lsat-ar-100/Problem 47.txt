Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. I assumed that the voicemail target must be shorter than the website target, but the condition actually allows for the voicemail target to be the same as or shorter than the website target.
