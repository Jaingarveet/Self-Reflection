Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that we couldn't select another zoologist because we already had two. [REDACTED]owever, the condition states that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. In this case, only one botanist (F) is selected, so we can have more than one zoologist. 
Error [REDACTED]eywords:
- [REDACTED]isinterpretation of conditions
- Incorrect assumption
