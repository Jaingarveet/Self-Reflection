Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I incorrectly assumed that if Quinn and [REDACTED] were in the same zone, Parra and [REDACTED] would also be in the same zone. However, the conditions do not state that Parra and [REDACTED] cannot be in the same zone. The conditions only state that either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect.
