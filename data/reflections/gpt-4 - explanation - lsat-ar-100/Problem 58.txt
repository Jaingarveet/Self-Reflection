Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints given in the problem. I incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] could not be in bay 4 because it must be in a higher-numbered bay than [REDACTED]. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which cannot be in bay 4 because it must be in a higher-numbered bay than both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
