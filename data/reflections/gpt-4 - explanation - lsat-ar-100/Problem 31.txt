Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the third condition. I thought that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies had to be made on the same day, but the condition actually states that they are made on the same day. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED] and choose option [REDACTED].
