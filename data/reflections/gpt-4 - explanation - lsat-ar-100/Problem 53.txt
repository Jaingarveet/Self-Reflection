Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the sequence of the houses to be shown. I assumed that M must be shown in the afternoon because only two houses can be shown in the evening. However, I overlooked the fact that L must be shown after K and before M, which means L must be shown in the afternoon.
