Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that George must give the morning report on Tuesday because Kyle was giving the afternoon report. However, the conditions only state that George can only give a report on Tuesday, not that he must. This led me to eliminate all options that didn't have George reporting on Tuesday, which was a mistake.
