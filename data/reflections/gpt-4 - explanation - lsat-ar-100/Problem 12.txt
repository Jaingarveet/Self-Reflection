Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and the rules. I focused on the relationship between K, L, and M, and overlooked the rule that J must be shown in the evening. This rule implies that J cannot be shown consecutively with K, because K cannot be shown in the morning, and there are no consecutive slots in the evening.
