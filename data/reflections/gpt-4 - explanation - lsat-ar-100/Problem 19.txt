Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that Irving could give a report on Wednesday, but the conditions state that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Helen is giving a morning report, Nina cannot give a report because there is no next day for both Helen and Irving to give reports. This means Irving must give his report on Monday.
