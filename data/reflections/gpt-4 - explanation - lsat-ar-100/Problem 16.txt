Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the constraint that "Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's." I thought it meant that Julio must be scheduled before Olivia on the same day, not that Julio's session must be on a day before Olivia's session in the week.
