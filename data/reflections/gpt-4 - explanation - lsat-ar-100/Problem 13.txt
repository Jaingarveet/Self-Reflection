Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and made an incorrect assumption. I assumed that since Franco and Hong testify on the same day, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, they must testify on Tuesday. However, the question does not specify that Franco and Hong cannot testify on Wednesday. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Garcia must testify on Monday.
