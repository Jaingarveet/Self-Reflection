Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions given in the question. I failed to consider that if Y is fourth, then S, which must be earlier than Y, cannot be third because Q can only be third if S is earlier than Q. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED] and choose option [REDACTED].
