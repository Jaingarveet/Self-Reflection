Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy and the restaurant must be in spaces 7 and 1, respectively, which led me to conclude that the optometrist must be in space 6. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, not specifically which end. This led me to the incorrect conclusion that the optometrist is next to a restaurant.
