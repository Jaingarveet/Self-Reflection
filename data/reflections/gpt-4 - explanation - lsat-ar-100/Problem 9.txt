Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the rules. I thought that Young could not be assigned parking spaces #1 or #2, but the rules only state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Souza. Therefore, Young could be assigned parking space #2 if Togowa and Souza are assigned parking spaces #1. This misunderstanding led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED].
