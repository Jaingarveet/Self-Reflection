Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions and made an incorrect assumption. I assumed that if L and F were on the same shelf, then K and O must be on a higher shelf. However, the conditions only state that K must be on a higher shelf than F and O must be on a higher shelf than L. They do not necessarily have to be on the top shelf.
