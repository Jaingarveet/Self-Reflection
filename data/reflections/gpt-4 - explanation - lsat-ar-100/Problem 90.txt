Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the conditions. I focused on the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and concluded that [REDACTED] cannot be set for more than one client. However, I overlooked the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This condition implies that [REDACTED] cannot be set for more than one client because if it were, the corresponding voicemail target would have to be longer than 3 days, which is not possible.
