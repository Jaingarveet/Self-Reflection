Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy could not be in space 1 because the shoe store is in space 2. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, not that it cannot be next to any other business.
