Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I focused on the relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne, and overlooked the fact that Landon can only be assigned to Zambia. This means that no other candidate can be assigned to Zambia, making option [REDACTED] the correct answer.
