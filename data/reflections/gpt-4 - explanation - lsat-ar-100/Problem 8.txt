Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not fully consider the implications of the rule that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. This rule means that the bay holding livestock cannot be [REDACTED], because if it were, the bay holding textiles would have to be [REDACTED], and there would be no lower-numbered bay for the bay holding produce.
