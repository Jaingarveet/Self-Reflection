Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I focused on the condition that Reynaldo cannot test F and Yuki cannot test J, but I overlooked the condition that Theresa must be one of the testers for H. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Yuki cannot test F on the second day.
