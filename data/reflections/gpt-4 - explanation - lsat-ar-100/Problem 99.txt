Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that F must be performed either third or seventh based on the condition that T is performed immediately after R. However, I failed to consider that F could be performed [REDACTED] based on the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
