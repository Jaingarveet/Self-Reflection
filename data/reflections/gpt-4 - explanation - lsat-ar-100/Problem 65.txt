Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that only two zoologists could be selected if M was chosen. However, the condition states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, but it does not limit the selection to only P and R. Therefore, Q can also be selected, which makes option [REDACTED] the correct answer.
