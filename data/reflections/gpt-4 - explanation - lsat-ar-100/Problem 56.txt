Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Tiao could not be in Zone 1 or Zone 2, which led me to place Tiao in Zone 3. However, the conditions only state that Tiao cannot be in the same zone as Parra or Udall, not that Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
