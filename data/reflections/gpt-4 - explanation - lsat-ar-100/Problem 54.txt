Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that since Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Lopez and Megregian also do not review Tamerlane. However, the condition only states that Lopez and Megregian do not review any play that Jiang reviews, not that they cannot review Tamerlane if Jiang does not. This led me to the wrong conclusion.
