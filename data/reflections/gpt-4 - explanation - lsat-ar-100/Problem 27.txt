Explanation:
I misunderstood the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. I interpreted it as Megregian cannot review the same play as Kramer and O'Neill, which is incorrect. The condition only implies that Megregian reviews more plays, not necessarily different ones.
