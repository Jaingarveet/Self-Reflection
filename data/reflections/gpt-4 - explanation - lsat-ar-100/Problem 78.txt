Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. I interpreted this as Helen and Irving must give their reports on the same day, which is not necessarily true. They just need to give their reports after Nina, not necessarily on the same day.
