Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the constraints on when Nina could give her report. I incorrectly concluded that Nina must give her report on Tuesday, which led me to eliminate the correct answer choice. My reasoning was flawed because I did not consider all possible scenarios that fit the given conditions.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis of constraints
 - Prematurely eliminating valid scenarios
 - Incorrect deduction
Solution:
1. George must give his report on Tuesday, as that is the only day he can do so.
2. Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give his report on either Monday morning or Wednesday morning.
3. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. This is possible because George's report could be in the morning and Helen and Irving's reports could be in the afternoon.
4. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports, as George is already giving his report on Tuesday.
5. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports, as the condition only applies if Nina's report is not on Wednesday.
6. Therefore, Nina could give her report on either Monday or Wednesday.
7. If Nina gives her report on Monday and Robert gives his on Wednesday, then Helen could give her report on Wednesday as well. This matches answer choice A.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints multiple times.
2. Identify the fixed constraints (e.g., George's report must be on Tuesday).
3. Consider each person mentioned in the question and the constraints on when they can give their report.
4. Methodically consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
5. Do not prematurely eliminate any scenarios unless they clearly violate a constraint.
6. Check each answer choice against the possible scenarios to find one that could be true.
Advice:
 - Always fully analyze the constraints before drawing conclusions.
 - Consider all possible scenarios, even if some seem less likely.
 - Don't make unwarranted assumptions or logical leaps.
 - Eliminate answer choices only when they clearly violate a stated constraint.
 - If you're unsure, create a list or diagram to keep track of the possibilities.
 - Remember that "could be true" questions only require one valid scenario, not the only scenario.
