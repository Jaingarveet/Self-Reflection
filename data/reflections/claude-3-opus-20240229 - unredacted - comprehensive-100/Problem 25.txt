Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all of the remaining answer choices (A, B, and E) satisfied the given constraints. However, I overlooked that in choices A and B, the toy store is adjacent to the veterinarian, violating the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Only choice E satisfies all of the given constraints.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking constraints
 - Incomplete verification
 - Hasty generalization
 - Attention to detail
Solution:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end. This eliminates choice D.
2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. In choice E, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. This constraint is satisfied.
3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. In choice E, the restaurants are separated by the toy store, optometrist, and shoe store. This constraint is satisfied.
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. In choice E, the toy store is separated from the veterinarian by the optometrist. This constraint is satisfied.
5. Choice E satisfies all the given constraints and is the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints.
2. Evaluate each answer choice one by one.
3. For each answer choice, verify that it satisfies each constraint.
4. If an answer choice violates any constraint, eliminate it.
5. If an answer choice satisfies all constraints, it could be the correct answer.
6. After evaluating all answer choices, select the one that satisfies all constraints.
7. Double-check your selected answer to ensure it indeed satisfies all constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints before attempting to solve the problem.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice individually and systematically.
 - Never assume an answer choice is correct without verifying it satisfies all constraints.
 - Always pay close attention to the details in each answer choice.
 - If an answer choice violates any single constraint, it cannot be the correct answer, even if it satisfies other constraints.
 - Always double-check your selected answer to ensure your reasoning is correct.
