Explanation:
I focused too much on the variability in allergic reactions between individuals, and not enough on the variability in the proteins produced by different cats. While the passage does strongly support that no cat causes allergies in all people, upon re-reading, it also directly states that the particular proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person. This implies that cats must differ in the specific proteins they produce.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of key information
 - Overlooking directly stated facts
 - Overemphasis on tangential points
 - Insufficient re-evaluation of all answer choices
Solution:
The passage states: "which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer." 
This directly implies that cats produce different allergy-causing proteins.
If all cats produced the exact same proteins, the proteins causing an individual's allergies would not vary.
Therefore, not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins in their skin secretions and saliva.
While the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone, this implication about protein variability in cats is more direct.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully, noting all directly stated facts.
2. Identify the key pieces of information, ignoring tangential points.
3. Analyze each answer choice in light of the key information.
4. Determine which choice is most directly supported by the facts as stated.
5. Re-read the passage to confirm your selected answer is fully supported.
6. If multiple choices seem supported, determine which has the strongest and most direct support.
7. Do not infer beyond what is directly implied by the stated information.
Advice:
 - Always read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.
 - Focus on the facts directly stated, not just the implications you draw.
 - Be careful not to overemphasize tangential or less relevant information.
 - Always re-evaluate all the choices after your initial selection.
 - The correct answer will be strongly and directly supported, not just potentially inferred.
 - Avoid making assumptions beyond what is clearly implied by the passage.
 - Remember that the question asks what is most supported, not just possibly true.
