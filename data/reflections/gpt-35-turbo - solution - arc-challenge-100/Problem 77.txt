Solution:
The sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns. When a new predator is introduced, the sheep with light wool are more likely to be targeted and killed, which will result in a decrease in their population.
