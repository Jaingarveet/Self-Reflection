Explanation:
The question is asking for evidence to support the idea that the base pairing in DN[REDACTED] is complementary, specifically that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.

The table shows the percentage of each base in various organisms' DN[REDACTED], including sea urchin DN[REDACTED].

To find evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, we need to look for a pair of bases that have a high percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DN[REDACTED].

The highest percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DN[REDACTED] is between adenine and thymine, with 17.3% and 17.7% respectively. This suggests that adenine and thymine are paired together in sea urchin DN[REDACTED], which supports the idea of complementary base pairing.

Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Error:
You did not provide your answer in the correct format.
Your answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")';
where [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice.

In this case, the correct answer choice is [REDACTED], so the correct format for your answer would be:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
