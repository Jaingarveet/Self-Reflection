Explanation:

In Passage 1, Beveridge presents liberty as a noble ideal that has been bestowed upon the United States by God and emphasizes the country's destiny to spread this liberty to other regions through imperial expansion. On the other hand, in Passage 2, Bryan argues that the principles of self-government and popular sovereignty, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, should not be repudiated in the Philippines or elsewhere. Bryan sees liberty as a fundamental right that all people possess and warns against the negative consequences of imperialism on both the colonized people and the United States itself.

Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best choice, as it accurately describes the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty. Beveridge sees liberty as something that can be exported through conquest, while Bryan sees it as a fundamental right that should not be compromised through imperial expansion.
