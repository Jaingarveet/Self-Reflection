Explanation:
The author of Passage 2, Mary Wollstonecraft, argues that women are excluded from political rights and functions, and that this exclusion is unjust and inconsistent with the principles of reason and happiness. She claims that men have usurped the throne of reason and tyrannize over women, denying them civil and political rights and forcing them to remain immured in their families. Therefore, the author's claim is that the freedom granted by society's leaders has privileged one gender over the other, which is choice [REDACTED].
