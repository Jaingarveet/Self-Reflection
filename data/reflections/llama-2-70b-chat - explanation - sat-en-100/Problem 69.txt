Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the passages and their authors' views on women's roles and responsibilities.

Both passages suggest that women have important moral duties and responsibilities, and that their ethical obligations are often undervalued. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
