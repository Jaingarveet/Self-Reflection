Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beveridge describes the United States as "a land set like a sentinel between the two imperial oceans of the globe" and notes that it is "a greater England with a nobler destiny." He also emphasizes that the United States has been "planted on this soil" by God and that it is "a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes." These statements suggest that Beveridge views the resources and immensity of the United States as a divine gift to the American people, rather than a safeguard against foreign invasion (choice A), a replication of conditions in Europe (choice B), or a source of envy for people in other countries (choice D). Therefore, the best answer is choice [REDACTED].
