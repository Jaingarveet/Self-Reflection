Explanation:
The passage states that the Venus flytrap needs to conserve its energy supply, as closing its trap requires a significant amount of energy and reopening it can take several hours. The plant achieves this by requiring multiple triggers (the touch of two hairs) to spring the trap closed, which ensures that it only closes when a large enough insect is present, making it worth the energy expenditure. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the plant identifying the species of its prey.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while calcium is involved in the mechanism of the Venus flytrap's closure, the passage does not suggest that the plant's calcium reserves are a concern.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while the plant does need to wait for a second trigger before closing, this is not done to prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey, but rather to ensure that it only closes when a large enough insect is present.
