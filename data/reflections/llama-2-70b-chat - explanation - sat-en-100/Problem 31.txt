Explanation:
The passage states that the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe, and that the birds carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. It does not provide any information about the ibises' familiarity with migration routes or data loggers, nor does it mention any specific similarity between the ibises' body design and that of modern airplanes. Therefore, the most reasonable inference that can be made about Usherwood's choice of subjects is that the ibises were easily accessible for him and his team to track and observe, given their involvement in the reintroduction project.
