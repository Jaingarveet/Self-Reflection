Explanation:
The passage contrasts Eppie, Silas's daughter, with his gold. While the gold is described as "dead," "deaf," and "blind," Eppie is portrayed as a "creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires," seeking sunshine, living sounds, and human kindness. She is described as "compacted of changes and hopes" that carry Silas's thoughts away from his old, repetitive pacing and towards new things. Therefore, option [REDACTED], vitality, is the best answer.
