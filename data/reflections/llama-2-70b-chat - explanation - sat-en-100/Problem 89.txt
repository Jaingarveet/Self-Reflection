Explanation:
In Passage 2, Bryan argues that the desire for self-government is a fundamental aspect of human nature. He states that God has placed the love of liberty in every human heart, and that no race of people is so low in civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master. This suggests that the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule is an innate drive in humans, rather than a reaction to imperial governments, a sign of belief in human equality, or a testament to the effects of US foreign policy. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
