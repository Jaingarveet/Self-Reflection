Explanation:
The passage begins by describing the Alcazar Restaurant and its patrons, including Lymie, who is reading a book while eating. The focus then shifts to Lymie's experience reading about the Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna, with the text providing details about the historical events and the marginal notes in the book. The focus then shifts again to the people in the restaurant, particularly a group of four who enter and take a table near Lymie. The passage ends with Mr. Peters, Lymie's father, entering the restaurant and joining Lymie at his table.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: Lymie's experience reading a book to descriptions of people in the restaurant. The primary focus of the passage shifts from Lymie's inner thoughts and experience reading about historical events to descriptions of the people and atmosphere in the restaurant.
