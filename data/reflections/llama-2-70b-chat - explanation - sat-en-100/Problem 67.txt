Explanation:
The passage suggests that Silas' adoption of Eppie has led him to look forward to a different kind of future. Before Eppie came into his life, Silas was described as being trapped in a "cold, narrow prison" of his own thoughts and obsessed with his gold. In contrast, Eppie represents new life, hope, and change, and her presence has awakened Silas to the world around him. Now, he looks forward to the future with anticipation, eager to see what Eppie will learn and do next. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
