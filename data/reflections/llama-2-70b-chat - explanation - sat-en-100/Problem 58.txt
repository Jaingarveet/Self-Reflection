Explanation:
The authors assume that clover does not produce pyrethrums, as they suggest offering pyrethrum-producing plants to commercial honey bee colonies as a treatment to prevent mite infestations. If clover did produce pyrethrums, it would not be necessary to offer separate pyrethrum-producing plants, and the study would not be able to test the effectiveness of pyrethrums in preventing mite infestations. Therefore, assumption [REDACTED] is an unstated assumption made by the authors about clover.
