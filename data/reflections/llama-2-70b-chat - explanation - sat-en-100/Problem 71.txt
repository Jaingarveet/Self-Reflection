Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect because women exert their influence within the home and family life. Beecher argues that women are designed to have a subordinate relation in society to men, but this does not mean that their duties or influence should be any less important. Instead, women are to win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved, and thus exerting their influence in the domestic and social circle. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
