Explanation:
I chose option [REDACTED], which is not the best question to the blogger's conclusion. Option [REDACTED] is about the quality of the objections, not the representativeness of the sample. The best question to the blogger's conclusion is about the representativeness of the sample. Option [REDACTED] is the best question because it challenges the assumption that most people who follow this blogger's article are their loyal fans. If most of the followers are loyal fans, then the sample may not be representative of the general population, and the conclusion may not be valid.
