Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and made an incorrect conclusion. 
I thought that since Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, Yinling Station must be on the east side of Haoyun Station. 
However, the question only states that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, but it does not provide any information about the location of Yinling Station. 
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: Hu Yao is standing on the east side.
