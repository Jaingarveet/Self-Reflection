Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the celebrity had to choose between two bad options. 
Option [REDACTED] is the only option that must be true based on the information given in the stem. 
Option [REDACTED] is contradicted by the fact that the stem presents the celebrity as being in an awkward situation due to the gossip news. 
Option [REDACTED] is a possible strategy but not necessarily the best one. 
Option [REDACTED] is not mentioned in the stem.
