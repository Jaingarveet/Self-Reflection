Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not carefully read and analyze each option. 
Option [REDACTED] is not a contradiction to the official's argument, but rather a similar statement that supports the idea that low-income earners should also be recognized as taxpayers. 
Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it raises doubts about the official's argument by suggesting that China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes, not personal income tax. Therefore, the argument that a high starting point for personal income tax will deprive low-income earners of the honor of being the most taxpayers may not be valid in the context of China's tax system.
