Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the requirements. 
I only considered the requirement that [REDACTED] cannot be selected with [REDACTED]. 
However, there is another requirement that Guo Yanran and [REDACTED] cannot be selected at the same time. 
Therefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. 
Since [REDACTED] cannot be selected, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
