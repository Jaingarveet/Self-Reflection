Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all the possible combinations of departments that F and M could be in charge of. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because if F and M are in different departments, then F and I cannot be in the same department, and I and P cannot be in the same department. Therefore, I and P must be in the same department.
