Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering the contrapositive of the conditional statement. 
If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%. 
The contrapositive of this statement is: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, then it cannot increase productivity by 10%. 
Therefore, if Green Island does not increase productivity by 10%, it does not necessarily mean it will go bankrupt. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because if Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
