Explanation:
I incorrectly derived that being careful and meticulous means a person has no taste. This is not supported by the passage. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because the passage states that in a solid cultural environment, people are not overbearing and have good morality. However, being careful and meticulous does not necessarily mean a person has good morality. Therefore, it cannot be derived that if a person is immoral, he is overbearing and careful.
