Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option [REDACTED] as the most similar argument. 
Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it presents a similar conditional statement: anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Then, it applies the negation of the consequent to Sun Wen, concluding that Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
