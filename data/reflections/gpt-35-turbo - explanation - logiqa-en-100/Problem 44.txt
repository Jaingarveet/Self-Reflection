Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the loophole in the argument. 
The argument assumes that installing an airbag in a car does not make the car owner safer because the proportion of cars with airbags in car accidents is higher than that of cars without airbags. However, this argument ignores the possibility that the severity of injuries in accidents involving cars with airbags is lower than that of cars without airbags.
