Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the answer because it mentions buying stocks or funds, which is a possible alternative investment option. However, the passage does not mention anything about buying stocks or funds. Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it mentions that private lending is active and the interest on lending is much higher than the bank deposit interest rate. This suggests that residents may be withdrawing their savings from banks and investing in private lending to earn higher interest rates.
