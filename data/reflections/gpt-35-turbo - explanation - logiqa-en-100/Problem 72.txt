Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer [REDACTED] because I misinterpreted Liu Xiang's statement. 
Liu Xiang's victory and words suggest that he believes yellow-skinned athletes can also be champions in track and field.
However, his statements do not directly address the assertion that most track and field champions are black athletes.
