Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the logic of the statements. 
I assumed that a company with dividends cannot issue new stocks, but the statement says that only companies with dividends can issue new stocks. 
Therefore, if a company does not have dividends, it cannot issue new stocks.
