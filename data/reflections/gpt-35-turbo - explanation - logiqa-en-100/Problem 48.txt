Explanation:
I chose the wrong answer because I did not carefully read and analyze each option. 
Option [REDACTED] provides an alternative explanation for the increase in transaction volume, but it does not directly argue against the claim that more and more rich people in China are transferring their property abroad.
The best argument against the above argument is option B, which suggests that the increase in transaction volume may be due to factors other than wealthy Chinese transferring their property abroad, such as Chinese companies investing in US real estate or Chinese students studying in the US buying property.
