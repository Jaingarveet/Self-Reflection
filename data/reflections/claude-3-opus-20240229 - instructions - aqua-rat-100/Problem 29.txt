Instructions:
1. Identify the total distance the frog needs to travel (well depth).
2. Calculate the effective distance the frog travels each day (distance up - distance down).
3. Determine the number of days needed to reach just below the top (total distance / effective daily distance).
4. Add one more day for the frog to jump out of the well.
5. The total number of days is the number of days to reach just below the top + 1.
