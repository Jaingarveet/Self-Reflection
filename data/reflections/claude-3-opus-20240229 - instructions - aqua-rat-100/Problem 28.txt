Instructions:
1. Identify the events and their probabilities from the problem statement.
2. Determine if the events are stated to be independent or not.
3. If events are not stated to be independent, consider the possibility that they are dependent.
4. Use the appropriate probability rules (addition rule, multiplication rule) based on the independence of the events.
5. If a probability is unknown, consider the range of possible values it could take.
6. Calculate the desired probability, considering the range of possible values for any unknown probabilities.
7. If the calculated probability is outside the possible range (e.g., negative), adjust it to the nearest possible value.
8. Select the answer choice that matches the calculated probability, considering any adjustments made.
