Instructions:
1. Count the total number of letters in the word.
2. Determine if the question is asking about permutations with or without repetition.
3. If the question asks about permutations without repetition (i.e., all letters are considered distinct), then the number of permutations is simply n!, where n is the total number of letters.
4. If the question asks about permutations with repetition, then you need to divide n! by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each repeated element.
5. Select the answer choice that matches your calculated result.
