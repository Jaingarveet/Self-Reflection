Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully, noting the order of points on the circle.
2. If one arc bisects another, calculate the measure of the resulting arcs.
3. Use the fact that the sum of the measures of a minor arc and major arc is 360Â°.
4. Visualize the circle and the position of the points to understand their relationships.
5. To find the measure of an arc between two points, add or subtract the measures of known arcs as appropriate based on the position of the points.
6. Double-check your calculations.
7. Select the answer choice that matches your calculated result.
