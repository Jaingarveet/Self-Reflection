Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
2. Calculate the speed of the shuttle using the given distance and time.
3. Understand what it means for the shuttle to "pass a point" in the context of the problem.
4. Calculate the distance the shuttle travels in the time it takes to pass the point.
5. Recognize that this distance includes both the length of the shuttle and the point.
6. Make a reasonable assumption about the length of the point if not given.
7. Approximate the length of the shuttle based on the calculated distance.
8. Choose the answer choice closest to your approximation.
