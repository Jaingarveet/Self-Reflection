Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
 - Make a list of all the constraints.
 - Use the constraints to eliminate any options that do not satisfy them.
 - Double-check that all the constraints are satisfied by the chosen option.
 - If you miss a constraint, start over and read the problem again.
