Solution:
The data in the table show the percent of colonies affected by each pathogen for colonies with colony collapse disorder and colonies without colony collapse disorder.
The data do not provide information about whether the honeybees had been infected with mites.
Therefore, the data do not provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
