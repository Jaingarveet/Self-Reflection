Solution:
The passage states that the pilot experiments were conducted without planting any crops to avoid competition with the emerging weeds. 
Therefore, the presence of crops would likely have affected the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds. 
Planting crops would have introduced competition for resources, such as sunlight and nutrients, which could have reduced the growth of weeds.
