Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The question asks which option does not help explain the gap between the statistics in the question and the people's feelings. The correct answer is [REDACTED], because it does not address the issue of why people might perceive price increases differently than what is reflected in the CPI statistics.

Option [REDACTED] suggests that high-income groups may not perceive small price increases as significant, which could contribute to a gap between the official statistics and people's feelings. However, this option does not directly address the issue of why people might perceive price increases differently than what is reflected in the CPI statistics.

Option [REDACTED], on the other hand, suggests that the CPI statistical range and standards used in China were formulated over 20 years ago and may not accurately reflect current trends in consumer prices. This could contribute to a gap between the official statistics and people's perceptions of price increases.

Option [REDACTED] states that the CPI published by the National Bureau of Statistics is a data description of the overall situation of prices of various goods and services across the country, and it cannot fully reflect individual feelings and regional differences. This option also acknowledges a potential gap between the statistics and people's perceptions.

Option [REDACTED] does not help explain the gap between the statistics in the question and the people's feelings, as it only suggests that products with a high degree of relevance to people's lives tend to increase in price, while those with a low degree of relevance tend to fall in price.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
