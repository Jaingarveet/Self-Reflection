Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and selection.
I incorrectly assumed that the coach must select one of E or F, one of J or K, and either G or M.
However, the conditions allow for the possibility that E and F are not selected, and J and K are not selected.
The correct solution is to select [REDACTED], as they are the only two players who meet the conditions of the problem.
