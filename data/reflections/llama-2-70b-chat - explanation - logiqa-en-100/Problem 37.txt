Explanation:
The statement "Huaizhou City will certainly encounter the problems of stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment" is best supported by the given information. The city's development depends on industry, which provides jobs and wages for residents but also produces pollution that threatens the natural environment. This interconnection between economic growth and environmental quality means that if the city's industry, which is the backbone of its economy, inevitably produces pollution, it is likely that the city will face problems such as stagnation of economic development or deterioration of the natural environment.
