Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning by not considering all possible scenarios.
I incorrectly assumed that X and F must be in the same department, which led me to eliminate options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
However, I failed to notice that X and F could be in different departments, which would satisfy all the conditions.
