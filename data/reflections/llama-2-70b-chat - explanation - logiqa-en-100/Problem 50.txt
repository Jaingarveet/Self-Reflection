Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the rules provided. 
I thought that when valve No. 1 was opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 4 must be opened. 
However, the rules state that when valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 must be opened, and valve No. 5 must be closed. 
Therefore, when valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 3 must be opened, as valve No. 5 is closed.
