Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between crocodiles and seals, and their respective food sources. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This answer choice weakens the argument that seals caused the reduction of crocodiles, as both species share a common food source.
It suggests that the decline in crocodile population may be due to other factors, such as environmental changes or overfishing of capelin, rather than competition with seals.
