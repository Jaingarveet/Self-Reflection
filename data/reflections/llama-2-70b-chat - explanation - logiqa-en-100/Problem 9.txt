Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the given conditions.
I thought that Condition 5 required that at least one employee must be in both groups, but it actually states that at least one of the same employees in both groups must be replaced.
Therefore, K cannot replace [REDACTED] in either group, as that would violate Condition 5.
