Explanation:
The statement that during the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere was much higher than it is today, and there were many giant insects on earth, supports the argument that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects. This is because it suggests that when oxygen levels were higher, larger insects were able to exist, whereas at current oxygen levels, the total length of the stomata system has reached its limit, suggesting that larger insects cannot survive. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] provides evidence that oxygen levels can impact the size of insects, supporting the argument.
