Explanation:
The argument states that great painters often spend most of their time in loneliness and have no intimate relationships, yet they still manage to produce great art. This suggests that loneliness may not be a necessary condition for their artistic success, and that they can still achieve great things despite their lack of intimate relationships. This contradicts the psychological theory that maintaining intimate relationships is necessary for happiness. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
