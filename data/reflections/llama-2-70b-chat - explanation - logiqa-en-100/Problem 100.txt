Explanation:
The given question is a classic logic puzzle that involves satisfying certain conditions by arranging a set of elements in a particular order. In this case, the elements are the seven magicians - G, H, K, L, N, P, and Q - and the conditions are:

1. G or H must be in the front if they are playing.
2. K must be in the middle.
3. L must be on team 1.
4. P and K cannot be on the same team as N.
5. P and Q cannot be on the same team.
6. If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.

The question asks for the acceptable arrangement for team 1 if H is in team 2. The correct answer is choice [REDACTED]:

* Before: L (condition 3)
* Middle: Q (condition 6)
* After: G (condition 1)

In this arrangement, K is in the middle of team 2, which satisfies condition 2. P is not on the same team as N or Q, which satisfies conditions 4 and 5. H is in team 2, which satisfies condition 6. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the only acceptable arrangement for team 1 if H is in team 2.
