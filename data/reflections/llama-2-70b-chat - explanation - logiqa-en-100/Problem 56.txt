Explanation:
The best answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

This answer raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view because it suggests that the current bridge height is not the only factor limiting the size of ships that can pass through the Yangtze River. The fact that 8000-ton ships have successfully passed through Nanjing to Wuhan indicates that the current bridge height is not a significant barrier to navigation. Additionally, the development of shipbuilding technology may have created new opportunities for designing ships that can navigate the Yangtze River without requiring a higher bridge clearance. Therefore, the expert's claim that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt may not be entirely accurate.
