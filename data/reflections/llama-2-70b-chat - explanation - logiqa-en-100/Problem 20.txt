Explanation:
The argument relies on the assumption that primary school reading is a symbol of a country and nation maintaining cultural classics and traditions. The author suggests that China has lost its cultural classics and traditions because elementary school students no longer read the Bible or swear according to the Analects. This implies that the author believes that reading classic texts and reciting oaths are essential symbols of a nation's cultural heritage, and that a lack of these practices indicates a loss of cultural classics and traditions. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
