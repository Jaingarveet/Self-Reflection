Solution:
The text encourages independent thinking and decision-making, which is a core aspect of an indie persona. 
While choice A discusses understanding the influence of others on trends, it does not emphasize forming one's opinions, which is crucial to the text's message. 
Choice B completes the text effectively by encouraging readers to do their research to inform their opinions, even if those opinions go against the grain. 
This aligns with the text's message of evaluating situations independently and making decisions free from conformity.
