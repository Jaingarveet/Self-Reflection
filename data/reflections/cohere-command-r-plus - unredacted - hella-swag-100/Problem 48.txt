Explanation:
I failed to consider the context and the logical progression of the text. The correct answer continues the discussion on speaker types for different use cases, specifically mentioning "standing speakers" and "surround sound systems" as upgrades for a more intensive experience. 

Error Keywords:
- Context misunderstanding

Solution:
The text is a guide on how to shop for speakers, suggesting that the first step is to decide how the speakers will be used. It mentions bookshelf speakers for casual music listening.
