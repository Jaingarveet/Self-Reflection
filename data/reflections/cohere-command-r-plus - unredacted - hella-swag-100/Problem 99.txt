Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the context and the flow of the text. I focused on the technical aspect of modem installation, while the correct answer choice ("B") addresses the compatibility issue raised in the previous sentence. My error was a result of not fully grasping the main issue presented in the text.
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Context misunderstanding
- Flow prediction mistake
Solution: 
The text discusses the potential compatibility issues between modems and specific internet companies. It advises checking compatibility before purchasing a modem. The correct answer choice ("B") is a logical continuation of this topic. It suggests a course of action if compatibility issues arise: exchanging the modem or switching the internet subscription.
Instructions:
1. Understand the structure of the text: header, title, and substeps.
2. Identify the main issue presented: potential compatibility problems between modems and internet companies.
3. Recognize that the correct answer choice should address this issue directly.
4. Evaluate each choice:
   - Choice "A" discusses installation during an active subscription, which is irrelevant to the compatibility issue.
   - Choice "B" offers solutions if compatibility issues arise, aligning with the main topic.
   - Choice "C" introduces irrelevant options of buying individual components separately.
   - Choice "D" shifts the focus to modem defects, which is unrelated to the compatibility discussion.
5. Select choice "B" as the most logical and relevant completion to the text.
