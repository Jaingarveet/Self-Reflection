Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
I mistakenly thought that the conclusion "friends are like dung" was a direct result of the premises, and therefore, the false conclusion implied that the premises were false.
However, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which states that if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
This answer choice recognizes that the premise "Money is like dung" is false, but it does not lead to the conclusion that "friends are like dung."
Instead, it suggests that the premise "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" is true, but the conclusion "friends are like dung" is false.
