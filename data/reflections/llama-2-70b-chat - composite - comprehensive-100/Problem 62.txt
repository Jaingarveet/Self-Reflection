Explanation:
I incorrectly solved the system of equations by substitution. 
I made a mistake in expanding and simplifying the equation.
Error Keywords:
- Substitution error
- Expansion error
- Simplification error

Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination.
By substitution, we have:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$3x + 4(2y - x) = -23$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$3x + 8y - 4x = -23$$
$$-x + 8y = -27$$
Solving for x and y, we get:
$$x = 3$$
$$y = -8$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(3, -8)$.

Instructions:
1. Write the first equation.
2. Write the second equation.
3. Substitute the second equation into the first equation.
4. Expand and simplify.
5. Solve for x and y.
6. Check your solution.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- When solving systems of equations by substitution, be careful when expanding and simplifying the equation.
