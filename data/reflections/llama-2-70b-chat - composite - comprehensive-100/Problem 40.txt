Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED], because it provides an alternative explanation for Carl's low success rate in solving crimes. If the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective and assigns him only the most difficult cases that others have failed to solve, then it's possible that Carl's low success rate is not due to his incompetence, but rather due to the difficulty of the cases he's been assigned. This weakens the argument that Carl is an incompetent detective.
