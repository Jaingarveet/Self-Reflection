Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that hydroxylysine is an amino acid that undergoes the typical process of aminoacyl t-RNA-mediated charging onto tRN[REDACTED] molecules during protein translation. However, hydroxylysine is a product of post-translational modification and is not directly incorporated into proteins during translation.
