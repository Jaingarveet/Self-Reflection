Explanation:
I incorrectly answered this question because I associated *P. falciparum* with falciparum malaria, which is indeed correct, but I failed to recognize that falciparum malaria primarily infects young RBCs, not senescent ones. My mistake was in not understanding the specific life cycle and tropism of the *P. falciparum* parasite.
