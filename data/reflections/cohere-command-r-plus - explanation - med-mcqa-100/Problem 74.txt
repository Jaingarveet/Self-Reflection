Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the vagus nerve as the primary nerve involved in swallowing and aspiration. While the vagus nerve does play a role in these functions, the correct answer is the Superior Laryngeal Nerve (SLN), a branch of the vagus nerve, which is specifically responsible for controlling the constriction of the vocal cords during swallowing and preventing aspiration. My error was in not considering the specific branches and functions of the vagus nerve.
