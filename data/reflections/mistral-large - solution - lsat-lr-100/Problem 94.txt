The original argument assumes that all auto mechanics have extensive experience and that all mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. However, this does not necessarily mean that all auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is an example of the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.
Choice [REDACTED] assumes that all snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer and that all companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. However, this does not necessarily mean that all snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. This is also an example of the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.
