Solution:
Patricia's argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas.
Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the wealthy were not representative of the general population.
Choice [REDACTED] is the strongest counter because it shows that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which weakens Tamara's argument that many Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.
