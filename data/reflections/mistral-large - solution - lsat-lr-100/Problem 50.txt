Solution:
The finding of the nicotine study is that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
This suggests that there is a physiological limit to the amount of nicotine that can be absorbed by the blood.
Choice [REDACTED] states that blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available, which explains why the levels of nicotine in the blood are identical at the end of the day.
