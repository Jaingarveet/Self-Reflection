Solution:
The argument assumes that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights. However, this assumption could be flawed if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are.

To evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know [REDACTED] (choice E). If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then it would be more likely that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. However, if residents of Flynn Heights are not more likely to license their dogs, then the argument is weaker.
