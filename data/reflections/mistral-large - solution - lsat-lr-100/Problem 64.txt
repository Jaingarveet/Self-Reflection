Solution:
The argument assumes that the presence of hormones in tears is the cause of the reduction of emotional stress.
However, the argument does not provide evidence to support this assumption.
The argument takes for granted that because certain substances (hormones) are present whenever a condition (crying) occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition (reduction of emotional stress).
