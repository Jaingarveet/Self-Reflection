Solution:
Morgenstern's argument assumes that the only risk involved in quitting a job is not finding another one.
However, this assumption [REDACTED].
Brooks may be unhappy in his current job, but quitting may lead to a different type of unhappiness that is more significant or intense.
Therefore, Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it fails to consider the possibility that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance.
