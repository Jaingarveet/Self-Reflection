Solution:
The ethicist's conclusion is that "love" in the context of marital vows should not be taken to refer to feelings.
The ethicist's argument is that feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense.
For this conclusion to follow logically, it must be assumed that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
