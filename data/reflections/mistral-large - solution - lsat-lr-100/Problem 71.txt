Solution:
The curator's statements indicate that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. Therefore, there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
