Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the fact that the defendant's noncompliance with national codes cannot be excused by confusion with local codes.
The principle that justifies this reasoning is that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
This means that if the defendant was required to comply with national codes, then he was also required to comply with local codes, and his confusion between the two is irrelevant.
