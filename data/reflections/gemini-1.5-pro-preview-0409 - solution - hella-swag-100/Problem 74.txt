While I cannot access the original text due to safety restrictions, I can still analyze the answer choices and select the most likely completion based on common sense and the context provided.
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option focuses on personal experimentation and finding a style that suits the individual. While this is a valid approach to personal style, it doesn't directly address the initial statement about two types of "sexy."
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option builds upon the initial statement by suggesting that different types of "sexy" can be used strategically to attract different types of partners. This aligns with the idea of "traditional" vs. "down-to-earth" attractiveness and provides a practical application of the concept.
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option introduces the concept of dress codes and regional preferences, which is not directly related to the initial statement about types of "sexy."
*   **Choice [REDACTED]:** This option seems to elaborate on the "Jessica Rabbit" type of "sexy" but does so in a way that might be considered stereotypical or objectifying. 
Based on this analysis, **Choice B** appears to be the most logical and contextually relevant completion to the given text.
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
