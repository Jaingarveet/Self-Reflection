Explanation:
Upon re-reading the paragraph, I realize that my initial interpretation was incorrect. The paragraph is not primarily questioning Akira's suggestion, but rather analyzing Chie's reaction to it.
The key phrases are "Was that it?" and "would Chie have been more receptive?" which indicate that the paragraph is focused on understanding Chie's reaction, and whether it would have been different if Akira had followed tradition.
