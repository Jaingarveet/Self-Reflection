Explanation:
I misread the data in the table. I looked at the "Colonies without colony collapse disorder" column, but I chose the pathogen with the highest percentage in that column ([REDACTED] at 81%). However, the question asked about colonies without colony collapse disorder, so I should have looked at the "Colonies with colony collapse disorder" column instead.
