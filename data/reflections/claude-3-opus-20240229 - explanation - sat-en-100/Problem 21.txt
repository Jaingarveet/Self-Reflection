Explanation:
I misinterpreted the main point of the passage. While the passage does mention territorial expansion, its central argument is that the current Constitutional structure, allowing for both free and slave states, is fundamentally sound and does not need to be altered. The author is directly refuting Lincoln's claim that a nation divided into free and slave states "cannot stand."
