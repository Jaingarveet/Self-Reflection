Solution:
The argument is that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery because they have instituted identical penalties for both crimes. To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is indeed equal to the harm resulting from bribery. 
Option [REDACTED] provides evidence that supports the idea that lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes. If lawmakers believe that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery, then it makes sense for them to institute identical penalties for both crimes.
