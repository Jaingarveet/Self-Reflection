Solution:
The argument claims that technological innovation is rarely in the interest of society as a whole because those responsible for it are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. This assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is not necessarily true, as people may unintentionally produce outcomes that they did not desire.
