Solution:
The statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton is used to explain the importance of phytoplankton in the food chain. 
The argument explains how global warming affects the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton, which in turn affects the food chain. 
Since zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton, the decline in phytoplankton populations will eventually lead to declines in zooplankton populations and the rest of the food chain. 
Therefore, the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly.
