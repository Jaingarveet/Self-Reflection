Solution:
The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Therefore, prints of works that are displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector are available in the museum store.
