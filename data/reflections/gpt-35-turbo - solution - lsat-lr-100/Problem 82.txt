Solution:
Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house. To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to provide evidence that the squeaky floors were not necessarily due to fear of ninjas. Answer [REDACTED] is the strongest counter because it points out that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which means that the majority of Japanese did not fear ninjas.
