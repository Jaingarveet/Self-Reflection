Solution:
Mike is trying to justify his use of Tom's computer without his permission by citing Tom's use of Mary's bicycle without her permission. The principle that would most help to justify Mike's reasoning is the one that supports the idea that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it directly supports Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer without his permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission.
