Solution:
The mayor claims that new recycling projects could greatly reduce the amount of garbage that the city must dispose of, but also claims that these projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage. 
To resolve this inconsistency, we need to find an option that explains how new recycling projects could be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage.
Option [REDACTED] explains that the great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken. This option suggests that the city has limited resources and must prioritize which projects to undertake. Therefore, the mayor's claim that new recycling projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage could be valid if the costs of these projects would prevent other more effective pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.
