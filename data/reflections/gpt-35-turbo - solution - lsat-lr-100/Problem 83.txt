The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it was ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton was captured by Neptune's gravity. The assumption must be related to this fact and the definition of a true planet.
Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because it does not explain why Pluto is not a true planet.
Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it assumes that a celestial body must form in orbit around the sun exclusively to be a true planet. This assumption is necessary because Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune.
