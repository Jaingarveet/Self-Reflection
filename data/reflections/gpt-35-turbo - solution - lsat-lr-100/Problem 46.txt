Solution:
The archaeologist argues that the mosaics should have been left in their original location to avoid misleading future archaeologists who may not have access to their records. To justify this reasoning, we need an assumption that supports the idea that removing artifacts from archaeological sites can lead to misleading conclusions. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument that the decision to remove the mosaics should have been based solely on archaeological considerations.
