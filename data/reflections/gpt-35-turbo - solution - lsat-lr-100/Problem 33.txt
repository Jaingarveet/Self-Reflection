Solution:
The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on the experiment conducted on 50 patients with chronic back pain. To counter this argument logically, we need to provide evidence that weakens the conclusion drawn from the experiment. Option [REDACTED] suggests that the improvement in the condition of patients could be due to the placebo effect. If a patient's improvement in condition could be due to the placebo effect, then the experiment's results are not reliable, and the conclusion drawn from the experiment is weakened.
