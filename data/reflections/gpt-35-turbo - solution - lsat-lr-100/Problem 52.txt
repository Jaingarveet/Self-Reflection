Solution:
The argument above assumes that a necessary condition is also a sufficient condition. Specifically, it assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is that it lacks a protective cover. The argument ignores other possible reasons. Answer choice [REDACTED] has the same flawed pattern of reasoning. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly. The argument ignores other possible reasons for premature tire wear.
