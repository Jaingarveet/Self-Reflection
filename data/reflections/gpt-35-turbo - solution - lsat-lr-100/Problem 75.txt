Solution:
The Figorian Development Commission believes that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth, and that they have the right to govern their own resources. Therefore, the principle that would most strongly support their position would be one that emphasizes the right of individual nations to govern their own resources. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
