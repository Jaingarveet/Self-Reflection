Solution:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages, based on the fact that Group [REDACTED] (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group [REDACTED] (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
Option [REDACTED] is the least helpful in establishing the conclusion because it does not relate to memory or the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time.
