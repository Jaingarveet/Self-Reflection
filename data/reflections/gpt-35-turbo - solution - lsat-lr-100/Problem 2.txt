Solution:
Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
Most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Therefore, it is not necessary that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.
