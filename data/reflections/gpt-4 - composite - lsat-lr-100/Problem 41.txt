Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the flaw in the argument. I focused on the dismissal of Professor Riley's claim due to her feud with the president, rather than the assumption that the speech could only be inappropriate if it was inflammatory.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Argument analysis error
Solution:
The argument is flawed because it assumes that the only way the president's speech could be inappropriate is if it was inflammatory. This is not necessarily true, as there could be other reasons for the speech to be deemed inappropriate. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]."
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and understand the main points.
2. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
3. Analyze the reasoning used to reach the conclusion.
4. Identify any assumptions or flaws in the reasoning.
5. Match the identified flaw with the options provided.
6. Choose the answer that best describes the flaw in the argument.
Advice:
- Always read the argument carefully and understand the main points.
- Identify the conclusion and the reasoning used to reach it.
- Look for any assumptions or flaws in the reasoning.
- Don't focus solely on one aspect of the argument, consider all elements.
- Practice logical reasoning and argument analysis to improve your skills.
