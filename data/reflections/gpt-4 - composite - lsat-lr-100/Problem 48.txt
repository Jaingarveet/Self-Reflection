Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the relationship between marketing and enrollment, rather than the relationship between spending and the quality of education. The president's argument is based on the assumption that reducing spending will affect the quality of education, which is the correct assumption to draw the conclusion.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Assumption error
Solution:
The president's argument is that if the university does not increase its enrollment, it will have to reduce spending. If spending is reduced, the quality of education will be affected. Therefore, to maintain the quality of education, the university must increase its enrollment through aggressive marketing. The assumption that makes this argument valid is that reducing spending will affect the quality of education. So, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and understand the conclusion.
2. Identify the premises leading to the conclusion.
3. Understand the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
4. Identify the underlying assumption that connects the premises to the conclusion.
5. Choose the answer that correctly represents this assumption.
Advice:

- Identify the premises leading to the conclusion.
- Understand the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
