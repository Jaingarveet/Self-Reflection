Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information provided in the passage. I focused on the variability of allergic reactions among individuals, rather than considering the variability of proteins among cats.
Error Keywords:
- Reading comprehension error
- Misinterpretation error
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The passage states that the proteins responsible for allergic reactions vary from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva, which contain these proteins. This implies that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
