Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the risk aspect of the argument but overlooked the necessity aspect. The radio producer's argument is based on a necessity (paying bills) that forces a choice between two options. The correct answer should reflect this pattern of reasoning.

Solution:
The radio producer's argument is based on a necessity (paying bills) that forces a choice between two options, where one option (sticking with classical music) does not meet the necessity. Therefore, the producer concludes that the other option (devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music) should be chosen. 
Looking at the choices, option [REDACTED] presents a similar pattern of reasoning. It presents a necessity (non-standard window sizes) that forces a choice between two options (making curtains or buying blinds), where one option (buying blinds) does not meet the necessity. Therefore, the conclusion is that the other option (making curtains) should be chosen.
