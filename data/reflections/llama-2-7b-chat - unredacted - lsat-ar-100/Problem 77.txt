  Great job! You have correctly analyzed the situation and arrived at the correct answer. Here's a breakdown of your thought process:

1. You identified the relevant rules from the problem statement: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
2. You used these rules to eliminate certain parking spaces for each employee: Togowa can only be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6, Souza can only be assigned parking spaces #3 or #4, and Young can only be assigned parking spaces #1, #2, or #4.
3. You correctly observed that Souza and Togowa are the only two employees who have only two possible parking spaces available to them.
4. Based on this observation, you answered the question by selecting option B, which states that two employees have only two possible parking spaces available to them.

Well done! Here are some tips to help you improve your critical thinking and problem-solving skills:

1. Read the problem statement carefully: Make sure you understand the problem and the rules given. Pay attention to any constraints or limitations mentioned in the problem statement.
2. Break down the problem into smaller parts: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems or steps. This will help you analyze each part of the problem separately and arrive at a solution.
3. Use visual aids: Draw diagrams or use other visual aids to help you visualize the problem and the possible solutions. This can help you identify patterns and connections between different parts of the problem.
4. Look for patterns and connections: Look for patterns and connections between different parts of the problem. This can help you identify possible solutions and eliminate incorrect options.
5. Check your work: Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure that your answer is correct.

By following these tips, you can improve your critical thinking and problem-solving skills and become more confident in your ability to solve complex problems.
