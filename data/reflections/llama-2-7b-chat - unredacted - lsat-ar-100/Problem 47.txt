 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. After reevaluating the conditions and the options, I realized that the correct answer is (A) Image's voicemail target.

Here's my thought process:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Since Image's website target is 2 days, it means that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days.

2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Since Solide's voicemail target is 3 days, it means that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than 3 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 2 days.

Therefore, the answer is (A) Image's voicemail target.

Advice:

1. Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Break down complex problems into smaller subproblems and evaluate each subproblem step-by-step.
3. Use logical reasoning and deduction to arrive at the correct answer.
4. Double-check your calculations and assumptions to ensure accuracy.
5. Pay close attention to the conditions and constraints given in the problem, as they may provide important clues to the solution.
