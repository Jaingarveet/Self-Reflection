  Thank you for providing the reflection and the correct answer. Here's the revised response in the correct format:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is (D): No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it. This constraint ensures that the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses, which is the same effect as the original constraint. The other options do not have the same effect, as they either do not ensure separation or do not consider the specific locations of the businesses in the shopping center.
