  Great job! You have correctly analyzed the situation and identified the correct answer. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the steps you took to arrive at the correct answer:

1. You recognized that the problem statement was asking for a condition that must be true if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
2. You used a diagram to represent the information given in the problem, which helped you visualize the relationships between the different batches of cookies.
3. You identified the key conditions in the problem, including the fact that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
4. You used logical reasoning to determine that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and that the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
