Explanation:
I focused on the general complications of surgery and the specific complications of cyst-gastrostomy without considering the anatomical context of the procedure. The correct answer, "hemorrhage," is a major concern due to the rich vascular supply of the pancreas and the potential for damage to nearby blood vessels. 

Error Keywords:
- Overgeneralization
- Lack of anatomical context

Solution:
Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic cysts or pseudocysts. While infection, obstruction, and fistula formation are potential complications, the major concern specific to this procedure is hemorrhage. The pancreas has a rich vascular supply, and there is a significant risk of bleeding during the operation or as a postoperative complication. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the context: Cyst-gastrostomy is a procedure for pancreatic cysts/pseudocysts.
2. Consider anatomical context: Recognize the rich vascular supply of the pancreas.
3. Evaluate complications: Infection, obstruction, and fistula are general surgical risks, but hemorrhage is a major concern due to the anatomy.
4. Choose the answer: D - Hemorrhage is the major complication to consider for this specific procedure.

Advice:
- Consider the anatomical context and unique characteristics of the surgical site when evaluating potential complications. 
- Recognize that while general surgical complications are important, certain procedures carry specific risks due to the anatomy involved. 
- Always review potential complications for each procedure, especially those related to the unique aspects of the anatomy being operated on.
