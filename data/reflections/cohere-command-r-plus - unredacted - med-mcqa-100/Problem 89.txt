Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the usefulness of an investigation was based on its specialized nature and frequency of use. 
However, the correct answer is based on the standard diagnostic approach for Spondylolisthesis, where AP X-rays are, in fact, the primary tool. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Diagnostic error
 - Orthopaedic error
Solution:
Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward onto another.
Standard diagnostic imaging includes:
 - Anteroposterior (AP) X-rays to view vertebral alignment and any slip or displacement.
 - Lateral X-rays to assess spinal stability and identify potential nerve compression.
CT and MRI scans provide detailed information and are often used for surgical planning but are not routinely required for initial diagnosis.
The AP X-ray is the primary tool for diagnosis and is therefore the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Understand Spondylolisthesis and its standard diagnostic approach.
2. Recognize that AP X-rays are essential for initial diagnosis.
3. Identify that CT and MRI scans are not always necessary but have specific indications.
4. Choose the answer that represents the most routine and fundamental diagnostic tool.
Advice:
 - Ensure you have a solid understanding of the standard diagnostic approach for common conditions.
 - Avoid making assumptions based on specialized or advanced techniques.
 - Consider the fundamental tools used in initial diagnosis.
 - Remember that the most common and widely accessible investigation is often the correct answer.
 - Do not overthink the question; rely on your foundational knowledge.
