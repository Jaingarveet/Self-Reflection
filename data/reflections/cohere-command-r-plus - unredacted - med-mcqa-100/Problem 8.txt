Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the concept of "equal chances" in randomization. I associated "equal chances" with the outcome or result of randomization, rather than the process itself. I focused on the "unknown" aspect, assuming that it leads to equal outcomes, which is not necessarily true. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overinterpretation
- Outcome bias

Solution: 
Randomization is a process that ensures each participant has an equal chance of being assigned to any group in a study. This equal chance is a known factor in the design of the study. However, the specific group assignment remains unknown until the randomization process is complete. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the concept of randomization: ensuring equal chances for all participants. 
2. Recognize that "equal chances" refer to the design and process, not the outcome. 
3. Acknowledge that the chances are known to be equal, while the specific group assignments remain unknown. 
4. Choose the answer option that aligns with the explained concept. 

Advice: 
 - Familiarize yourself with fundamental concepts and definitions in research methodology. 
 - Avoid overinterpreting or extending the meaning beyond what is explicitly stated. 
 - Focus on the process and design, not potential outcomes, when dealing with randomization concepts. 
 - Remember that "equal chances" in randomization refer to the probability of group assignment, not the distribution of outcomes. 
 - Always choose the most precise and specific answer option that aligns with the provided information.
