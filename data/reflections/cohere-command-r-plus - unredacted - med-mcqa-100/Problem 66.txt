Solution: Hepatitis A is a contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus. The virus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and understanding the timing of viral shedding in feces is crucial for implementing effective control measures. 

The correct answer is D:
- Hepatitis A virus shedding in feces typically occurs about "two weeks before" the onset of symptoms. 
- Viral shedding can continue for "up to two weeks after" the symptoms appear, or even after the symptoms resolve. 

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific information requested (viral shedding duration).
2. Recall the characteristics of Hepatitis A virus transmission.
3. Decompose the problem into two parts: shedding before symptoms and shedding after symptoms.
4. Address each part separately and confirm the duration for each.
5. Choose the answer that matches the combined duration before and after symptoms.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully to identify the specific information requested.
- Decompose complex problems into simpler parts to address them more effectively.
- Pay attention to details and ensure you consider all relevant aspects of the topic.
- Double-check your interpretation of the question and your understanding of the topic.
- Avoid making rushed conclusions; carefully review all the provided options before selecting an answer.
