Explanation:
I incorrectly identified argument E as having the most similar reasoning to the original argument. While E does have some similarities, upon further reflection, argument C is a better match.
The original argument states that if the party's theories were sound and implemented, inflation would have decreased. Since inflation increased, the theories must have been flawed. 
Argument C follows the same structure - if the company sold subsidiaries and bought the patent, the stock price would have doubled. The stock price didn't increase, so the company must have failed to sell the subsidiaries.
In contrast, while argument E has a similar "if X then Y, not Y, therefore not X" structure, the specifics of the reasoning are less analogous to the original argument compared to argument C.
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentifying analogous reasoning
 - Incomplete comparison of argument structures
 - Focusing on superficial similarities over deeper structure
Solution:
The original argument has the following structure:
1. If X (party's theories sound and implemented), then Y (inflation decreases)
2. Not Y (inflation increased)
3. Therefore, not X (party's theories flawed)
Let's compare this to argument C:
1. If X (company sold subsidiaries and bought patent), then Y (stock price doubles)
2. Not Y (stock price didn't increase)
3. Therefore, not X (company failed to sell subsidiaries)
Argument C follows the exact same reasoning pattern as the original argument, just with different specifics. The other arguments, while having some structural similarities, are not as directly analogous.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the original argument and identify its reasoning structure.
2. For each answer choice, map out the reasoning structure of that argument.
3. Compare each answer choice's reasoning structure to the original argument's structure.
4. Identify which answer choice argument has the reasoning structure that most closely matches the original argument.
5. Don't get distracted by superficial similarities; focus on the core logic and structure of the arguments.
6. Double check that the argument you chose as most analogous really does mirror the original argument's reasoning.
Advice:
 - In questions asking you to identify analogous reasoning, always start by clearly mapping out the structure of the original argument.
 - Break down each answer choice argument into its core components and reasoning structure.
 - Systematically compare each answer choice's structure to the original argument's structure.
 - Focus on the deep structure and logic of the arguments, not superficial similarities in topic or wording.
 - Always double check your chosen answer to ensure it truly is the closest match to the original argument's reasoning.
