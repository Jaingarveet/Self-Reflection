Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the argument's assumption that shedding tears is sufficient to reduce emotional stress, overlooking the more fundamental flaw in the reasoning. The argument takes for granted that because stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of emotional stress. However, the mere presence of a substance when a condition occurs does not necessarily mean that the substance causes the condition.
Error Keywords:
 - Causal reasoning error
 - Confusing correlation with causation
 - Assuming causation based on co-occurrence
Solution:
The argument notes that human tears contain many of the same hormones that the body produces during emotional stress. It then asserts that because shedding tears removes these hormones from the body, crying must reduce emotional stress.
However, the argument assumes that because stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of emotional stress. This is a flawed assumption. The mere presence of these hormones in tears when stress occurs does not necessarily mean that the hormones themselves cause the stress.
It's entirely possible that both the stress hormones and the emotional stress are effects of some other common cause, rather than the hormones causing the stress. The argument fails to consider this possibility and simply takes for granted that the presence of the hormones in tears means they are a cause of stress.
Therefore, the reasoning is most vulnerable to the criticism that it takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition.
Instructions:
1. Identify the evidence presented in the argument.
2. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
3. Look for gaps or assumptions in the reasoning that connects the evidence to the conclusion.
4. Consider alternative explanations or possibilities that the argument overlooks.
5. Determine which of the given answer choices best captures the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Advice:
 - Be cautious of arguments that assume causation based merely on correlation or co-occurrence.
 - Always consider alternative explanations for correlations, such as the possibility of a common cause.
 - Don't take for granted that because something is present when a condition occurs, it must be a cause of that condition.
 - Scrutinize the logical connection between an argument's premises and its conclusion.
 - Eliminate answer choices that identify flaws not present in the argument or that don't directly undermine the reasoning.
