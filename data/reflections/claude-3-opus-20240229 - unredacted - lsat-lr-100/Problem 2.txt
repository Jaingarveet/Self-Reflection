Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that answer choice C must be true based on the given information. However, the question asks which statement must be true, not which statement could be true. While C could be true, it is not necessarily true based on the given information.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Necessary vs. possible conditions
 - Misinterpreting question requirements
 - Incorrectly inferring conclusions
Solution:
Given:
1. Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
2. This year, most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Analyzing the answer choices:
A: Not necessarily true. The information is about Lac Nichoutec prize-winners, not all Canadian films at international festivals.
B: Not necessarily true. The information doesn't indicate the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec.
C: Could be true, but not necessarily. If even one international prize-winner was not Canadian, this would be false.
D: Must be true. If most (but not all) Lac Nichoutec winners won internationally, then at least one Lac Nichoutec winner must not have won internationally.
E: Not necessarily true. It's possible that all international prize-winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
Therefore, D is the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify what it is asking for (a statement that must be true, not could be true).
2. Identify the given information and constraints.
3. Consider each answer choice individually.
4. For each choice, determine if it must be true based solely on the given information, not on assumptions.
5. Eliminate choices that could be true but are not necessarily true.
6. Select the choice that must be true based on the given information.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully to understand exactly what is being asked.
 - Base your reasoning only on the given information, not on assumptions or possibilities.
 - Consider each answer choice individually and systematically.
 - Distinguish between statements that must be true and those that could be true but are not necessarily true.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted inferences or assumptions beyond the given information.
