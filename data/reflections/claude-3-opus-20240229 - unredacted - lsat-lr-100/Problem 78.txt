Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument required assuming that most employees currently have a short commute. However, the argument does not provide any information about the current commute times. The argument only states that after the move, most employees will have a long commute because they cannot afford housing near Ocean View.
The correct assumption is that there will not be a significant pay raise accompanying the move. If there was a large pay raise, it could allow employees to afford housing near Ocean View, negating the conclusion that most will have a long commute.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Missing information
 - Irrelevant assumption
 - Compensation oversight
Solution:
1. Acme Corporation is moving from Milltown to Ocean View.
2. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
3. The argument concludes that after the move, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes.
4. For this conclusion to hold, we must assume there will not be a significant pay raise that would allow employees to afford housing near Ocean View.
5. If employees received a large pay raise, they might be able to afford housing near Ocean View, making the conclusion false.
6. Therefore, the argument requires assuming choice E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the facts provided in the argument.
3. Determine what additional piece of information must be true for the conclusion to logically follow from the facts.
4. Don't make assumptions beyond what is provided in the argument.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or already stated in the argument.
6. Choose the answer choice that, if false, would make the conclusion illogical or unsupported.
Advice:
 - Focus on the logical structure of the argument.
 - Don't bring in outside knowledge or make unsupported assumptions.
 - The correct answer choice will be a critical piece of information required for the conclusion to follow from the premises.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, already stated, or go beyond the scope of the argument.
 - Consider how the argument would be impacted if each answer choice were false.
