Explanation:
I incorrectly identified argument D as having the same flaw as the original argument. While D does have flawed reasoning, it is not the same flaw as the original. I failed to recognize that argument E actually contains the same logical flaw as the original argument.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misidentifying analogous reasoning flaw
 - Mistaking different reasoning errors as the same
 - Overlooking correct analogous reasoning error
Solution:
The original argument concludes that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits because:
1) Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. 
2) Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
The flaw is assuming the majority of the larger group (auto mechanics) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (mechanics with extensive experience).
Looking at argument E:
1) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services in summer.
2) Most lawn-care service companies hire additional workers in summer. 
3) The flawed conclusion is that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in summer.
This makes the same error of assuming the majority of the larger group (snow-removal companies) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (lawn-care service companies).
Instructions:
1. Identify the logical structure and flaw in the original argument.
2. For each answer choice, map out the logical structure of the argument.
3. Compare the reasoning in each choice to the original argument.
4. Eliminate choices that have different reasoning errors or are not flawed.
5. Select the choice with the same flawed reasoning pattern as the original.
Advice:
 - Always break arguments down into their component logical steps.
 - Identify the specific nature of flawed reasoning, don't just note that it's flawed.
 - When comparing reasoning, focus on the logical structure, not just surface similarities.
 - Map out the logic of each argument fully before judging similarities.
 - Don't be distracted by arguments that are flawed in different ways than the original.
