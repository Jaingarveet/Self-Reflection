Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that Yuki could test H on the first day, which would then be tested by Seamus on the second day. However, this would mean that Theresa, who must test H, would not be able to do so, as each bicycle can only be tested by one rider per day.
