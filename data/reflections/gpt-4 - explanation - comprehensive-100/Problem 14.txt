Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the sales department could not be one level above the administrative department because it would be adjacent to the human resources department. However, the condition only states that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent, not that they cannot be on consecutive floors.
