Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the information in the passage that stated no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that if crops were planted, they might compete with the weeds, potentially reducing the percentage of the surface covered with weeds.
