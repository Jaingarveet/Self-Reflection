Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy had to be in space 1 because the shoe store was in space 2. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, not necessarily next to the shoe store.
