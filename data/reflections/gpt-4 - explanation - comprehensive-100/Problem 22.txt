Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions regarding when Nina can give a report. I assumed that Nina could not report on Monday because George is the only one who can report on Tuesday. However, the condition is that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina can report on Monday, and Helen and Irving can report on Tuesday.
