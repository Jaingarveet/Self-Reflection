Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't consider the context of the question. The question was asking for the completion of the text, not necessarily the next step in a process. The correct answer was providing additional information about the website addresses for different countries, which is relevant to the previous step of searching for "olx (your country)".
