Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the requirement that "at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected." I thought this meant that the number of French novels could be equal to or more than the number of Russian novels, but it actually means that the number of French novels must be equal to or less than the number of Russian novels.
