Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of specifics 
- Overlooking absolute language
- Confusing initial success factors with ongoing competition
Corrected Solution:
The paragraph states that to start your own company, you absolutely must ("have to") be great in at least one thing compared to others. It then lists a hierarchy - if others have an equally good product, you need to be faster. If speed is the same, you need lower costs, and so on. 
This strong language and progressive example emphasize that being the best in at least one area is a requirement for a new company to succeed, not just an advantage. The paragraph is focused on initial success factors for a startup, not long-term competition.
Therefore, answer [REDACTED], "Unless your company is doing its best in at least one thing, it cannot succeed in market competition", is the closest in meaning. It correctly captures the necessity of being the best in one area for early success.
