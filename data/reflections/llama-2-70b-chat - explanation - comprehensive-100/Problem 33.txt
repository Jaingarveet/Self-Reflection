Explanation:
The argument claims that the average citizen of the town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. However, option [REDACTED] states that more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities. This means that the increase in calls involving violent crimes may not necessarily indicate an increase in the overall risk of violent crime for the average citizen, but rather an increase in the number of people reporting violent crimes. This weakens the argument by suggesting that the increase in reported violent crimes may be due to an increase in reporting rather than an actual increase in violent crime. Therefore, option [REDACTED] most seriously weakens the argument.
