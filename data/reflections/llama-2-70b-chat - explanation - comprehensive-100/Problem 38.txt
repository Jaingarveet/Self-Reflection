Explanation:
The economics professor's conclusion that Checkers' motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza can be properly drawn by assuming choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The professor's argument is that Checkers refused to accept the coupons despite it costing them nothing and satisfying their potential customers, which suggests that their motive was to hurt Marty's Pizza. Choice [REDACTED] supports this argument by stating that a company that wishes to hurt a competitor will refuse to accept their coupons even when it would be beneficial to do so. Therefore, assuming choice [REDACTED] allows the professor's conclusion to be properly drawn.
