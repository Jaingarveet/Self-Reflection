Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the exception to the rule. Aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required for all amino acids except proline, which is synthesized from glutamine. However, hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine and does not require aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED].
