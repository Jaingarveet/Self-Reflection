Explanation:
The passage states that "not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva." This implies that different cats may have different proteins in their skin secretions and saliva, which can cause different allergic reactions in people who are allergic to cats. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about different breeds of cats.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because the passage states that all cats are capable of provoking allergic reactions, but it does not say that all cats will cause an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the intensity of allergic reactions.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while it is true that it is impossible to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer, this is not the main point of the passage. The passage focuses on the fact that all cats are capable of provoking allergic reactions, and that different cats may have different proteins in their skin secretions and saliva that can cause allergic reactions in different people.
