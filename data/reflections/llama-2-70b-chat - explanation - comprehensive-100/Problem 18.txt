Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I assumed that Robot 1 was Type [REDACTED] because it picked up the red squares instead of the red balls, and that Robot 2 was Type [REDACTED] because it picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true.
