Advice:
 - Read the question and requirements carefully, multiple times if needed, to fully understand the relationships and constraints between the works of literature. 
 - Avoid making hasty conclusions or eliminating choices based on partial assessments. 
 - Consider each requirement independently and assess each choice against all requirements collectively. 
 - Remember that the requirements are interrelated and should be considered as a whole when evaluating the options. 
 - Always double-check your interpretation of the requirements and their application to each choice.
