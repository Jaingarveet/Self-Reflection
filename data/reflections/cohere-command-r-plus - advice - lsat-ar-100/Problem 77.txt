Advice:
- Understand the rules and conditions thoroughly. Ensure you interpret "must be higher/lower" as providing flexibility rather than strict limitations. 
- Consider the most flexible scenarios first, as these will provide the lower bound for the number of possible options. 
- Systematically work through each employee's options, considering the impact of each possible assignment on the remaining employees.
