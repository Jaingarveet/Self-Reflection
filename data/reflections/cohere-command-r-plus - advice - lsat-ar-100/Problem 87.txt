Advice:
 - Always carefully read and understand the problem statement and constraints. 
 - Break down complex constraints into simpler, more manageable conditions. 
 - Analyze the implications of each constraint on the possible solutions. 
 - Ensure that your interpretation of the constraints is consistent and logical.
