Advice:
 - Identify all constraints and their implications. 
 - Consider the cumulative impact of constraints, as they may interact in complex ways. 
 - Avoid focusing solely on a subset of constraints; ensure you consider their collective effect. 
 - Draw or visualize potential arrangements to aid in understanding their validity. 
 - Double-check your interpretation of each constraint and its impact on the arrangement.
