Advice:
- Read and understand all the constraints carefully. 
- Avoid making assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated. 
- Look for arrangements that satisfy the constraints, rather than assuming a fixed order. 
- Consider all possibilities and evaluate them systematically. 
- Double-check your interpretation of the constraints and their application to each choice.
