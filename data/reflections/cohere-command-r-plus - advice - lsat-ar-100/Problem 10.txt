Advice:

- Read and understand all constraints carefully, paying attention to minimum and maximum requirements, relationships, and dependencies. 
- Systematically evaluate each option against all constraints, checking off each requirement as you go. 
- Don't stop at the first valid option; continue evaluating all options to ensure you don't miss a better solution. 
- Double-check your interpretation of constraints and your evaluation logic to catch any misunderstandings or errors.
