Advice:
 - Create a visual representation of the conditions to help identify relationships and eliminate choices. 
 - Analyze each choice systematically, step-by-step, rather than trying to solve the problem mentally all at once. 
 - Ensure you fully understand each condition before making eliminations or selections. 
 - Remember that logical deductions should be based on the information given, not on assumptions or external knowledge. 
 - Double-check your interpretation of negative conditions ("not both") to avoid oversight.
