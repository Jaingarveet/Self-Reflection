Advice:
 - Always read and understand all the conditions provided in the question. 
 - Be careful not to make assumptions or jump to conclusions; work methodically through each option. 
 - Consider the implications of each choice, step-by-step, and evaluate whether it satisfies all the conditions or violates any rules. 
 - Look for the option that is the only valid scenario among the choices provided. 
 - Remember that the question asks for what "must be true," so seek the option that is the necessary consequence of the given conditions.
