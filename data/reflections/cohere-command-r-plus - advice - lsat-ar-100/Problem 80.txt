Advice:
- Read and understand the conditions carefully, ensuring a clear interpretation. 
- Do not make assumptions or jump to conclusions; work through each step logically. 
- Consider all conditions together, rather than in isolation, to avoid missing interactions between them. 
- Remember that the conditions must all be met simultaneously, so each option should be scrutinized thoroughly. 
- Double-check your interpretation and solution to prevent errors arising from misunderstandings.
