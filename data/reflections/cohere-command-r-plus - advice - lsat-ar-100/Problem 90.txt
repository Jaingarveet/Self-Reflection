Advice:
- Read and understand the conditions thoroughly before making any decisions.
- Identify all constraints and relationships between the options to avoid overlooking critical information.
- Start by eliminating choices that clearly violate the conditions to narrow down the possibilities.
- Assign targets systematically, ensuring that each assignment satisfies the conditions and constraints.
- Review your choices and identify patterns or unique options that stand out as unlikely to be correct.
