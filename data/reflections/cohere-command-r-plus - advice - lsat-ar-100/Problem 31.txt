Advice:
 - Always read and re-read the conditions to ensure a clear understanding. 
 - Break down complex conditions into simpler components to make them easier to work with. 
 - Start with the conditions that provide the most specific information and work from there. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or logical jumps that are not explicitly supported by the given information. 
 - Double-check your interpretation of the conditions and how they apply to each option. 
 - Remember that the conditions must all be satisfied simultaneously, so ensure that your interpretation allows for that.
