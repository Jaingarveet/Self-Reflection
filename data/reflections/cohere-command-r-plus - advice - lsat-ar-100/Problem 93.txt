Advice:
 - Focus on the given conditions and their implications. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or inferences beyond what is explicitly stated. 
 - Consider all conditions simultaneously to narrow down the options. 
 - Look for options that are consistent with all conditions. 
 - Practice similar multi-condition logic problems to improve pattern recognition.
