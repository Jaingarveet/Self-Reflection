Advice:

- Create a systematic approach by placing S in each position and evaluating the consequences for other variables. 
- Break down complex conditions into simpler ones. For example, "S can be earlier than Q only if Q is [REDACTED]" can be simplified to "if S is [REDACTED] or second, then Q cannot be [REDACTED] or second." 
- Consider the implications of each condition individually and in combination. 
- Look for contradictions or conflicts with the conditions when evaluating each arrangement. 
- Always consider all options and don't stop at the [REDACTED] valid arrangement. Ensure that no other valid arrangements contradict your conclusion.
