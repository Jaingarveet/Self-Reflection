Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not carefully read the question and the answer choices. I assumed that none of the answer choices were correct because they did not match my understanding of the process of star formation. However, upon closer examination, I realized that choice [REDACTED] was the closest answer, even though it was not the most accurate answer.
