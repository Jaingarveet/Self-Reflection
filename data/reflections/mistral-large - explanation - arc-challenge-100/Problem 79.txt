Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the definition of a physical change. I thought that any change that involved the addition of a substance, such as acids, would be a chemical change. However, [REDACTED] (choice A) is actually a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food.
