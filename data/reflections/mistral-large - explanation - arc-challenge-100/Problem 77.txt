Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the relationship between the sheep's physical traits and their vulnerability to predation.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the concept of natural selection and how it applies to this scenario.
I assumed that larger and stronger sheep would be more vulnerable to predation, but in reality, they are more likely to survive and reproduce.
