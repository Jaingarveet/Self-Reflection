Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], "the same number of atoms," as the correct answer. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"
While both samples of aluminum are made up of the same number of atoms, the state of matter of the samples is different. 
The solid sample has a definite shape and volume, while the liquid sample has a definite volume but not [REDACTED]
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of states of matter
 - Confusion between shape and volume
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
[REDACTED] small, solid sample of aluminum has a definite shape and volume.
[REDACTED] large, liquid sample of aluminum has a definite volume but not [REDACTED]
Both samples are made up of [REDACTED]
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the two samples of aluminum being compared.
3. Recall the properties of solids and liquids.
4. Determine the state of matter of each sample.
5. Identify the property that both samples share.
6. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.
7. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always recall the relevant concepts and properties related to the question.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the properties of solids and liquids are different.
