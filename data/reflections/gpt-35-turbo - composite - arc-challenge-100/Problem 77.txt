Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the sheep with light wool would have an advantage over the sheep with dark wool when a new predator is introduced. However, the question states that the sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns.

Solution:
The sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns. When a new predator is introduced, the sheep with light wool are more likely to be targeted and killed, which will result in a decrease in their population.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the characteristics of the sheep with dark wool and the sheep with light wool.
3. Consider how these characteristics may affect the survival and breeding of the sheep.
4. Consider how the introduction of a new predator may affect the survival and breeding of the sheep.
5. Choose the answer that best matches your reasoning.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all the information provided in the question.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
