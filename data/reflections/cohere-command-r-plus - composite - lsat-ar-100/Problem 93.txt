Solution:

Given the conditions, we can deduce the following: 
1. Image's voicemail target is the shortest. 
2. Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's. 
3. None of the clients have a website target of 2 days. 

From this, we can determine that Solide's voicemail target could be shorter than Truvest's, as this does not contradict any of the given conditions. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions: 
    - Image's voicemail target is the shortest. 
    - Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's. 
    - None of the clients have a website target of 2 days. 
2. List the potential options that satisfy all the conditions.
3. Eliminate options that violate the given conditions.
4. Choose the option that satisfies all conditions without making assumptions. 

Advice:
 - Focus on the given conditions and their implications. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or inferences beyond what is explicitly stated. 
 - Consider all conditions simultaneously to narrow down the options. 
 - Look for options that are consistent with all conditions. 
 - Practice similar multi-condition logic problems to improve pattern recognition.
