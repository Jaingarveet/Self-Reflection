Solution:

The conditions provided in the question offer a set of constraints that narrow down the possible arrangements of the books on the shelves. 

Given that: 
1. "O is placed on a higher shelf than L" 
2. "F is placed on the same shelf as M" 
3. "K is on a higher shelf than F" 

We can deduce the following: 

As F and M are on the same shelf, they must be considered together as a unit. K, being on a higher shelf than F, eliminates the possibility of K being on the middle shelf, as that would violate the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf (assuming I and F/M are already on the middle shelf). 

This leaves only two options for K: the top or bottom shelf. Placing K on the bottom shelf would also place it below O, which contradicts the condition that O is higher than L (and, by extension, F/M). 

Therefore, K must be on the top shelf. This automatically places O on the middle shelf, as O cannot be on the same shelf as I or K (given their respective placements). 

With this arrangement, we can see that O is indeed placed on a higher shelf than M, satisfying the conditions provided. 

Instructions:

1. Identify and list all given conditions. 
2. Diagram or visualize the arrangement of books and shelves to help understand their relationships. 
3. Start with the conditions that provide the strongest constraints on placement. 
4. Work through the implications of each condition step-by-step, considering their impact on the placement of the books. 
5. Double-check that your arrangement satisfies all conditions, especially those that may have been initially overlooked. 

Advice:

- Pay close attention to all given conditions and ensure they are all considered. 
- Visual aids can be immensely helpful in organizing information and identifying patterns or relationships. 
- Start with the most restrictive conditions first to narrow down possibilities quickly. 
- Always double-check your work, especially when complex conditions are involved. 
- Ensure that your reasoning is explicit and step-by-step, avoiding broad jumps in logic.
