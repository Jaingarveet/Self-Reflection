Solution:
To ensure that Wayne performs a modern piece before any traditional pieces, he can be assigned the second solo as a modern piece. This satisfies the condition and allows for the consecutive traditional pieces to be the third and [REDACTED]th solos. The fifth solo can then be a modern piece performed by Zara. This results in a minimum of [REDACTED] traditional pieces performed by Wayne, as all conditions are met without him performing any traditional solos.

Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions provided:
   - Third solo is a traditional piece.
   - Exactly [REDACTED] traditional pieces are consecutive.
   - Fourth solo: Wayne plays a traditional piece or Zara plays a modern piece.
   - Pianist of the second solo doesn't play the fifth.
   - No traditional piece until Wayne plays at least [REDACTED] modern piece.
2. Assign solos that satisfy the conditions:
   - Solo 2: Wayne plays a modern piece (satisfies condition 5).
   - Solo 3: Traditional piece (condition 1).
   - Solo 4: Traditional piece (conditions 2 and 4).
   - Solo 5: Zara plays a modern piece (conditions 2 and 4).
3. Count the number of traditional pieces performed by Wayne:
   - Wayne performs [REDACTED] traditional pieces, satisfying all conditions.

Advice:
- Read and understand all conditions provided.
- Look for explicit constraints and their implications.
- Avoid making assumptions beyond what is given.
- Consider the minimum and maximum possibilities to narrow down the answer.
- Test your assumptions by trying different scenarios.
- Be mindful of the specific wording and logic of the conditions.
