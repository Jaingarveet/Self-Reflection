Solution: Given that Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, and Kramer and O'Neill both review "Tamerlane," we can deduce the following:

- Kramer and O'Neill have two plays in common: "Tamerlane" and one other play, let's call it "Play X."
- Megregian must also review "Play X" since exactly two students have the same play selection.
- Lopez cannot review "Tamerlane" or "Play X" as that would make three students with the same play selection.
- This leaves "Sunset" and "Undulation" for Lopez and Jiang to review.
- Since Jiang doesn't review "Tamerlane," they must review either "Sunset" or "Undulation." However, we cannot determine the specific play Jiang reviews, as it could be either.
- Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options.

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions and relationships between the students and their play reviews.
2. Interpret the conditions correctly, especially the one stating that exactly two students have the same play selection.
3. Deduce the possible play combinations for each student, considering the conditions.
4. Eliminate options that do not satisfy the conditions.
5. Recognize that the correct answer is not provided and respond accordingly.

Advice:
- Read and understand the question and conditions carefully.
- Logical interpretation is critical. Ensure you correctly understand the relationships and constraints between different entities.
- Avoid making assumptions or overgeneralizing based on limited information.
- Consider all possibilities and deduce the most likely scenarios.
- Stay organized by creating a table or diagram to represent the relationships and conditions.
- Practice similar logic puzzles to improve your reasoning skills.
