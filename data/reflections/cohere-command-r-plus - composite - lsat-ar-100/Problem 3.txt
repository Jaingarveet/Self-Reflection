Solution:
Given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3, we can deduce the following:
1. Young must be assigned a higher number than #3. The only available higher number is #4.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher number than Souza. This could be #5 and #6 or vice versa.
3. Togowa and Vaughn are not subject to any specific conditions and can be assigned to the remaining spaces, #1 and #2, in either order.
4. Therefore, the only condition that must be true is that Young is assigned parking space #4, which is option [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Assign Robertson parking space #3 as given.
2. Identify the conditions that must be satisfied regarding Young, Xu, and Souza in relation to Robertson's assigned space.
3. Deduce the possible assignments for Young, Xu, Souza, Togowa, and Vaughn based on these conditions and the available parking spaces.
4. Determine which of the answer options is a definite consequence of the given conditions and assignments.

Advice:
- Read and understand all the conditions and rules governing the parking space assignments.
- Carefully interpret the conditions, avoiding assumptions or oversimplifications.
- Systematically work through each possible assignment, considering all conditions and constraints.
- Remember that the question asks for a definite consequence, so focus on identifying the options that must be true based on the given information.
