Solution:

Given that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, we can deduce the following:

- Wednesday morning: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] (must be on the same day)
- Wednesday afternoon: [REDACTED] (Lan cannot be on the same day)
- Thursday morning: [REDACTED] (must be before [REDACTED])
- Thursday afternoon: [REDACTED] (must be in the afternoon)
- Friday morning: Lan (by elimination)
- Friday afternoon: [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (by elimination, and they must be on the same day)

Therefore, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session, fulfilling the condition that his session occurs before [REDACTED]'s on Friday.

Instructions:
1. Consider each lab assistant and their constraints individually. 
2. Eliminate options that contradict the given constraints. 
3. Build a schedule, step by step, considering the relationships between the lab assistants' sessions. 
4. Refer back to the question to confirm which lab assistant must lead a Thursday session based on the provided condition. 

Advice:
 - Identify and understand all the constraints and their implications. 
 - Consider the relationships between the lab assistants and their session timings. 
 - Build a systematic schedule, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied. 
 - Avoid focusing on a single day or lab assistant; consider the overall picture. 
 - Double-check your reasoning against each constraint to prevent oversight.
