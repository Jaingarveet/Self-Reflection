Solution:

George must give a report on Tuesday, so we can fill in his name for one of the spots on that day. 

Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they will take the morning spots on two of the days. 

If Nina gives a report, then the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports. However, this does not mean that Nina, Helen, and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday. It simply sets a condition for their reports. 

Let's analyze the options:

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - George must give a report on Tuesday, so if Lenore pairs with him, there are no restrictions on who can present on Wednesday. This doesn't provide any useful information.

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If Nina gives her report on Tuesday morning, then Helen can give a report on Tuesday afternoon. This fulfills the condition that Helen and Irving give reports the day after Nina. Wednesday is still available for two other students. This option satisfies all the conditions and is, therefore, the correct answer.

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option doesn't provide any additional information or constraints, so we can dismiss it.

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Nina still needs Helen and Irving to present the day after her, so this option doesn't work.

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option doesn't provide any additional information or constraints, so we can dismiss it.

Instructions:

1. Identify the given conditions and constraints in the question.
2. Understand the implications of each condition, especially those related to Nina, Helen, and Irving's reports.
3. Analyze each option systematically, considering the constraints and their implications.
4. Look for an option that satisfies all the conditions and constraints.
5. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions based on incomplete analyses.

Advice:

- Read and understand all the conditions and constraints carefully.
- Pay close attention to the logical relationships and implications between conditions.
- Analyze each option thoroughly and systematically, testing it against the given conditions.
- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on partial analyses.
- Consider all possibilities and avoid eliminating options prematurely.
