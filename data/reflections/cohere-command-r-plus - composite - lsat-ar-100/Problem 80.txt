Solution:
Step 1: Assign Togowa and Souza to parking spaces #2 and #5, respectively, to satisfy the conditions that Xu and Young are assigned higher numbers. 
Step 2: Assign Xu a higher number than #5, which is #6. 
Step 3: Assign Young a higher number than Togowa's #2, which can be #3, #4, #5, or #6. In this case, #3 is suitable as it is higher than Togowa's #2 and satisfies the condition that Robertson is assigned a higher number. 
Step 4: Assign Robertson #4, a higher number than Young's #3, and meeting the condition that Robertson is assigned #1-#4. 
Step 5: Finally, assign Vaughn the remaining #1, as none of the conditions are violated. 

Instructions:
- Identify the conditions and rules governing the parking space assignments. 
- Interpret the conditions accurately, paying attention to the specific wording. 
- Start by assigning employees with specific number requirements, such as those who must be assigned higher or lower numbers relative to each other. 
- Work through the options methodically, eliminating those that violate the conditions. 
- Double-check that all conditions are met for the chosen option. 

Advice:
- Read and understand the conditions carefully, ensuring a clear interpretation. 
- Do not make assumptions or jump to conclusions; work through each step logically. 
- Consider all conditions together, rather than in isolation, to avoid missing interactions between them. 
- Remember that the conditions must all be met simultaneously, so each option should be scrutinized thoroughly. 
- Double-check your interpretation and solution to prevent errors arising from misunderstandings.
