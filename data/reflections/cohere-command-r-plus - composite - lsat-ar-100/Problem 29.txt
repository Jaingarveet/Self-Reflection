Solution:

Given that L is on a higher shelf than H, we know that O must be on a higher shelf than L. This means that O is on either the top or middle shelf. 

I is already placed on the middle shelf, so there is only one spot left on that shelf. K must be placed higher than F, so K and O cannot be on the same shelf as each other (choice [REDACTED] is incorrect). 

The top shelf now has two books: O and one other book. This leaves four books for the bottom shelf, which has the most books. 

We know that F and M are on the same shelf, and this could be either the top or bottom shelf. 

If F and M are on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf has H, G, I, and K, meaning that choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are correct and choice [REDACTED] is incorrect. 

However, if F and M are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf has H and G, the middle shelf has I, and the bottom shelf has F, G, M, and K, which means that choice [REDACTED] is correct, and choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are incorrect. 

Therefore, the final answer is [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given condition: L is on a higher shelf than H.
2. Determine the placement of O based on its condition.
3. Allocate two books to the top shelf and consider the remaining options for the middle and bottom shelves.
4. Place K higher than F and consider the implications for shelf arrangement.
5. Identify that F and M are on the same shelf, and consider the options for their placement.
6. Evaluate the arrangements for each choice, considering the placement of G, H, I, and K.
7. Determine the arrangement that satisfies all conditions and choose the corresponding answer choice. 

Advice:
 - Always start by identifying the given conditions and direct implications. 
 - Work through each step logically, considering all options and their implications. 
 - Avoid overthinking and focus on the given information and explicit conditions. 
 - Ensure you consider all possibilities and don't make assumptions beyond what is given. 
 - Double-check your reasoning and the final answer.
