Solution:
If Ong is assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. This means that either Kayne is not an ambassador, or he is the ambassador to Zambia. 

If Kayne is not an ambassador, then Novetzke must be an ambassador to either Yemen or Zambia. From the first constraint, if Novetzke is an ambassador, then Jaramillo must also be one. This scenario leads to Answer [REDACTED], which is incorrect because it does not consider Landon's assignment to Zambia. 

Now, if Kayne is the ambassador to Zambia, then we have to consider the other constraints. From the first constraint, if Kayne is an ambassador, then Novetzke can also be one. In this case, Novetzke would be assigned to either Yemen or Venezuela. If Novetzke is assigned to Yemen, then, from the second constraint, Jaramillo cannot be an ambassador, and we have Answer [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given condition: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela. 
2. Interpret the constraints carefully: 
    - [REDACTED] are mutually exclusive.
    - Jaramillo and Kayne are dependent.
    - If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
    - Landon must be assigned to Zambia if he is an ambassador.
3. Consider all possibilities for Kayne's assignment: 
    - Kayne is not an ambassador.
    - Kayne is the ambassador to Zambia.
4. Apply the constraints for each possibility and identify the valid options for ambassadors to Yemen and Zambia. 
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all the constraints. 

Advice:
- Interpret the constraints carefully and systematically. 
- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated or implied by the constraints. 
- Consider all possibilities and apply the constraints consistently. 
- Double-check your interpretation and reasoning by verifying that your chosen answer satisfies all the given conditions.
