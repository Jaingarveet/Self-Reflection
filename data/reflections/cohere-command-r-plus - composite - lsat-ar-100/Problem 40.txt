Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step, considering the constraints: 
1. The pharmacy must be at one end, and a restaurant must be at the other. This means spaces 1 and 7 must be occupied by the pharmacy and a restaurant. 
2. The shoe store is in space 2. 
3. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. This means that either option would satisfy this constraint: 
   - Option 1: Optometrist in space 3, Pharmacy in space 1. 
   - Option 2: Veterinarian in space 3, Pharmacy in space 1. 
4. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there are two possible arrangements for the remaining spaces: 
   - Arrangement 1: Spaces 4, 5, and 6 can be occupied by the toy store, veterinarian, and optometrist (or any order that satisfies the other constraints). 
   - Arrangement 2: Space 4 can be the second restaurant, and spaces 5 and 6 can be occupied by the toy store and veterinarian (or vice versa). 
6. Considering all the constraints and arrangements, we can determine that the optometrist can indeed be in space 5, making choice [REDACTED] a valid option. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints and their implications. 
2. Identify the fixed elements, such as the pharmacy and restaurant at the ends. 
3. Work through the remaining options for the other businesses, considering all constraints. 
4. Ensure you interpret the constraints accurately, especially those with qualitative terms like "at least." 
5. Analyze all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints. 
6. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions; consider all options. 

Advice:
- Read and understand the constraints carefully, seeking clarity on qualitative terms. 
- Identify fixed elements that provide a foundation for further analysis. 
- Consider all options and avoid making assumptions too early in the process. 
- Ensure your interpretations align with the specific wording of the constraints. 
- Analyze the problem holistically, considering all constraints and their interactions.
