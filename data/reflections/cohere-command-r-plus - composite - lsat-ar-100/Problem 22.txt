Solution: Given that G and H are selected, we can deduce the following:
- F cannot be selected due to the condition that at least one scientist of each type must be included. 
- K cannot be selected due to the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
- Therefore, the panel must include either F or K to satisfy the conditions. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions in the question.
2. Understand the implications of the given conditions on the panel composition.
3. Analyze the impact of selecting G and H on the possible selections for F, K, and M.
4. Determine which scientists must be included or excluded based on the given conditions.
5. Choose the answer that aligns with your deductions.

Advice:
- Carefully read and understand all the given conditions.
- Identify the key scientists mentioned in each condition and their relationships.
- Consider the impact of each condition individually and in combination.
- Systematically apply the conditions to deduce the implications for panel composition.
- Avoid making assumptions or inferences that are not directly supported by the given conditions.
