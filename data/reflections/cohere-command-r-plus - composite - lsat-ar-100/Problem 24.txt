Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooked constraint impact
- Conditional relationship

Solution:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must be assigned. This implies a direct link between these two candidates. 

Choice [REDACTED] states that Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned. This also ensures a similar effect because it indirectly links Jaramillo and Kayne. If Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be, which means Kayne must be assigned due to the original constraint. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the current ambassador assignments and constraints. 
2. Identify the conditional relationships between candidates mentioned in the question. 
3. Determine how each choice would impact the assignments, considering all constraints. 
4. Assess which choice, when substituted for the original constraint, maintains the same overall effect on ambassador assignments. 

Advice:
 - Carefully consider the impact of each constraint and choice on the overall ambassador assignments. 
 - Recognize the conditional relationships between candidates and how they influence each other's assignments. 
 - Avoid focusing solely on direct relationships and consider indirect implications as well. 
 - Always refer back to the original constraints to ensure your interpretation aligns with the question's context.
