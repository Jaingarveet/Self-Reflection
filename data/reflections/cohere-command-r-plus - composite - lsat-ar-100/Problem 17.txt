Solution:
Given: 
- Day 1: Greyhound
- No breed is featured on two consecutive days.
- Day 1 breeds are not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, excluding day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured with Himalayans or on day 7.

Deductions: 
- Day 1: Greyhound (given)
- Day 2, 4, or 6: Himalayan (must appear on 3 non-consecutive days)
- Day 7: Cannot be Greyhound or Himalayan (given)

Now, we can evaluate the options: 
- [REDACTED]: Day 1 and Day 3: Possible, as they are two days apart, and no breed is featured on two consecutive days.
- [REDACTED]: Day 2 and Day 6: Impossible because these days both likely feature Himalayans, and no breed is featured on two consecutive days.
- [REDACTED]: Day 3 and Day 5: Possible, as they are two days apart, and no breed is featured on two consecutive days.
- [REDACTED]: Day 4 and Day 6: Possible, as they are two days apart, and no breed is featured on two consecutive days.
- [REDACTED]: Day 5 and Day 7: Possible, as they are two days apart, and no breed is featured on two consecutive days.

The correct answer is [REDACTED].
