Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and build the schedule step by step: 

1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, so we place him on Tuesday. 
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. We can schedule them for morning slots. 
3. Nina's report: if given, Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, unless it's Wednesday. This means Nina can be scheduled for Monday or Tuesday, with Helen and Irving on Tuesday or Wednesday, respectively. 
4. We have some flexibility with the remaining students, Kyle and Lenore. 

[REDACTED] possible schedule that meets all the conditions is: 

Monday morning: Lenore
Monday afternoon: Helen
Tuesday morning: George (only option)
Tuesday afternoon: Irving
Wednesday morning: Nina
Wednesday afternoon: Robert

This schedule ensures that exactly six students give reports over three days, with two reports each day. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions provided in the question. 
2. Identify the non-negotiable conditions first (e.g., George on Tuesday, no afternoon reports for Olivia or Robert). 
3. Focus on the conditions related to Nina's report and the subsequent impact on Helen and Irving's reports. 
4. Build the schedule step by step, ensuring that each condition is met. 
5. Double-check that the final schedule includes all six students and adheres to the morning/afternoon and consecutive-day requirements. 

Advice:
 - Read and re-read the conditions to ensure you fully understand them. 
 - Identify the non-negotiable conditions and build the schedule around them. 
 - Pay close attention to the impact of each student's report on the following day's schedule. 
 - Stay organized by creating a table or list to allocate students to specific time slots. 
 - Double-check your final schedule to ensure it meets all the criteria.
