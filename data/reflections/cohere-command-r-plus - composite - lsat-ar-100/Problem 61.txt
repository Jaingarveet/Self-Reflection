Solution:
The constraints state that if Landon is assigned as an ambassador, it must be to Zambia. However, this does not mean that Landon will definitely be assigned an ambassadorship. The correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], states that [REDACTED] This cannot be true because if Landon is not assigned to Zambia, then Novetzke also cannot be, as this would violate the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints:
    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both.
    - If Jaramillo, then Kayne.
    - If Ong to Venezuela, then not Kayne to Yemen.
    - If Landon, then to Zambia.
2. Identify the implications and possibilities:
    - Kayne and Novetzke cannot both be assigned.
    - If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
    - Ong and Kayne can be assigned, but not to Venezuela and Yemen, respectively.
    - Landon can be assigned, but only to Zambia.
3. Evaluate each choice for its truth potential:
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it satisfies Jaramillo-Kayne and leaves other assignments open.
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it satisfies the Kayne-Novetzke constraint and leaves other assignments open.
    - [REDACTED]: Not possible, as it violates Kayne-Novetzke and Landon-Zambia constraints.
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it leaves all assignments open except for Landon.
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it leaves all assignments open except for Ong.
4. Choose the answer that presents a situation that cannot be true.

Advice:
- Read and understand all constraints carefully.
- Identify implications and possibilities based on the constraints.
- Evaluate each choice systematically and individually.
- Avoid making assumptions beyond the given constraints.
- Consider all possibilities and their implications before reaching a conclusion.
