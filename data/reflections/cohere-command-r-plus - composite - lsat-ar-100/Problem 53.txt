Solution:
The given rules and constraints are as follows: 
- J must be shown in the evening. 
- K cannot be shown in the morning. 
- L must be shown after K and before M. 

From these rules, we can deduce the following: 
- J is shown in the evening, which is the only option for its showing time. 
- K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. 
- L must be shown after K, which narrows down its options to the afternoon or evening. 
- M must be shown after L. As L can only be shown in the afternoon or evening, this means that M can only be shown in the evening (after L) or afternoon (if L is shown in the evening). 

Now, let's consider the options: 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not a must; K can be shown in the afternoon, depending on the showing time of J. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This must be true because L has to be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning. If K is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown afterward in the same time slot. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not a must as L can also be shown in the afternoon, maintaining the relative order with K. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This cannot be true because M can only be shown after L, and L cannot be shown in the morning due to the constraint on K. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not a must as M can also be shown in the evening, depending on when L is shown. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] 

Instructions:
- Identify the given rules and constraints regarding the showing order of the houses. 
- Interpret the rules accurately, paying close attention to the specific requirements for each house. 
- Consider all the options for the showing times of J, K, and L, as they are interconnected. 
- Deduce the possible showing times for M based on the constraints imposed by L. 
- Evaluate each choice carefully, considering the must-be-true condition. 

Advice:
- Read and understand the rules and constraints carefully. 
- Break down complex rules into simpler components to facilitate understanding. 
- Consider the implications of each rule and how they interact with each other. 
- Create a logical framework that accounts for all the rules and their implications. 
- Avoid making rushed conclusions; thoroughly evaluate all options before selecting an answer. 
- Double-check your interpretation of the rules to ensure accuracy.
