Solution: Given that Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, we can place Parra and Quinn in Zone 1, and Tiao in Zone 2 (satisfying the condition that Tiao can work in Zone 2). This leaves Udall to work in Zone 2 as well, and the remaining representatives, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey, in Zone 3. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions provided in the question. 
2. Visually organize the conditions using a table or diagram to help understand the relationships. 
3. Analyze each choice, step-by-step, by comparing it to the conditions. 
4. Eliminate choices that contradict the conditions. 
5. Identify the choice that satisfies all conditions or the most conditions, if a perfect match is not found. 

Advice:
 - Create a visual representation of the conditions to help identify relationships and eliminate choices. 
 - Analyze each choice systematically, step-by-step, rather than trying to solve the problem mentally all at once. 
 - Ensure you fully understand each condition before making eliminations or selections. 
 - Remember that logical deductions should be based on the information given, not on assumptions or external knowledge. 
 - Double-check your interpretation of negative conditions ("not both") to avoid oversight.
