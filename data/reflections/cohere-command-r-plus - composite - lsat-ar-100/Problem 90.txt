Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conditions for setting the service targets and overlooked the fact that none of the clients could have a website target longer than their voicemail target. I focused solely on the conditions related to Image and Solide and missed the broader constraint.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooked constraint
- Incomplete analysis

Solution:

The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target longer than their voicemail target. This immediately rules out choice [REDACTED], as [REDACTED] would violate this condition for all clients.

Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients, so it must be set at 1 day. This means that Image's website target should be set at 2 days to satisfy the condition that the website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target.

Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's. If we set Solide's website target at 2 days, we can set Truvest's website target at 3 days, satisfying the condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Read and understand the conditions for setting the service targets carefully.
2. Identify the constraints and relationships between the clients' targets.
3. Start eliminating choices that violate the conditions:
   - Choice [REDACTED] can be eliminated as it violates the condition that website targets cannot be longer than voicemail targets.
4. Assign targets based on the remaining conditions:
   - Image must have the shortest voicemail target, so assign it a 1-day voicemail target.
   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's, so assign Solide [REDACTED] and Truvest [REDACTED].
5. Review the choices and identify which target cannot be set for more than one client:
   - Choice [REDACTED] is the only option that violates the conditions for all clients.

Advice:
- Read and understand the conditions thoroughly before making any decisions.
- Identify all constraints and relationships between the options to avoid overlooking critical information.
- Start by eliminating choices that clearly violate the conditions to narrow down the possibilities.
- Assign targets systematically, ensuring that each assignment satisfies the conditions and constraints.
- Review your choices and identify patterns or unique options that stand out as unlikely to be correct.
