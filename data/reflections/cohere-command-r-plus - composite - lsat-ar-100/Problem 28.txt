Solution:
[REDACTED]iven the conditions: 
- F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected.
- [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected.
- If [REDACTED] is selected, [REDACTED] and R must also be selected.
- The panel must include at least one of each type of scientist.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then no more than one zoologist is selected. 

We are provided with four selected scientists: F, L, Q, and R. 

F is a botanist, so we already have one botanist on the panel. Q is a zoologist, so we have one zoologist as well. This leaves the chemist position to be filled by either [REDACTED] or L, as [REDACTED] cannot be selected without also selecting [REDACTED] and R, which would result in two zoologists (Q and R) and violate the given conditions. 

Therefore, the fifth scientist selected must be [REDACTED], as they complete the required trio of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and R, and L does not have any selection restrictions. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given selected scientists.
2. Identify the types of scientists on the panel based on the provided conditions and selections. 
3. Determine the restrictions and relationships between the scientists' types. 
4. Analyze the impact of the provided selections on the conditions. 
5. Identify which conditions are already satisfied by the provided selections. 
6. Determine which scientist must be selected to satisfy the remaining conditions. 
7. Ensure that your selected scientist does not violate any conditions. 

Advice:
- Read and understand all the conditions and their implications before making a decision. 
- Identify the types of scientists involved and their relationships based on the conditions. 
- Carefully interpret the conditions, especially those with multiple clauses, to understand their individual and combined impacts. 
- Consider all provided selections and their implications on the conditions. 
- Ensure that your selected scientist satisfies all necessary conditions without violating any restrictions.
