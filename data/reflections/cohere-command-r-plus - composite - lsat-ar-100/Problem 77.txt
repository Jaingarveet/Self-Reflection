- Rule misunderstanding

Solution:
Let's re-examine the rules and the options for each employee: 
- Robertson must be assigned one of the first [REDACTED] spaces (#1 to #4). This means that [REDACTED] of these [REDACTED] spaces will be taken, leaving the remaining [REDACTED] employees with more flexibility. 
- Young must have a higher number than Togowa. If Togowa is assigned #1, it doesn't restrict Young's options; Young could still be assigned any of the remaining [REDACTED] spaces (#2 to #6). 
- Xu must have a higher number than Souza, but this rule doesn't limit their options significantly. 

Now, let's consider Young, Xu, and Souza: 
- Young has [REDACTED] options if Togowa takes #1 (#2 to #6). 
- Xu has [REDACTED] options if Souza takes #1 or #2. 
- Souza has [REDACTED] options if Xu takes any space from #1 to #4. 

Therefore, at most, [REDACTED] employees (Robertson, Young, Xu, and Souza) are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces each. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the fixed starting point: Robertson must be assigned #1 to #4. 
2. Understand the conditions for Young, Xu, and Souza in relation to other employees' assignments. 
3. Consider the best-case scenario for Young, Xu, and Souza, where their options are most flexible. 
4. Count the number of employees with limited options. 

Advice:
- Understand the rules and conditions thoroughly. Ensure you interpret "must be higher/lower" as providing flexibility rather than strict limitations. 
- Consider the most flexible scenarios first, as these will provide the lower bound for the number of possible options. 
- Systematically work through each employee's options, considering the impact of each possible assignment on the remaining employees.
