Solution:

Given constraints: 
- No batches on Wednesday
- At least one batch on Monday
- Second oatmeal = first peanut butter
- Second sugar on Thursday

Let's assign cookie types to days: 
- Monday: 1st oatmeal, 1st peanut butter, 1st sugar
- Tuesday: 2nd oatmeal, 2nd peanut butter, 3rd sugar
- Friday: 3rd oatmeal, 3rd peanut butter

This assignment ensures no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day and fulfills the given constraints. 

Now, we can evaluate the choices: 
[REDACTED]: Tuesday has three batches, but this isn't a necessity; it could be two batches on Tuesday and one on Friday.
[REDACTED]: Friday has two batches, fulfilling the requirement of three batches per week for each kind.
[REDACTED]: Monday has three batches, but this isn't a must; it could vary depending on the assignment.
[REDACTED]: Thursday has two batches, the second sugar, and either the third oatmeal or peanut butter.
[REDACTED]: Monday has one batch, and Tuesday could have two or three batches.

The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] 

Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints and conditions provided in the question. 
2. Assign cookie types to days, ensuring no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. 
3. Evaluate each choice based on the cookie type assignments. 
4. Identify the choice that must be true based on the assignments and constraints. 

Advice:
 - Carefully read and understand the constraints and conditions. 
 - Avoid making assumptions; work with the given information. 
 - Systematically assign cookie types to days while adhering to the conditions. 
 - Consider all options and evaluate them based on the assignments. 
 - Look for patterns or relationships between cookie types and days to help with assignments. 
 - Double-check your assignments against the constraints to ensure they are valid.
