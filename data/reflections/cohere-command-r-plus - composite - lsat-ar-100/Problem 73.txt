Solution: Given that Kramer and O'Neill both review "Tamerlane," and exactly three students review "Undulation," we can deduce the following:

- Lopez and Megregian cannot review "Tamerlane" as it would result in three students having the same play in common, contradicting the clue that there should only be pairs.
- This leaves "Sunset" to be reviewed by Kramer and Lopez, ensuring that Megregian and Jiang can take the remaining spots for "Undulation."
- Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: O'Neill reviews Sunset, along with Kramer.

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions and constraints from the context.
2. Interpret the conditions correctly, especially the one stating "exactly two students review the same play or plays."
3. Deduce the possible combinations of play reviews for each student.
4. Eliminate options that contradict the given conditions.
5. Choose the answer that aligns with the deductions.

Advice:
- Read and understand the context and question carefully.
- Break down the conditions and constraints into manageable components.
- Avoid making assumptions or overgeneralizing.
- Consider all possibilities and apply logical deduction systematically.
- Double-check your interpretations and deductions to ensure they align with the given conditions.
