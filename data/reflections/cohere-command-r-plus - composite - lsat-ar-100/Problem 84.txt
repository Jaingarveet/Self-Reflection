Solution:
The conditions state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, eliminating choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. 

The condition, "F is placed on the same shelf as M," means that F and M must be on the same shelf. As a result, the only option that satisfies this condition is choice [REDACTED], with F, H, and M on the bottom shelf. 

The prompt also states that there must be at least two books on each shelf, and there are no restrictions that would prevent two books from being placed on the bottom shelf. 

Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions provided in the prompt and list them clearly. 
2. Interpret each condition carefully and systematically. 
3. Eliminate choices that violate any of the conditions. 
4. Pay close attention to detail and ensure you don't overlook any conditions or details. 
5. Double-check your interpretation and reasoning for each step. 

Advice:
- Always read and re-read the conditions and choices carefully. 
- Break down complex conditions into simpler components. 
- Systematically apply each condition to the choices. 
- Avoid making rushed assumptions or interpretations. 
- Maintain a clear and organized thought process. 
- Regularly review and reflect on your reasoning to identify any potential oversights or misinterpretations.
