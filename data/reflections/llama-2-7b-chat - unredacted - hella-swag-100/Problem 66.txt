  Great job! You have correctly identified the most likely completion to the text. Here's a breakdown of why you chose the correct answer:

You recognized that the text describes the classic pasteurella infection discharge in rabbits as a thick, creamy white discharge from the nostrils. You then eliminated options A and C, which do not match this description. You also eliminated option B, which mentions a yellow or reddish colored discharge that does not appear bloody, warm to the touch, or foul smelling. This leaves option D, which mentions the discharge can be anything from watery to white to yellow, but does not provide any specific information about the color or consistency of the discharge.

Overall, your reasoning and decision-making were spot on, and you correctly identified the most likely completion to the text. Great job!
