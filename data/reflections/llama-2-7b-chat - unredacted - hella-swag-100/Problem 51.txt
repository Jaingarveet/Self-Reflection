 Explanation:
I misinterpreted the context of the text and the likely completion to the drill. I thought the drill was related to a different activity, such as rock paper scissors, rather than the actual completion of the hurling drill.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation

Solution:
The text describes a drill for a Hurling team where the players form an "X" shape and throw the ball diagonally across to each other.
