 Explanation:
I misinterpreted the context of the situation and made an incorrect choice. I thought the text was describing a different process for making lemonade, but it is actually describing the steps for making lemonade.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation
* Contextual confusion
* Incorrect assumptions

Solution:
The correct completion to the text is "B: are filled with ice and poured afterwards." This is the most likely step in the process of making lemonade, as it involves adding ice to the glasses after the hot water is poured over the lemons.

Instructions:

1. Read the text carefully and identify the actions described.
2. Consider the context of making lemonade and the steps involved.
3. Choose the most likely completion to the text based on the context and actions described.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.

Advice:

* Always read the text carefully and consider the context in which it is being used.
* Pay attention to the actions described in the text and use common sense to determine the most likely completion.
* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy and avoid making assumptions.
* Use critical thinking skills to evaluate the context and make an informed decision.
