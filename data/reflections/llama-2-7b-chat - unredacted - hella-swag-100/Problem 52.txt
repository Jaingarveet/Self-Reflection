  My apologies for the mistake. Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("B")

The correct answer is (B) Do your research on different topics to help inform your opinions. This answer choice suggests that individuals should gather information and evidence to support their views, rather than simply following the crowd. By doing their research, individuals can make informed decisions and stand up for their opinions, even if they are different from what others think.
