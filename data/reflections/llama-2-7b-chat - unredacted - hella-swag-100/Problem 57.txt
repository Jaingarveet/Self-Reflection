  Excellent! You have correctly identified the most likely completion to the text. Here's a breakdown of why option B is the best choice:

The text provides information about different types of frosting tips and their effects on the appearance of the frosting. It mentions that a wilton 2d closed star tip creates a ruffled appearance, while a wilton 1 m open star tip gives a smoother look. However, the text does not provide any information about having multiple different cupcake designs in one shot.

Option B is the most logical conclusion because it suggests that having multiple different cupcake designs in one shot can create a more conspicuous overall appearance. This is in line with the information provided in the text about the different types of tips and their effects on the frosting. It makes sense that having multiple designs in one shot would create a more noticeable appearance, as it would provide a visual contrast between the different cupcakes.
