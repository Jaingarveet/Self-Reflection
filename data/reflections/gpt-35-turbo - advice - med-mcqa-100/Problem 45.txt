Advice:

 - If the question is unclear or lacks information, try to make an informed guess based on your knowledge.
 - If you do not know the answer, choose "None of the Above" or leave the question unanswered.
 - If you are unsure about your answer, double-check the information and reasoning before submitting your answer.
 - Remember that guessing is not a reliable strategy for answering questions.
