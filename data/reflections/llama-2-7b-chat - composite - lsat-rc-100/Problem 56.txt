Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

The reference to railroads in the passage serves to highlight the difficulty economists faced in trying to incorporate the concept of the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought. The passage states that "many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads" (emphasis added). The reference to railroads is used to illustrate the challenge of mathematically representing the concept of the Pin Factory, which was seen as a major obstacle in incorporating it into economic theory.

Therefore, option (D) is the best answer. Options (A) and (C) are not supported by the passage, and option (B) is partially correct, as the reference to railroads does [REDACTED], but it also serves to highlight the broader challenge of incorporating the Pin Factory into economic theory. Option (E) is not relevant to the passage.
