Explanation:
The passage mentions several ways in which insects can adapt when a plant develops defenses against them. One of these ways is to evolve a way to circumvent the plants' defenses, which is mentioned in option (D) "[REDACTED]."

However, the passage does not mention option (A) "[REDACTED]" as a way in which insects can adapt. While it is true that insects may switch to other food sources when a plant develops defenses against them, this is not the specific adaptation mentioned in the passage.

Similarly, options (B) and (C) are not mentioned in the passage as ways in which insects can adapt. Option (B) "[REDACTED]" is mentioned in the passage as a way in which insects may avoid plants with defenses, but not as a way in which they can adapt to defenses that have already developed. Option (C) "[REDACTED]" is not mentioned in the passage at all.

Therefore, the best answer is option (D) "[REDACTED]."
