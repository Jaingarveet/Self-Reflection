Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the specific train and timing conditions. 
 - Understand the probability calculation required: catching the first train is not the same as catching any train. 
 - Consider the timing of the first trains and the time intervals between subsequent trains. 
 - Practice similar probability problems to improve your interpretation skills and calculation accuracy. 
 - Always double-check your interpretation of the problem and your calculations.
