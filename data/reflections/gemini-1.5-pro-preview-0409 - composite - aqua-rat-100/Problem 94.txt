Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the letters in the bike number needed to be distinct, which is not specified in the problem. This led me to use combinations for the letters instead of permutations.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of problem
 - Assumption error
 - Combination vs. Permutation error
Solution:
We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition allowed) out of 26, and then 2 digits out of 10.
Number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition) = 26 * 26 = 676 
Number of ways to choose 2 digits = 10 * 10 = 100
Total number of distinct bike numbers = 676 * 100 = 67600 
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify if repetition is allowed or not.
2. Determine if order matters (permutation) or not (combination).
3. Calculate the number of ways to choose letters and numbers based on the correct counting method (permutation or combination).
4. Multiply the number of ways to choose letters by the number of ways to choose numbers to get the total number of distinct bike numbers.
5. Verify your answer against the available choices.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to whether repetition is allowed or not in counting problems.
 - Clearly distinguish between permutations (order matters) and combinations (order doesn't matter).
 - When in doubt, consider a small example to understand the counting principle involved.
 - Always double-check your calculations and ensure your answer aligns with the problem's requirements.
