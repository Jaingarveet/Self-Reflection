Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the key difference between Eppie and Silas's gold. 
I focused on the physical characteristics of the gold, such as its durability and protection, instead of its symbolic meaning. 
The passage emphasizes Eppie's vitality and her ability to bring joy and change into Silas's life, in contrast to the gold's static and isolating nature.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of symbolism
 - Focus on physical characteristics instead of symbolic meaning
 - Failure to identify key difference between characters
Solution:
Eppie is portrayed as a creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements. 
Silas's gold is described as needing nothing and being deaf to the song of birds. 
Eppie brings joy and change into Silas's life, while the gold keeps him isolated and unchanging.
