## Reflection on Incorrect Answer to English Question
**Explanation:**
My initial response to the question was incorrect because I focused solely on the first sentence of Passage 1, which states that women hold a subordinate position to men. This led me to mistakenly believe that the entire passage argued for the inferiority of women. However, upon further analysis, I realized that the passage actually emphasizes the importance and significance of women's roles, despite their subordinate position.
**Error Keywords:**

* **Overgeneralization:** I generalized the statement about women's subordinate position to encompass their entire role in society.
* **Lack of Contextual Analysis:** I failed to consider the broader context of the passage and the author's overall argument.
**Solution:**
1. **Read the entire passage carefully:** I should have read the entire passage to understand the author's full argument and avoid misinterpreting isolated statements.
