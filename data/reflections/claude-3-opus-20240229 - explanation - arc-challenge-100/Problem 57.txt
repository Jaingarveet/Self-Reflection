Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the change in leaf color during autumn is solely influenced by environmental factors. While environmental factors like temperature and light do play a role, the ability to change leaf color is actually an inherited trait. The genes of the tree determine its ability to break down chlorophyll and reveal other pigments in response to seasonal changes.
