Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the best answer, even though both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] correctly describe characteristics of a mixture. The question asked for the statement that describes why the snack is a mixture, and while [REDACTED] is true, it doesn't provide the reasoning. Option [REDACTED] gives the key reason - the components in a mixture retain their original properties. I focused too much on the number of substances rather than on the behavior of those substances in a mixture.
