Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the relative masses of the brick and air volumes. I calculated the masses correctly but failed to properly compare the magnitudes and identify the smallest value. My knowledge gap was not in the physics concepts or calculations, but rather in the final comparative analysis step.
