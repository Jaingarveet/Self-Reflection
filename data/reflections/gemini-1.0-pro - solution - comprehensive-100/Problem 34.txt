Solution:
The argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This implies that if the company moves to Ocean View, most employees will have to choose between living further away and having a longer commute or living closer and paying more for housing. The argument does not make any assumptions about the current commute times of Acme employees.
