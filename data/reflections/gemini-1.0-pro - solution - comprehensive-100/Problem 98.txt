Solution:
1. Identify the amino acid in question.
2. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED] or formed by post-translational modification.
3. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED], then aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required.
4. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, then aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is not required.
