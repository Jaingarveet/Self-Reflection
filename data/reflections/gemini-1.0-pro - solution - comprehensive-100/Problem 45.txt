Solution:
The passage states that Marshall and the NAACP "set up a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated."
The test case strategy is described as a "tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision."
This suggests that the test case strategy was not [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED].
The passage also states that the test case strategy was "[REDACTED]."
Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that the author views the test case strategy developed by Marshall as [REDACTED].
