Solution:
G is placed on the top shelf.
I is placed on the middle shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
F is placed on the same shelf as M.
More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
Therefore, the possible arrangements are:
Arrangement 1:
Top shelf: G
Middle shelf: [REDACTED]
Bottom shelf: F, H, M, O
Arrangement 2:
Top shelf: G
Middle shelf: [REDACTED]
Bottom shelf: F, H, K, M, O
Only arrangement 2 satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
