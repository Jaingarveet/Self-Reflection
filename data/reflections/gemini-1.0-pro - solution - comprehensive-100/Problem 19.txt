Solution:
The conclusion "friends are like dung" is absurd.
The statement "money is like dung" is a metaphor, not a logical statement.
The statement "friends are worth a thousand dollars" implies that friends have a monetary value.
If friends have a monetary value, then money is not like dung.
Therefore, if the conclusion "friends are like dung" is false, then the statement "money is like dung" must be false.
