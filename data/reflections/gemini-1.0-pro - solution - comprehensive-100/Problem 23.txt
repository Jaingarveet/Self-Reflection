Solution:
1. Identify the constraints:
    - Reynaldo cannot test F.
    - Yuki cannot test J.
    - Theresa must test H.
    - The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
2. Analyze each option:
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This violates the constraint that Reynaldo cannot test F.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This violates the constraint that Theresa must test H.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This violates the constraint that the bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible.
