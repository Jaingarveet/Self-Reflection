Solution:
1. Identify the given information:
    - Maximum speed: 700 m/s
    - Time to travel 700 m high: 40 seconds
    - Time to pass a point: 5 seconds
2. Calculate the actual speed:
    - Speed = Distance / Time
    - Speed = 700 m / 40 s
    - Speed = 17.5 m/s
3. Calculate the length of the space shuttle:
    - Length = Speed * Time (to pass a point)
    - Length = 17.5 m/s * 5 s
    - Length = 87.5 m
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length:
    - Answer: [REDACTED] ([REDACTED]) - closest to the calculated length of 87.5 m
