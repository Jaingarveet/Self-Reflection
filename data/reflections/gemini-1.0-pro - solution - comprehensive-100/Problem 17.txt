Solution:
The argument states that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with those around him.
The argument then provides an example of great painters who often spend most of their time in loneliness and have no intimate relationships.
The argument concludes that the psychological theory is untenable because it does not explain why great painters can be happy despite not having intimate relationships.
The argument assumes that great painters are happy.
