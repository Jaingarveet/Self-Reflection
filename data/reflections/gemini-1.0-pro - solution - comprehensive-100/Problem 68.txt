Solution:
The slope of the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ is $\frac{32-k}{k-2}$.
The line passes through the origin, which means it has a slope of $\frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}$.
To find the value of $k$ that makes the slope undefined, we set the denominator of the slope equation to zero.
$k-2=[REDACTED]$
$k=2$
However, $k=2$ is not a valid solution because it would make the denominator of the slope equation zero, resulting in an undefined slope.
Therefore, there is no value of $k$ that makes the slope of the line undefined.
