Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the perimeter. I correctly found the length and breadth, but when calculating the perimeter, I made an arithmetic error.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Perimeter calculation error
Solution:
Let's denote the breadth as x. Then the length is 4x + 1.
The area of the rectangle is length * breadth = 150 sq m, so x * (4x + 1) = 150.
Solving this equation gives x = 5 and 4x + 1 = 21.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + breadth), so the perimeter is 2 * (21 + 5) = 52 m.
Instructions:
1. Denote the breadth as x and the length as 4x + 1.
2. Set up the equation for the area of the rectangle: x * (4x + 1) = 150.
3. Solve this equation to find the values of x and 4x + 1.
4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula 2 * (length + breadth).
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Break down complex problems into simpler steps.
- Be careful with your calculations, especially when dealing with multiple steps.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 2 * (length + breadth).
