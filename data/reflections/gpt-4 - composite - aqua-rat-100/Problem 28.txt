Explanation:
I misunderstood the question. I calculated the probability of both events not occurring simultaneously, instead of finding the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. The question is asking for the maximum probability that either Stock [REDACTED] or Stock [REDACTED] will not increase in value, not the probability that both will not increase in value.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of question
- Probability calculation error
Solution:
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = [REDACTED].
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is the maximum of these two probabilities, which is 0.44.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question correctly. It's asking for the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur.
2. Calculate the probability that each event will not occur by subtracting the given probability from 1.
3. Identify the maximum of these two probabilities.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.
- Be careful with probability questions. They can be tricky and require careful thought.
- When dealing with multiple events, consider each event separately before combining them.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
