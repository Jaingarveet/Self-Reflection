Explanation:
I made a mistake in simplifying the expression. The correct simplification of the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) is x = n + 4, not x = n - 4. This led to an incorrect range for x.
Error Keywords:
- Simplification error
- Algebraic error
- Range calculation error
Solution:
The correct simplification of the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) is x = n + 4. 
So, if 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then 40 ≤ x ≤ 76. 
However, none of the given options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] fully cover this range. 
The closest option is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which partially covers the range of x.
Instructions:
1. Simplify the given expression correctly.
2. Substitute the given range of n into the simplified expression to find the range of x.
3. Compare the calculated range of x with the options given.
4. Choose the option that best fits the calculated range of x.
Advice:
- Always double-check your simplifications in algebraic expressions.
- Be careful when calculating ranges based on inequalities.
- Always verify your answer by substitifying the boundary values of the range into the simplified expression.
- If none of the options fully cover the calculated range, choose the option that best fits the range.
