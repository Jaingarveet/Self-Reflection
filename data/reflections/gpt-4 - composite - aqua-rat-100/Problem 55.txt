Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't notice that there were two options with the same numerical value but different letters. I chose option [REDACTED], but the correct answer was [REDACTED]. This was a mistake in option selection, not in calculation.
Error Keywords:
- Option selection error
- Attention to detail
Solution:
The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current's speed is 4 - 2 = 2 kmph. 
When the man rows along the current, his speed is his speed in still water plus the speed of the current. So, his speed along the current is 4 + 2 = [REDACTED]. The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the man's speed in still water.
2. Identify the man's speed against the current.
3. Subtract the man's speed against the current from his speed in still water to find the speed of the current.
4. Add the man's speed in still water to the speed of the current to find his speed along the current.
5. Check all the options carefully before selecting the answer.
Advice:
- Always read the question and all the options carefully.
- Pay attention to detail, especially when there are options with the same numerical value but different letters.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Be careful not to rush through the problem, take your time to understand the question and the options.
