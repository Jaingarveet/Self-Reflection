Explanation:
I misunderstood the question. The question stated that the team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, not that they won [REDACTED]% of their matches. This led me to incorrectly calculate the total number of matches and the number of lost matches. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Percentage calculation error
- Total number calculation error
Solution:
The team won 20 matches and lost [REDACTED]% of their matches. 
Let's denote the total number of matches as X. 
So, [REDACTED]% of X equals 20 (because if they lost [REDACTED]% then they won [REDACTED]%). 
We can write this as 0.[REDACTED]X = 20. 
Solving for X gives X = 20 / 0.[REDACTED] = approximately 28.[REDACTED][REDACTED]. 
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this up to 29 matches. 
So, the team lost [REDACTED]% of 29 matches, which is approximately 8.[REDACTED] matches. 
Again, since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this down to 8 matches. 
But the closest answer choice is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and identify the given information.
2. Identify the total number of matches as X.
[REDACTED]. Write an equation based on the given information.
4. Solve the equation for X.
[REDACTED]. Calculate the number of lost matches by multiplying the total number of matches by the loss percentage.
6. Round the number of lost matches to the nearest whole number.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Be careful with percentages and how they are used in the question.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember to round your answer to the nearest whole number when necessary.
- If your calculated answer is not an option, choose the closest answer.
