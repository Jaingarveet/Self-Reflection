Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the system of equations. I must have made an arithmetic error while solving the equations, which led to the incorrect answer.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Solving system of equations error
Solution:
Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as [REDACTED] and the amount of money Sajal has as S. 
From the first condition, we have the equation: S + 30 = 2([REDACTED] - 30).
From the second condition, we have the equation: [REDACTED] + 10 = 3(S - 10).
Solving these two equations, we get:
S = 2[REDACTED] - 60 and [REDACTED] = 3S - 30.
Substituting the value of S from the first equation into the second, we get:
[REDACTED] = 3(2[REDACTED] - 60) - 30.
Solving this equation, we get [REDACTED] = 62.
Substituting [REDACTED] = 62 into the first equation, we get S = 34.
Instructions:
1. Identify the unknowns and denote them with variables.
2. Translate the problem conditions into equations.
3. Solve the system of equations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
