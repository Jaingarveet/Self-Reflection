Explanation:
I made a sign error when substituting the value of y back into the first equation. This led to an incorrect value for x and ultimately the wrong solution.
Error Keywords:
 - Sign error
 - Substitution error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
Following the initial steps correctly:
1. We multiplied the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\ 6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
2. We added the two equations together: 
$$10y = -80$$
3. We solved for y:
$$y = -8$$
4. Now, substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
5. Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).
Instructions:
1. Choose a variable to eliminate by manipulating one or both equations.
2. Multiply one or both equations by appropriate constants to achieve the same coefficient for the chosen variable with opposite signs.
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the value of the found variable back into one of the original equations.
6. Solve for the other variable, paying close attention to signs during calculations.
7. Write the solution as an ordered pair (x, y).
8. Double-check your solution by substituting both values back into both original equations to ensure they hold true.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to signs when manipulating equations and performing calculations.
 - Double-check your work at each step, especially when substituting values back into equations.
 - Consider using different methods (substitution, graphing) to verify your solution if unsure. 
 - Practice solving systems of equations regularly to improve accuracy and speed.
