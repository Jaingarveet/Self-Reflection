Explanation:
I incorrectly applied the concept of inverse proportionality. I mistakenly assumed that if the number of men increases, the number of days required to complete the work would decrease proportionally. However, the correct relationship is inversely proportional, meaning that if the number of men increases, the number of days required to complete the work would decrease inversely.
