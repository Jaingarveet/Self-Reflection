Explanation:
I made a mistake in interpreting the problem statement. I assumed that the cost of each white sharpener was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener, but the problem statement actually says that the cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. This led me to an incorrect equation and an impossible solution.
