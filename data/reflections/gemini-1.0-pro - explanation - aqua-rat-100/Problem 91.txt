Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the north and south movements would cancel each other out, resulting in a net movement of [REDACTED] east. However, the problem states that [REDACTED] travels [REDACTED] north, which means they end up [REDACTED] north of their starting point. Therefore, the north and south movements do not cancel each other out, and [REDACTED] is actually [REDACTED] north of their starting point.
