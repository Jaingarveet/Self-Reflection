## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on identifying individual factors that could contribute to an unstable lie, rather than considering the specific context of the question. While all the listed choices (oligohydramnios, placenta previa, pelvic tumor, and uterine anomalies) can potentially cause an unstable lie, the question explicitly mentions a multigravida with previous normal deliveries. This information suggests a higher likelihood of **placenta previa** as the cause of the unstable lie in this specific case.
**Error Keywords:**
* Contextual misunderstanding
* Incomplete analysis
* Overgeneralization
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the specific context:** The question mentions a multigravida with previous normal deliveries experiencing an unstable lie.
2. **Analyze the context:** Multigravida indicates multiple pregnancies, and previous normal deliveries suggest a competent uterus and pelvis. This reduces the likelihood of uterine anomalies or pelvic tumors as the primary cause.
3. **Consider individual factors:** Evaluate each remaining option (oligohydramnios and placenta previa) in the context of the specific scenario.
4. **Reasoning for Placenta Previa:** Placenta previa is more likely in subsequent pregnancies, especially with a history of normal deliveries, as the lower uterine segment is more susceptible to placental implantation. Additionally, placenta previa can directly cause an unstable lie by blocking the baby's head from engaging in the pelvis.
5. **Conclusion:** Based on the context and analysis, placenta previa is the most likely cause of the unstable lie in this case.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. Carefully read and understand the entire question, including specific details and context.
2. Analyze the context to identify relevant information and potential biases.
3. Consider all possible options, but prioritize those most likely based on the context.
4. Use logical reasoning and evidence-based knowledge to support your conclusions.
5. Be mindful of potential biases and overgeneralizations.
6. Double-check your answer and ensure it aligns with the specific scenario presented.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* Focus on understanding the specific context and patient history.
* Prioritize evidence-based knowledge and logical reasoning over assumptions or generalizations.
* Consider all potential factors but weigh them based on their relevance to the specific scenario.
* Be cautious of potential biases and avoid jumping to conclusions.
* Double-check your answers and ensure they are consistent with the presented information.
By following these steps and reflecting on my mistakes, I can improve my accuracy in answering similar questions in the future.
