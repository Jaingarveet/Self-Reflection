## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly answered the question because I lacked the specific information needed to identify the correct answer. The question did not provide enough context about the mental health program, such as its name, location, or target population. Without this information, it was impossible to determine when the program was started.
**Error Keywords:**
* Lack of information
* Insufficient context
* Ambiguous question
* Unclear details
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the specific mental health program:** The question should clearly state the name, location, or target population of the program.
2. **Gather relevant information:** Research the program to determine its starting date. This may involve consulting official websites, news articles, or other reliable sources.
3. **Consider the geographical context:** If the question does not specify the country or region, research mental health programs in the relevant area to determine the typical starting dates for such programs.
4. **Provide a clear and concise answer:** Once the starting date is determined, provide a definitive answer in the format requested by the question.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. **Always request additional information if the question is unclear or ambiguous.**
2. **Conduct thorough research to gather relevant information before answering.**
3. **Consider the geographical context when answering questions about specific programs or initiatives.**
4. **Provide clear and concise answers that are supported by evidence.**
