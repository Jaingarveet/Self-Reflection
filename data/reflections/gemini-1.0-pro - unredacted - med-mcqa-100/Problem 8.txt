## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the concept of "randomness" without considering the additional information provided by the phrase "randomization implies." While randomness indeed implies unknown chances, the act of randomization specifically aims to create **equal** chances for each possible outcome.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation of "randomization implies"
* Focus on randomness alone
* Neglecting the concept of equal chances
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the key terms:** "randomization" and "chances."
2. **Understand the meaning of "randomization":** It is a process that ensures each outcome has an equal probability of occurring.
3. **Combine the concepts:** Randomization implies that the chances are both **equal** and **unknown**.
4. Choose the answer that reflects this understanding.
