## Reflection on Incorrect Answer: Type 2 Etched Enamel Pattern
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the "honeycomb-like" description of Type 2 etched enamel, neglecting other important characteristics. While the honeycomb pattern is indeed a feature, it's not the defining characteristic for this type. 
**Error Keywords:**
* **Overgeneralization:** Focusing on a single aspect (honeycomb) and neglecting other defining features.
* **Incomplete knowledge:** Lack of understanding of the full range of characteristics associated with Type 2 etched enamel.
* **Misinterpretation:** Mistakenly equating "honeycomb" with "cobblestone" pattern.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the specific type of etched enamel:** The question clearly states "Type 2."
2. **Recall the key characteristics of Type 2 etched enamel:** These include a cobblestone-like appearance, with irregular, shallow depressions separated by sharp, raised ridges.
3. **Compare the characteristics to the answer choices:** Only option C ("Cobblestone pattern") accurately reflects the defining feature of Type 2 etched enamel.
4. **Choose the answer that aligns with the recalled characteristics:** Answer C is the correct choice.
