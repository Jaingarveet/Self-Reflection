Solution:
Let $x$ be the number of students in the class. We are given that $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + [REDACTED]$. 

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: 
$x = [REDACTED]$. This is incorrect, as it does not satisfy the second equation. 

Correct Solution: 
Starting with the first equation, we can solve for $n$ to find: 
$n = 3x + 5$. 

Substituting this into the second equation gives: 
$4x + 5 = 3x + 5 + [REDACTED]$. 

Simplifying and solving for $x$: 
$x = 10$, which satisfies both equations. 

Now we can find $n$: 
$n = 3x + 5 = 35$. 

With $n$ milliliters of solution, Mr. Kohl can give each of the $10$ students $4$ milliliters, with $5$ milliliters left over.
