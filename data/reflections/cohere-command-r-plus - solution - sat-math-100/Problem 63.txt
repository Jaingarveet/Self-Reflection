Solution:

Given: 
- Total cost of television ($T$) = $\$300$
- Initial payment ($I$) = $\$60$
- Weekly payment ($P$) = $\$30$
- Number of weekly payments ($w$) is what we need to find. 

We know that the total cost of the television is the sum of the initial payment and the weekly payments multiplied by the number of weeks: 
$T = I + P \times w$ 

Plugging in the values: 
$300 = 60 + 30w$ 

Now, we need to isolate $w$ to find the number of weekly payments. 

$240 = 30w$ 

Dividing both sides by $30$, we get: 
$w = 8$ 

Therefore, the correct equation is $300 = 60 + 30w$, which can be rearranged to $300 = 30w + 60$, choice [REDACTED].
