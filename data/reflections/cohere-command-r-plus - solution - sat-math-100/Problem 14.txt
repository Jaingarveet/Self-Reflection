Solution:

The table shows that as x increases by 3a, y decreases by a. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. 

The equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: 

$2x - 3y = 0 \times 5a$. 

Multiplying by 5a gives: 

$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \times a$, or $x + 2y = a$.
