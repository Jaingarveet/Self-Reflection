Solution:

The equation $h=-4.9t^2 + 25t$ describes the height of the ball over time. We want to find when the ball hits the ground, i.e., when $h=0$. 

Setting $h=0$, we get:
$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$

Using the quadratic formula:
$t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Plugging in the values:
$t = \frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{25^2 - 4 \cdot -4.9 \cdot 0}}{2 \cdot -4.9} = \frac{-25 \pm 25}{2 \cdot -4.9} = -50/(-9.8) \approx 5.10$ seconds

Now, we consider the context: the ball is launched upward, so the relevant solution is the positive one, approximately $5.10$ seconds. This is closer to $[REDACTED]$ seconds, so the correct answer is **D**.
