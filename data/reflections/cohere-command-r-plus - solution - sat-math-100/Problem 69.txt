Solution:
 - Alan currently drives $100$ miles per week and wants to save $\$5$ on gasoline. 
 - Gasoline costs $\$4$ per gallon, and his car's mileage is $25$ miles per gallon. 
 - To determine how many fewer miles he should drive, we need to find the number of miles represented by $\$5$ worth of gasoline at the given rate. 
 - $\$5$ worth of gasoline at $\$4$ per gallon is $5/4 = 1.25$ gallons. 
 - This amount of gasoline, at a rate of $25$ miles per gallon, will allow him to drive $1.25 * 25 = 31.25$ miles. 
 - So, the equation representing this relationship is $\frac{25}{4}m = 31.25$, where $m$ is the number of fewer miles driven. 
 - Simplifying the equation, we get $\frac{25}{4}m = \frac{5}{4} * 12.5 = 5$, which is choice $D$.
