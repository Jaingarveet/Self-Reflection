Solution:

Given $p(3) = -2$, we know that when $x = 3$, the polynomial $p(x)$ equals $-2$. 

Now, we need to find the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. 

The remainder theorem states that when a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, the remainder is $p(c)$. 

In this case, $c = 3$, and we know that $p(3) = -2$. 

Therefore, the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$ is $-2$. 

So, the correct answer is: 

[REDACTED]: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2.
