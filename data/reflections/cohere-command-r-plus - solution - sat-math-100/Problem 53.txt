Solution:

The line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, and the slope is given as $\frac{1}{7}$. We can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: 
$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

Plugging in $m = \frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$, we get:
$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now, we can test each choice by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation:
- [REDACTED]: $(0, 7)$: $7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0$
- [REDACTED]: $(1, 7)$: $7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1$
- [REDACTED]: $(7, 7)$: $7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7$, which is true, but this does not mean that $(7, 7)$ lies on the line. We cannot choose an answer based on a single point satisfying the equation. We need to test the equation with the coordinates provided in the choices.
- [REDACTED]: $(14, 2)$: $2 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14$, which is true. This means that the point $(14, 2)$ satisfies the equation of the line and lies on the line.

Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
