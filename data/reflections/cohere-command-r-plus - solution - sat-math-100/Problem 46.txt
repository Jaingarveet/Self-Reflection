Solution:
The table provides lengths of 21 brown bullhead fish, including an outlier of 24 inches. 
The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. 
If we remove the outlier of 24 inches, the range will change the most. 
The maximum value will decrease from 24 to 16, resulting in a significant change in the range.
