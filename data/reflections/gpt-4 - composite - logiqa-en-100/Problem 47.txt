Explanation:
I misunderstood the logical structure of the statements. I focused on the part of the statement that said a company that needs financing cannot have dividends, and a company without dividends must need financing. However, I overlooked the fact that a company with dividends does not need financing, and a company that does not need financing can have dividends. This led me to choose the wrong answer.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical structure misunderstanding
- Conditional statement error
Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED] listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends." This is because the original statement implies that a company with dividends does not need financing. Therefore, if a listed company does not need financing, it could be a company with dividends. Conversely, if it is not a company with dividends, it could be because it needs financing.
Instructions:
1. Understand the logical structure of the original statement.
2. Identify the conditions and their implications.
3. Evaluate each choice based on the conditions and implications.
4. Choose the statement that cannot be false based on the original statement.
Advice:
- Always read the question and each choice carefully.
- Understand the logical structure of the statements.
- Identify the conditions and their implications.
- Evaluate each choice based on the conditions and implications.
- Be careful with conditional statements and their logical implications.
