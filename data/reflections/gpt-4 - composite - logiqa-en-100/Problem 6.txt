Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I correctly understood that the team cannot go to Lake J and must therefore go to Lake G. However, I failed to apply the second condition correctly, which states that if the team doesn't go to either City E or City F, they can't go to Lake G. Since they must go to Lake G, they must also visit either City E or City F. However, since they can't go to Mountain H without going to City E (according to condition 3), and they can't go to City E (since they can't go to Mountain H), they must go to City F. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of conditions
- Logic error
- Deductive reasoning error
Solution:
1. The team cannot go to I Peak, so they cannot reach Lake J (according to condition 4).
2. Therefore, they must visit Lake G to satisfy condition 1 (at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited).
3. If they visit Lake G, they must visit either City E or City F (according to condition 2).
4. They can't go to Mountain H without going to City E (according to condition 3), and since they can't go to Mountain H, they can't go to City E.
5. Therefore, they must go to City F.
6. So, the group went to City F and Lake G.
Instructions:
1. Understand each condition given in the problem.
2. Apply each condition to the given situation.
3. Use deductive reasoning to determine what must be true based on the conditions and the given situation.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your reasoned conclusion.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Use deductive reasoning to solve logic problems.
- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
- Remember that in logic problems, every detail can be important.
