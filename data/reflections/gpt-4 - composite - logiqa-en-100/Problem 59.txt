Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted condition 3. I thought that if X is in the sales department, then W must be in the production department. However, the condition actually states that if X is in the sales department, then W cannot be in the sales department but can be in any other department. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Conditional statement error
- Logic error
Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, keeping in mind the correct interpretation of condition 3.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: F, H, Y; Sales Department: G, I, X
This choice does not meet condition 3, which states that if X is in the sales department, then W cannot be in the sales department.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: G, I, X; Sales Department: F, H, Y
This choice does not meet condition 4, which states that F must be in the production department.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, Y, W
This choice does not meet condition 2, which states that F and G cannot be in the same department.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, I, W; Sales Department: G, H, Y
This choice meets all conditions. H and Y are in the same department, F and G are not in the same department, X is not in the sales department, and F is in the production department.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and all conditions carefully.
2. Understand the meaning of each condition.
3. Go through each choice and check if it meets all conditions.
4. Be careful with conditional statements. Understand that if condition [REDACTED] implies condition [REDACTED], it doesn't mean that if condition [REDACTED] is true, condition [REDACTED] must be true.
5. Choose the answer that meets all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the meaning of each condition.
- Be careful with conditional statements.
- Practice more problems to improve your logical thinking skills.
