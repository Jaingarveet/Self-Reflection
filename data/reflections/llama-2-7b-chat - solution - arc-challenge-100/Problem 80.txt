Solution:

1. Identify the source of heat in the scenario: the stove burner.
2. Identify the fluid involved in the transfer of heat: the soup.
3. Determine the direction of heat transfer: from the stove burner to the soup.
4. Explain how heat is transferred: through convection, as the circular motion of the spoon creates a current of hot soup that carries heat away from the spoon and to the surrounding air.
