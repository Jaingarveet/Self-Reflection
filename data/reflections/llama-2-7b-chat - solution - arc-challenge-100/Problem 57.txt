Solution:
The Ohio state tree is the buckeye, which reproduces through seeds. The buckeye tree produces seeds that contain the genetic information necessary for the tree to grow and reproduce. The color of the leaves in the autumn season is a result of the tree's genetic makeup, and is therefore inherited by the tree in the reproduction process.
