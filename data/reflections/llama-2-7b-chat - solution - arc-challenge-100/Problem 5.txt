Solution:

To find the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution, we need to use the fact that 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in [REDACTED]rams of water.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in [REDACTED]rams of water.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution: 10 grams / [REDACTED]rams = 0.1 grams (or [REDACTED]rams)

Therefore, the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution is [REDACTED]rams (C).
