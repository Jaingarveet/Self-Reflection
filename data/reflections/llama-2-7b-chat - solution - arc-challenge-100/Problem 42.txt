Solution:
When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force. The correct calculation is:

F = ma

Where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. Since the larger force is acting in the same direction as the acceleration, the object will accelerate in that direction.
