Solution:
To find the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.

The question states that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so the speed of the geese is:
speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day

Now, to find the distance traveled on the first day, we can multiply the speed by the number of days the geese have been traveling:
distance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
