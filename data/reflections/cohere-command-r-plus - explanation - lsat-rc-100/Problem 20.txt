Explanation:
I misinterpreted the author's attitude toward the two-fold obligation of defense lawyers. 
I focused too narrowly on the idea of "balancing responsibilities" without fully considering the nature of the obligations and the potential for conflict. 
The correct answer emphasizes that the two-fold obligation does not create a conflict of interest, which is a more abstract and nuanced point.
