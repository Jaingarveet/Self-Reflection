Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], "Test the antibiotic on human volunteers," as the way to strengthen the researchers' conclusions. However, testing on human volunteers is not a way to strengthen the conclusions drawn from limited testing. Instead, the researchers should ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic. This would provide an additional level of verification and validation of the initial findings.
