Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the sheep with light wool would have an advantage over the sheep with dark wool when a new predator is introduced. However, the question states that the sheep with dark wool are larger and stronger, which usually helps animals survive and breed. Therefore, the sheep with dark wool are more likely to survive the introduction of a new predator. The increase in the population of sheep with light wool in the last 20 years may be due to other factors, such as changes in the environment or breeding patterns.
