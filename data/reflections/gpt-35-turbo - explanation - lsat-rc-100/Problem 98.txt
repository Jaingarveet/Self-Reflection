Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that the author would be likely to disagree with the statement that the rate of criminals returning to criminal activity is likely to fall if laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders are adopted. However, the passage does not discuss the rate of recidivism, so it is not possible to determine the author's position on this statement. The author does suggest that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, which is the correct answer.
