Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was [REDACTED]. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the author views the strategy as [REDACTED]. Instead, the passage describes the strategy as "meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated" and "an innovation that forever changed the landscape of public interest law." These descriptions suggest that the author views the strategy as [REDACTED].
