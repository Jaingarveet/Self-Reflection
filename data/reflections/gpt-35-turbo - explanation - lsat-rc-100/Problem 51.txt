Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between the two sentences. 
The sentences at lines 28-31 express the author's opinion that defense lawyers should not take cases where they know their clients are guilty, while the sentence at lines 7-11 reports the opinion of other legal scholars that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
