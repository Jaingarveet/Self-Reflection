Explanation:
I misread the question and did not pay close attention to the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph. 
The third paragraph discusses the objection to the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures but still uses Western scientific methods to study cultures.
The objection argues that using Western scientific methods to study non-scientific cultures is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
