Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is not a point of disagreement between the two passages. Passage [REDACTED] acknowledges that fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, but argues that it has been used for 100 years and has long been considered reliable. Passage [REDACTED], on the other hand, argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
