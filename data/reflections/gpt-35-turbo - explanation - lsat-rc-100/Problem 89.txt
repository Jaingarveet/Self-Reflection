Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because I did not pay close attention to the details in the passage. The passage discusses how Thurgood Marshall's innovations in litigation strategy have been widely adopted and used for various public purposes, including by politically conservative public interest lawyers. The passage does not state that the first public interest law firms were established in response to Marshall's successes in NAACP litigations. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because the passage notes that Marshall's techniques have become the norm for U.S. public interest litigation today, and that they lend themselves to being used even for purposes that Marshall might not have intended.
