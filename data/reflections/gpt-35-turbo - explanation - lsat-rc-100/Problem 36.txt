Explanation:
I misinterpreted the objection discussed in the second paragraph. The objection argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and that trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. The objection does not argue that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
