Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is only supported by Passage [REDACTED]. Passage [REDACTED] argues that there are no objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. The passage suggests that fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable. This principle underlies the arguments in both passages.
