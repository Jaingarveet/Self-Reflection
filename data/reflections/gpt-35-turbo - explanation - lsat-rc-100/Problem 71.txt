Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because I misunderstood the argument made in Passage [REDACTED]. The author of Passage [REDACTED] is not arguing against the idea that behavior is orchestrated by genes, but rather against the idea that a particular interest (such as the proliferation of genes) can be inferred as the sole explanation for a particular behavior.
