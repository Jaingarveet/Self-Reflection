Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the given information only allowed for one possible arrangement of the islands. I failed to consider the possibility of different arrangements within the constraints provided.
Error Keywords:
- Oversimplification
- Lack of consideration of alternative possibilities
- Misinterpretation of constraints
Solution:
G is the northernmost island.
F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H.
I and E are adjacent.
Based on these constraints, there are four possible arrangements:
1. G-F-H-E-I
[REDACTED]. G-H-F-E-I
[REDACTED]. G-F-E-H-I
[REDACTED]. G-E-F-H-I
Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze all given information and identify the constraints they impose on the possible arrangements.
[REDACTED]. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints.
[REDACTED]. Do not jump to conclusions based on limited information.
[REDACTED]. Systematically explore all possibilities within the given constraints.
[REDACTED]. Double-check your analysis to ensure that you have not overlooked any valid arrangements.
Advice:
- When solving logic problems, pay close attention to the details and implications of each piece of information provided.
- Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints, even if they seem unlikely at first glance.
- Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
- Use a systematic approach to explore all possibilities and eliminate those that violate the given constraints.
- Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure that you have not made any errors in your logic.
