Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views.
My error was in misinterpreting the meaning of "refute." I focused on the specific claim about the unusual nature of the flickering light, rather than the broader argument about the lack of evidence.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Scope of argument
- Focus on specific claims
Solution:
Xiao Chen argues that the flickering light of Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before.
Xiao Wang counters that comets far away from the sun are not normally observed, and the flickering light was discovered through careful tracking observation.
Xiao Wang is directly refuting Xiao Chen's claim about the lack of evidence. By pointing out that the flickering light was only observed through careful tracking, Xiao Wang is suggesting that the lack of previous observations is not a valid reason to conclude that the flickering light is unusual.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the arguments presented by both Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang.
2. Identify the specific claim that Xiao Wang is refuting.
3. Analyze Xiao Wang's argument to determine the method used to refute Xiao Chen's claim.
4. Consider the broader context of the argument and the overall purpose of Xiao Wang's response.
5. Choose the answer that accurately reflects the method used by Xiao Wang to refute Xiao Chen's views.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the language used in the arguments, including key terms and phrases.
- Consider the logical structure of the arguments and how the claims are connected.
- Think critically about the assumptions and implications of each argument.
- Avoid focusing on specific details or claims without considering the broader context.
- Choose the answer that best reflects the overall method used to refute the opposing argument.
