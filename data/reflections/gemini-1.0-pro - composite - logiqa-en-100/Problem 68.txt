Explanation:
The argument relies on the assumption that a person can know exactly how long he can live before deciding whether to steal. 
This assumption is not stated explicitly in the argument, but it is necessary for the argument to be valid. 
Without this assumption, the argument would be flawed because it would be possible for someone to steal something from someone else even if they knew they would live for a long time.
Error Keywords:
 - Unstated assumption
 - Flawed reasoning
 - Necessary assumption
Solution:
The argument states that whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life. 
The argument then concludes that if a person only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people's things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught. 
However, this conclusion is only valid if the person can know exactly how long he can live. 
If the person cannot know how long he can live, then he may choose to do good behavior even if he knows he will only live for a few days.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the premises of the argument.
3. Determine whether the premises support the conclusion.
4. If the premises do not support the conclusion, identify the unstated assumption that is necessary for the argument to be valid.
5. Evaluate the validity of the argument based on the unstated assumption.
Advice:
 - Always be on the lookout for unstated assumptions.
 - Unstated assumptions can often be the most important part of an argument.
 - If you can identify the unstated assumptions of an argument, you will be in a better position to evaluate its validity.
 - Be aware of the different types of logical fallacies.
 - [REDACTED] logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes an argument invalid.
 - By being aware of the different types of logical fallacies, you will be better able to identify them and avoid making them yourself.
