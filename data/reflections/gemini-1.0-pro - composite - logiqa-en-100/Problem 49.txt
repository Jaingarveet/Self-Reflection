Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted the meaning of the words "Doximayo" and "Makasey" in the first sentence. 
I assumed that "Doximayo" meant "hostage" and "Makasey" meant "student" based on their positions in the sentence. 
However, the correct interpretation is that [REDACTED] and "Makasey" means "hostage." 
This misinterpretation led me to choose the incorrect answer.

Solution:
1. "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage"
2. "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) "Reporter",
3. "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away".
From 1 and 3, we know that "Alingoits" means "kidnapping" and "Mugbudengs" means "reporters".
From 2, we know that "Makasey" means "hostage".
From 1, we know that [REDACTED].
Therefore, statement [REDACTED] is true.
