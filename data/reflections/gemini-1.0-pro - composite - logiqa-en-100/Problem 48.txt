Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the best argument against the claim that the increase in Chinese buyers of US real estate is evidence of a growing number of wealthy Chinese people transferring their property abroad. 
I focused on the increase in turnover rather than the increase in the number of buyers.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the argument
 - Focus on irrelevant information
 - Failure to identify the best counterargument
Solution:
The argument is that the increase in Chinese buyers of US real estate is evidence of a growing number of wealthy Chinese people transferring their property abroad.
The best argument against this is that the increase in turnover could be due to other factors, such as an increase in the price of US real estate or an increase in the number of wealthy Chinese people buying US real estate as an investment.
