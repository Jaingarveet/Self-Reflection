Explanation:
My initial analysis was correct in identifying the relevant rules and their implications. However, I failed to consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions. 
Specifically, I overlooked the possibility that the team could have visited both E city and F city, which would allow them to visit G lake without violating rule (2).
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooking possibilities
 - Scenario omission
Solution:
1. The team did not go to I Peak.
2. According to rule (4), if the team did not go to I Peak, they could not go to Lake J.
3. According to rule (1), the team must visit at least one of Lake G and Lake J. Since they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit Lake G.
4. According to rule (2), if the team did not go to E city or F city, they could not go to G lake. Since they visited G lake, they must have gone to either E city or F city.
5. The team could have visited both E city and F city, satisfying rule (2) and allowing them to visit G lake.
6. Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that the team went to F city and G lake.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all given rules and conditions.
2. Identify all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
3. Analyze each scenario systematically to determine if it violates any rules.
4. Eliminate scenarios that violate any rules.
5. Identify the statements that are true for all remaining scenarios.
6. Choose the answer that reflects the statements that are true for all remaining scenarios.
Advice:
 - Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions, even if they seem unlikely.
 - Be systematic in your analysis and do not jump to conclusions.
 - Double-check your reasoning and ensure that it is consistent with all given rules and conditions.
 - Remember that the goal is to identify the statements that are true for all possible scenarios, not just the most likely scenario.
