Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

The reasoning is as follows:

Each type of book can be represented by a single letter or a pair of letters. Since there are [REDACTED] types of books, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all [REDACTED] types of books is [REDACTED].

I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer. Thank you for pointing it out.
