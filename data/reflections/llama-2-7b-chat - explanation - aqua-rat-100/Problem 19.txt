Explanation:
Great, let's break down the solution step by step:

1. The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, so the distance traveled can be calculated as:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 km/h x 6 hours = 360 km

So, the distance traveled by the jeep in the forward journey is 360 km.
2. During the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/h, so the time taken to travel the same distance can be calculated as:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 360 km / 72 km/h = 5 hours

So, the time taken by the jeep to travel the same distance during the return journey is 5 hours.
3. Now, we need to find the distance traveled by the jeep during the return journey. Since the jeep traveled a certain distance in the forward journey, we can add it to the distance traveled during the return journey to get the total distance:

Total Distance = Forward Distance + Return Distance
Total Distance = 360 km + 360 km = 720 km

So, the distance traveled by the jeep in total is 720 km.

Now, let's compare our answer with the options given in the question:

Option [REDACTED]: 720 km

So, the correct answer is Option [REDACTED]: 720 km.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
