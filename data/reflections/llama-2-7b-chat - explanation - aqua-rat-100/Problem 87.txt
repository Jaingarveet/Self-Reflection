Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong combinatorial principle. I thought the problem was asking for the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, which is a classic problem in combinatorics. However, the correct approach is to use the principle of permutations, as we are counting the number of ways to arrange 2 oranges from the basket.
