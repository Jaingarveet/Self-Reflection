Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem and applied the wrong reasoning. I thought the problem was asking for the number of men required to complete the work in half a day, so I calculated the answer based on that assumption. However, the problem is actually asking for the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day, which is different.
