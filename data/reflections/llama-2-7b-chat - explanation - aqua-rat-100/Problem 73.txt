Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning, which led me to choose the incorrect answer. Here's why:

We are given that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 20% of 501, which is 100.5 students. However, this means that the number of students who did not take physics is 501 - 100.5 = 400.5 students.

We are also given that 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 28% of 501, which is 140.5 students. However, this means that the number of students who did not take math is 501 - 140.5 = 360.5 students.

Since we cannot have more than 501 students in the school, the least possible number of students in the school is 501 - 400.5 - 360.5 = 359.5 students. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) None of these.

Keywords that describe the type of errors in this problem:

1. Miscalculation: I made a mistake in my calculations, especially when I was calculating the number of students who took physics and math.
2. Logical fallacy: I made an incorrect assumption that the number of students who took physics was equal to the number of students who did not take physics.
3. Overlooking a constraint: I forgot that the total number of students in the school cannot be more than 501, which led me to choose an answer that was greater than 501.

To avoid making similar mistakes in the future, I will:

1. Double-check my calculations and ensure that they are correct.
2. Break down complex problems into simpler subproblems and work through each step carefully.
3. Ensure that I understand the constraints of the problem and do not overlook any important details.
