Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the question and applied the wrong formula to solve the problem.

The correct formula to solve this problem is:
Number of toys prepared by Jacob = Number of toys prepared by Alex / Time it takes Alex to make a toy

Using the given information:
Number of toys prepared by Alex = 35
Time it takes Alex to make a toy = 7 hours

So, Number of toys prepared by Jacob = 35 / 7 = 5

The correct answer is (B) 5 toys.
