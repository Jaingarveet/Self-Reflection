Explanation:
Great job on breaking down the problem step by step! However, there is a small mistake in your calculation.

You calculated the bus fare as follows:

Bus fare = Total fare / Number of persons
= 1512 / 6
= 252

But, you forgot to take into account the fact that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. So, the correct calculation for the bus fare is:

Bus fare = (4/3) × Train fare
= (4/3) × 189
= 252

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].

Here's a summary of the steps you can follow to solve this problem:

1. Analyze the problem step by step.
2. Identify the given information and the question being asked.
3. Use the given information to calculate the train fare for one person.
4. Use the train fare to calculate the bus fare for one person.
5. Check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

Remember, always double-check your work and use the correct mathematical concepts to solve problems. Good luck!
