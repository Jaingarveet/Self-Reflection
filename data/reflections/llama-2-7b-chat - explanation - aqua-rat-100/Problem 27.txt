Explanation:
I understand the concept of sharing a cost among a group of people, but I made a calculation error in my answer.

The correct solution is:

If 3 men drop out, the remaining M-3 men will have to contribute D/M-3 towards the purchase of the gift.

The reasoning is:

Total amount of money = D
Number of people = M

If 3 men drop out, the number of people = M-3

So, the share of each person = D/M-3

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].
