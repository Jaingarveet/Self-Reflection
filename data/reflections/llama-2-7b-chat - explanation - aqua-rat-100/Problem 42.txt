Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation and answered the question incorrectly. The correct answer is [REDACTED].

The correct calculation for the length of the fence is:

Length of fence = Number of pickets x Width of each picket / 2
= 13x / 2

So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: (13x - 12) / 24.
