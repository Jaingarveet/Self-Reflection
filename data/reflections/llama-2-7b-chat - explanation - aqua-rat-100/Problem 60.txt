Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the question and overlooked an important detail.

The correct solution is:

If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED].

In this case, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150째. Therefore, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is:

A[REDACTED] = A[REDACTED] - B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] - 150째 = 10째

So, the correct answer is (B) 10째.
