Explanation:
I miscounted the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 points of a regular pentagon. I thought there were only [REDACTED] quadrilaterals possible, but there are actually 1[REDACTED].

The error in my thinking was that I limited the number of quadrilaterals to [REDACTED], when in fact there are many more possibilities. I should have considered all the possible combinations of 2 points from each side of the pentagon to form a quadrilateral.
