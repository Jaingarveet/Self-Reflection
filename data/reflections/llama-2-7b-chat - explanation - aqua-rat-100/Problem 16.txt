Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the conversion ratio between the map distance and the actual distance.

The correct conversion ratio is 1/4 inch on the map = 10 miles, not 1/4 inch on the map = 1 mile.

So, if the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches on the map, the actual distance can be found by multiplying the map distance by 10, not by 1.

The correct answer is (20 x 10) = 200 miles.
