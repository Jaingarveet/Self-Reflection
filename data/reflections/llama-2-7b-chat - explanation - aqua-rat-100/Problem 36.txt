Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly calculated the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

The correct calculation is:

90% of 100% - [REDACTED] of 100% = 90% - [REDACTED] = 80%

So, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 80%.
