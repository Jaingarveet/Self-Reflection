Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my previous answer. I misinterpreted the problem and calculated Rahim's age incorrectly.

The correct solution is as follows:

Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back, which means Rahim's age was 3x = 15 years ago.
Now, Raj is 17 years old, so Rahim's current age is 17 + 5 = 22 years old.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED] years old.
