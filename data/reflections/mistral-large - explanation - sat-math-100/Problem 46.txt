Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the impact of removing the outlier on the range.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the definitions of mean, median, and range, but in understanding how removing an outlier affects each of these measures.
I knew the correct definitions of mean, median, and range, but made an error in my analysis of how removing the outlier would affect each measure.
