Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions regarding when Nina can give a report. I assumed that Nina could not report on Monday because George is the only one who can report on Tuesday. However, the condition is that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina can report on Monday, and Helen and Irving can report on Tuesday.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Condition misunderstanding
- Logical error
Solution:
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only report on Tuesday, this means that Nina and Robert must report on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to report the next day (unless Nina reports on Wednesday), Nina can report on Monday, and Helen and Irving can report on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
