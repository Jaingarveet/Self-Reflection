Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the sales department could not be one level above the administrative department because it would be adjacent to the human resources department. However, the condition only states that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent, not that they cannot be on consecutive floors.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the conditions:
1) The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3) The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
4) The human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department.
From these conditions, we can infer that:
- The human resources department is not on the top floor.
- The sales department can be one level above the administrative department because it would not be adjacent to the human resources department.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
