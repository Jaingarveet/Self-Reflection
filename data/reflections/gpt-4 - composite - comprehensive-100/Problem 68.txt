Explanation:
I made a mistake in setting up the equation for the slope. I incorrectly assumed that the slope of the line passing through the origin should be zero, which is not necessarily true. The slope of a line passing through the origin can be any real number, not just zero.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of concept
- Incorrect equation setup
- Slope calculation error
Solution:
[REDACTED] line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If this line passes through the origin, then the slope must be the same when x=[REDACTED]. So, we need to solve the equation (32-k)/(k-2) = k/2. Solving this equation gives k = [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand that a line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx.
2. Calculate the slope of the line determined by the given points.
3. Set up an equation equating the calculated slope to k/2, since the line passes through the origin.
[REDACTED]. Solve the equation to find the value of k.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Understand the concept of slope and how it relates to a line passing through the origin.
- Be careful when setting up equations. Make sure your equation accurately represents the problem.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
