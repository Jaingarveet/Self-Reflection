Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information given in the passage. I focused on the variability of allergic reactions among individuals, rather than the variability of proteins among cats.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension error
- Focus error
Solution:
The passage states that people who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva. The specific proteins responsible for the allergic reactions vary among individuals. This implies that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
