Solution:
The passage starts with Ken Dial observing young birds' behavior and designing an experiment to study it. However, an unexpected finding (the birds using their legs instead of flying) arises during the early phase of the study. This leads to a modification of the study (adding hay bales for the birds to perch on). The results of the modified study are then interpreted and evaluated, leading to the proposal of a new hypothesis about bird flight. This sequence of events aligns with choice [REDACTED].
