Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the principle that the person is relying on.
* Consider all of the available choices and choose the one that most accurately reflects the principle.
* Consider broader principles that may apply to the situation, rather than limiting yourself to a narrow interpretation of the facts.
* Double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately reflects the principle that the person is relying on.
* Remember that the principle of treating people in a way that is similar to how they have treated others is a broader principle that applies to all cases where people have treated others in a certain way.
