Instructions:
1. Carefully read the original argument and identify its reasoning structure.
2. For each answer choice, map out the reasoning structure of that argument.
3. Compare each answer choice's reasoning structure to the original argument's structure.
4. Identify which answer choice argument has the reasoning structure that most closely matches the original argument.
5. Don't get distracted by superficial similarities; focus on the core logic and structure of the arguments.
6. Double check that the argument you chose as most analogous really does mirror the original argument's reasoning.
