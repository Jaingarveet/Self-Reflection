Instructions:
1. Identify the key action or decision being made.
2. Identify the reasoning or justification given for that action/decision. 
3. Determine if the reasoning relies on a specific example or a general principle.
4. If the reasoning uses a specific example, ask if there is a broader principle that could justify it.
5. Look for an answer choice that matches the general principle, not just the specific example.
6. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the key principle being applied.
7. Select the answer that best captures the broadest relevant principle justifying the reasoning.
