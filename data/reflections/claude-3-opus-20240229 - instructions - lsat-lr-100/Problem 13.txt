Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the premises and conclusion.
2. Look for the gap between the premises and the conclusion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one, if assumed, would bridge the gap and enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
4. Choose the answer that provides the necessary assumption without being too specific or irrelevant to the argument.
5. Double-check that the chosen answer, when combined with the premises, logically leads to the conclusion.
