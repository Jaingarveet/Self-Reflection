Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific assertion or statement it is asking about.
2. Break down the argument into its main points and the roles that each statement plays.
3. Identify how the assertion in question relates to the overall argument - is it a main claim, a supporting reason, a counterargument, an objection, or something else?
4. Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately describe the role of the assertion.
5. Select the answer choice that most precisely captures how the assertion functions in the context of the larger argument.
