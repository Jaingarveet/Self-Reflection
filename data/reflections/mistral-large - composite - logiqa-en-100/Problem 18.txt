Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not follow the correct format for providing my answer.

Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect format
 - Answer format error
 - Missing "Action: Answer" statement

Solution:
The statement in the stem describes a situation where the celebrity is in a dilemma regarding whether to clarify and refute the gossip news or not. If she does not clarify, the rumors will be believed by the public, and if she does clarify, it will attract more attention and spread the gossip news faster and wider. Therefore, the celebrity cannot actually stop the gossip news from damaging her personal reputation.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the statement in the stem and analyze its implications.
3. Evaluate each answer choice and determine which one must be true based on the statement in the stem.
4. Format your answer correctly by stating "Action: Answer([ANSWER\_CHOICE])", where [ANSWER\_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always follow the correct format for providing your answer.
* Always evaluate each answer choice carefully and determine which one must be true based on the statement in the stem.
* Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the correct answer choice must be true based on the statement in the stem, not just possibly true.
