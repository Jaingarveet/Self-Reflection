Explanation:
I made an error in my interpretation of the conditions.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the conditions and applying them correctly.
I misinterpreted condition (3) to mean that K and J must always be in the same group, but it only states that if K is in a group, then J must also be in that group.
I also overlooked condition (5) which states that at least one employee must be in both groups.

Error Keywords:
 - Interpretation error
 - Condition application error
 - Overlooking conditions

Solution:
The members of the printing group are [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M.
The members of the binding group are [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and J.
If K replaces [REDACTED], then [REDACTED] and K would be in the same group, violating condition (2).
If K replaces [REDACTED], then K would not be in the same group as J, but J is not in the printing group, so condition (3) is not violated. Also, M is still in one of the groups, and [REDACTED] is in both groups, so conditions (4) and (5) are satisfied.
If K replaces [REDACTED], then K would be in the same group as J, but [REDACTED] is the only employee in both groups, so condition (5) would be violated.
If K replaces [REDACTED], then K would not be in the same group as J, violating condition (3).

Instructions:
1. Read the conditions carefully and understand their implications.
2. Identify the members of each group.
3. Consider each replacement option and evaluate whether it violates any conditions.
4. Check each condition thoroughly and ensure that it is satisfied.
5. Double-check your reasoning and ensure that all conditions are met.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.

Advice:
 - Always read the question and conditions carefully and understand their implications.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and ensure that all conditions are met.
 - Remember to consider all conditions, not just some of them.
 - Be aware of the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.
