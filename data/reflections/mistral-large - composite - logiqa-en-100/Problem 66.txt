Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not consider all possible arrangements based on the given information.

Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Missing arrangements
 - Logic error

Solution:
From the given information, we know that F is north of H, I and E are adjacent, and G is north of F and is the northernmost island.
We can represent the possible arrangements as follows:

1. G - F - H - I - E
[REDACTED]. G - F - H - E - I
[REDACTED]. G - F - I - E - H
[REDACTED]. G - I - F - H - E

Instructions:
1. Identify the given information about the arrangement of the islands.
[REDACTED]. Draw a diagram or use symbols to represent the possible arrangements based on the given information.
[REDACTED]. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.
[REDACTED]. Count the number of unique arrangements.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches the number of unique arrangements.
