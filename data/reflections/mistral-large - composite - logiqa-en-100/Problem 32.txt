Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not fully understand the meaning of the word "derive" in this context. I thought it meant to directly infer from the given statement, but it actually means to logically deduce from the given statement.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the word "derive"
* Incorrect interpretation of the question
* Lack of logical deduction

Solution:
The statement "[REDACTED]" cannot be derived from the context because it is not mentioned that being careful means having no taste.
The statement "[REDACTED]" cannot be derived from the context because it is not mentioned that being overbearing means being immoral.
The statement "[REDACTED]" can be derived from the context because it is mentioned that if humans plunder nature, there will be no sustainable life.
The statement "[REDACTED]" cannot be derived from the context because it is not mentioned that being immoral means being overbearing and careful. However, it can be logically deduced that if a person is immoral, he may be overbearing and not careful, but it is not necessarily true that he is both.
