Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the trade-off between economic development and social stability, but I did not consider the overall impact of the situation on the country.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in understanding the broader implications of the statement.
I knew the correct relationship between the variables but failed to consider the overall impact on the country.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Lack of consideration of broader implications
 - Overemphasis on specific details
Solution:
The statement suggests that there is a trade-off between maintaining economic development and social stability.
To maintain economic development, the competitiveness of domestic enterprises must be strengthened, but paying social insurance premiums for employees reduces the competitiveness of enterprises.
Therefore, the country cannot maintain both economic development and social stability simultaneously.

1. Identify the variables in the statement and their relationships.
2. Consider the broader implications of the statement on the country.
3. Evaluate the overall impact of the situation on the country.
4. Choose the answer that reflects the overall impact of the situation on the country.

 - Always consider the broader implications of the statement.
 - Always evaluate the overall impact of the situation on the country.
 - Never focus solely on specific details without considering the overall impact.
