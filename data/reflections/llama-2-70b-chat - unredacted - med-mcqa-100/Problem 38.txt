  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the radiological feature of the cobra snake head appearance. I thought it was associated with posterior urethral valve, but it is actually a characteristic feature of ureterocele.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding
* Radiological feature confusion
* Posterior urethral valve
* Ureterocele

Solution:
Cobra snake head appearance is seen in ureterocele.

Instructions:

1. Review the radiological features of ureterocele and posterior urethral valve.
2. Understand the difference between the two conditions and their characteristic radiological appearances.
3. Remember that cobra snake head appearance is a feature of ureterocele, not posterior urethral valve.
4. In similar questions, carefully read the options and associate the radiological feature with the correct condition.

Advice:

* Always review and update your knowledge of radiological features and their associated conditions.
* Be careful when associating radiological features with conditions, and double-check your answers.
* Use radiological images and illustrations to aid in your understanding and memory of characteristic features.
* Practice identifying radiological features and their associated conditions to improve your accuracy.
