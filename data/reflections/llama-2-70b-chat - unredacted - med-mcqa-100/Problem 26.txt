  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the joints in the neck. I knew that flexion and extension in the neck occur at the Atlanto-axial joint, but I mistakenly identified the wrong joint.

Error Keywords:

* Joint confusion
* Anatomy mistake
* Neck joints

Solution:
Flexion and extension in the neck occur at the Atlanto-occipital joint. This joint is between the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone. It allows for the nodding movement of the head.

Instructions:

1. Identify the joint that allows for the nodding movement of the head.
2. Recall the location of the atlas (C1) and the occipital bone.
3. Associate the Atlanto-occipital joint with the correct movement.

Advice:

* Review the anatomy of the neck joints to avoid confusion.
* Pay close attention to the specific movement associated with each joint.
* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or illustrations, to help reinforce your understanding.
* Practice identifying the different joints and their associated movements to build confidence.
