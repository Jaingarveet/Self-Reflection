  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between keratoderma blenorrhagica and psoriasis.
I knew that keratoderma blenorrhagica is a condition that affects people with psoriasis, but I mistakenly thought it was a symptom of psoriatic arthritis, rather than reactive arthritis.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Confusion
- Incorrect association
Solution:
Keratoderma blenorrhagica is a condition characterized by the development of keratoses (thickened skin) and blenorrhea (a discharge).
It is often associated with psoriasis, which is a chronic skin condition that causes red, itchy, and scaly patches on the skin.
Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in response to an infection, and it is often associated with psoriasis.
Instructions:
1. Review the relationship between keratoderma blenorrhagica and psoriasis.
2. Understand that keratoderma blenorrhagica is a symptom of reactive arthritis, not psoriatic arthritis.
3. Recognize that reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in response to an infection.
4. Associate reactive arthritis with psoriasis, as it is a common comorbidity.
5. Choose the correct answer, "C: Reactive arthritis."
Advice:
- Review the relationships between different conditions and their symptoms.
- Understand the differences between similar conditions, such as psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthritis.
- Be careful when associating symptoms with conditions, ensuring that the association is correct.
- Double-check your answers, ensuring that they are consistent with the information provided in the question.
