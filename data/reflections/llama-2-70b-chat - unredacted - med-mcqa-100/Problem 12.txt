  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the exception to the rule. Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids except proline, which is synthesized from glutamine. However, hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine and does not require aminoacyl t-RNA.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding
* Exception to the rule
* Confusion between similar concepts

Solution:
Aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids except proline and hydroxylysine. Hydroxylysine is synthesized from glutamine, just like proline.

Instructions:

1. Review the exceptions to the rule that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids.
2. Understand the difference between proline and hydroxylysine synthesis.
3. Recall that hydroxylysine is also synthesized from glutamine.
4. Choose the correct answer, C, Hydroxylysine.

Advice:

* Always review and understand the exceptions to a rule.
* Be aware of similarities and differences between related concepts.
* Double-check your answers, especially when there are similar options.
* Use mnemonic devices to remember exceptions to rules.
* Practice, practice, practice to build your knowledge and confidence.
