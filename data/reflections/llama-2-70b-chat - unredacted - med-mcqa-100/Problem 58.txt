  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the term "suggilation" with "algor mortis," which is the cooling of the body after death. I knew that sugilation had something to do with the appearance of blood in the skin, but I didn't know the correct term.

Error Keywords:

* Confusion
* Misinformation
* Terminology error

Solution:
Suggilation refers to the postmortem staining of the skin due to the settling of blood in the lower parts of the body. This occurs due to gravity and can be used to determine the position of the body at the time of death.

Instructions:

1. Review the terminology used in forensic medicine.
2. Understand the difference between sugilation, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and postmortem caloricity.
3. Remember that sugilation refers to the postmortem staining of the skin due to the settling of blood in the lower parts of the body.
4. Associate sugilation with the correct term, "postmortem staining."
