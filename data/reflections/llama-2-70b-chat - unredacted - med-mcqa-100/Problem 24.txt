  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the safety profile of propylthiouracil during pregnancy.
I was aware that propylthiouracil can cause congenital malformations, but I thought it was still safe to use during pregnancy.
Error Keywords:
- Safety profile
- Pregnancy
- Congenital malformations
Solution:
Propylthiouracil is not safe to use during pregnancy due to the risk of congenital malformations.
The preferred antithyroid drug during pregnancy is methimazole, as it has a lower risk of adverse effects compared to carbimazole.
Instructions:
1. Identify the antithyroid drug that is safe to use during pregnancy.
2. Research the safety profile of each antithyroid drug.
3. Choose the drug with the lowest risk of adverse effects during pregnancy.
Advice:
- Always research the safety profile of medications, especially during pregnancy.
- Never assume that a medication is safe during pregnancy without proper research.
- Always prioritize the safety of the patient, especially during pregnancy.
- Keep up-to-date with the latest research and guidelines regarding medication use during pregnancy.
