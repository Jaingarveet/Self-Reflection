Instructions:
1. Identify the base number and the exponent.
2. If the exponent is a fraction, rewrite the expression according to the properties of exponents: $(a^{\frac{m}{n}}) = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\frac{1}{n}})^m$.
3. Simplify the inner expression first, i.e., $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
4. Then, raise the simplified inner expression to the power of the numerator of the original exponent.
5. Simplify the resulting expression if possible.
6. Choose the answer that matches your simplified expression.
