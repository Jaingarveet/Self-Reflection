Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the second batch of peanut butter cookies could be made on Wednesday. However, this is not possible given the constraints. Since the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and no two batches of the same kind can be made on the same day, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made later in the week, either Thursday or Friday. Therefore, it is not possible for two different kinds of cookies to have their second batch made on Wednesday.
