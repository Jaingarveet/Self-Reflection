Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the constraints on the Himalayan kittens. I correctly identified that Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days, but I incorrectly assumed that they could not be featured on consecutive days. The problem states that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, but this applies to all breeds collectively, not to each individual breed. My misinterpretation of this rule led me to eliminate correct answer [REDACTED] and incorrectly choose [REDACTED].
