Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice [REDACTED] was possible and choice [REDACTED] was impossible. I failed to properly apply the constraint that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. With choice [REDACTED], selecting both French plays would preclude selecting the one play mentioned.
