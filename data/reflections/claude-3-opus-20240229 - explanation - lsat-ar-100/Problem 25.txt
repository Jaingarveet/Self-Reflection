Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that if G is fourth, then H must be fifth. However, I failed to consider all possible orderings that satisfy the given conditions while placing G in the fourth position. My reasoning was too narrow and I eliminated valid possibilities prematurely.
