Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if both G and H were selected, the panel could include either F or M as the chemist. However, I overlooked the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must also be selected. This would violate the rule that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, if both G and H are selected, the chemist must be either F or K, not M.
