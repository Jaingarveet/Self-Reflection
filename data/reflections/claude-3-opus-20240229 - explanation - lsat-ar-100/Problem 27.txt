Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the number of students who could review the same play(s). I incorrectly assumed that if Megregian reviewed Tamerlane, it would violate the condition that exactly two students review the same play(s). However, the condition states that exactly two students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, which allows for more than two students to review a single play as long as only two of them review an identical set of plays.
