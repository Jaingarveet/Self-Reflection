Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the order of the reports. I incorrectly assumed that if Nina reported on Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must report on Tuesday. However, the condition states that if Nina reports, then Helen and Irving must report the next day, not necessarily on Tuesday. This led me to incorrectly conclude that Helen must report on Monday morning.
