Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning when checking the conditions against the answer choices. Specifically, I misinterpreted the condition about the second batch of oatmeal cookies being made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. I thought this meant they had to be made on the same day, but the condition actually states that this is true in the correct answer. My reasoning was flawed.
