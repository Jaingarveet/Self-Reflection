I focused too much on trying to construct a specific scenario that satisfied all the constraints, rather than analyzing what must be true in all possible valid scenarios. By doing so, I overlooked that regardless of the specific works chosen, the organizer must always select at least [REDACTED] to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
