Explanation:
I made an error in my logical deduction. I incorrectly assumed that if exactly three students review Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill only review Tamerlane, then Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian must be the three reviewing Undulation. However, this contradicts the condition that neither Lopez nor Megregian can review a play that Jiang reviews. My reasoning was flawed and I failed to consider all the given conditions.
