Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the positions of the businesses. I correctly identified that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist, and that the optometrist is next to the shoe store. However, I then incorrectly assumed that the second restaurant must be in the 6th position, which led me to incorrectly place the veterinarian and toy store.
