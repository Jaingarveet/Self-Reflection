Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the constraints on [REDACTED]'s and [REDACTED]'s sessions. I incorrectly assumed that if [REDACTED] led a Wednesday session, [REDACTED] must lead the Wednesday morning session. However, the question only states that [REDACTED]'s session must be earlier in the week than [REDACTED]'s, not necessarily on the same day. This incorrect assumption led me to the wrong answer.
