Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the distribution of books on the shelves. I incorrectly assumed that since there were 7 books left to distribute between the top and bottom shelves, the only way to have more books on the bottom than the top was a 4-3 split. However, a 5-2 split also satisfies the condition. This incorrect assumption led me to eliminate correct answer [REDACTED] and choose incorrect answer [REDACTED].
