Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible positions for S. I correctly identified that T and F are in the 5th and 6th positions, O is in the 1st position, and either L or H is in the 8th position. However, I did not properly consider the implications of the condition "P is performed at some time before S" in conjunction with the other constraints.
