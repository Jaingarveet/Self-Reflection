Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer [REDACTED] because I thought the contrapositive of the original statement would have the same logical effect. However, the original statement does not preclude the possibility of Kayne being assigned without Jaramillo. The correct answer, [REDACTED], captures the full meaning of the original constraint by preventing Jaramillo from being assigned unless Kayne is also assigned.
