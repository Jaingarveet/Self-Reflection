Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that S could be in the [REDACTED] position. I failed to fully consider all the constraints and their implications. Specifically, I overlooked that if S is [REDACTED], it would have to be immediately followed by Q and R (since they cover the same topic and must be consecutive). However, this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
