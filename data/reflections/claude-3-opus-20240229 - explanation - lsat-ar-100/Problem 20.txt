Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the order of the morning reports. I correctly identified that George must give his report on Tuesday morning, and that Olivia and Robert must give morning reports if they present. However, I failed to properly consider the condition about Nina's report and its impact on Helen and Irving's reports.
