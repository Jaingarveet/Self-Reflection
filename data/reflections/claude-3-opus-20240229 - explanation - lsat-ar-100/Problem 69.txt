Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible compositions that could be performed fifth. I correctly identified that O must be performed first or fifth, and since P is third, O must be first. However, I then incorrectly concluded that O must be fifth, when in fact the question states that either [REDACTED] must be fifth if P is third and S is sixth.
