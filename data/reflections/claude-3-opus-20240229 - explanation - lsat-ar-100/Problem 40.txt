Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that a restaurant could not be in space 3. I failed to consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the given constraints. Specifically, I did not realize that with the shoe store in space 2, it's possible to have the pharmacy in space 1, a restaurant in space 7, and the other restaurant in space 3, with the other businesses arranged in the middle spaces according to the constraints.
