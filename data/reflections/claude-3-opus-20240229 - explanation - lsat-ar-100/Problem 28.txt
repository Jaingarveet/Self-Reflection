Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the fifth scientist. I incorrectly assumed that since we already had two zoologists, we could not select another botanist. [REDACTED]owever, the condition states that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, not the other way around. We have only one botanist, so we can still select another zoologist.
Error [REDACTED]eywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Conditional statement misinterpretation
 - Incorrect constraint application
