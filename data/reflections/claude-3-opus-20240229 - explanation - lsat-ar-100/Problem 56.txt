Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the distribution of representatives across the zones. I incorrectly assumed that for Zone 1 to have the most representatives, it must have at least 3. However, this is not necessarily true. Zone 1 could have just 2 representatives and still be the zone with the most if Zones 2 and 3 each have only 1 representative.
