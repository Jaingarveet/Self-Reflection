I incorrectly determined that Choice [REDACTED] fully specified the shelf placement for all books, when in fact Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer. My error was in not carefully considering all possible arrangements for each choice. I jumped to a conclusion with Choice [REDACTED] without fully analyzing the constraints.
