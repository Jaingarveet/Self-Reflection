Explanation:
I miscounted the number of employees whose parking space assignment is limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces. I correctly identified that Togowa is limited to spaces #1 or #2, but I failed to recognize that this also limits Young to spaces #2 or #3 (since Young must have a higher number than Togowa). Similarly, since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this limits Robertson to spaces #3 or #4. I didn't fully think through the implications of each rule on the other employees' possible assignments.
