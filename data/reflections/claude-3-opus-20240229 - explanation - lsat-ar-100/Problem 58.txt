Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible locations of [REDACTED]. I correctly determined that [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] must be in ascending order, but I failed to consider that [REDACTED] must be in bay 5 or 6 based on this ordering. Since there are only 6 bays total, if [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] take up two of the first four bays, then [REDACTED] cannot fit in the first four bays. My reasoning about the location of [REDACTED] was correct, but incomplete in terms of solving the overall problem.
