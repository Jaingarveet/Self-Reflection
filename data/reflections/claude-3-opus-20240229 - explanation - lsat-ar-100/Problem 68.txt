Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible positions of the articles. I incorrectly assumed that if J was third, then H could be sixth. However, I failed to consider all of the constraints on the ordering, particularly that G must be earlier than R. This means that if J is third, G must be fourth and R must be fifth, leaving only the sixth and seventh positions for H and Y.
