Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the fourth constraint. I thought that Julio's session had to be on an earlier day than Olivia's, but the constraint actually states that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. I interpreted "earlier" as meaning the immediately preceding day, but "earlier day of the week" allows for a gap of one or more days between their sessions.
