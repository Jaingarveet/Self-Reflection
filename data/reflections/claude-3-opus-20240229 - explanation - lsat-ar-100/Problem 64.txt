Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible zone assignments. I incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3 based on the number of representatives in each zone. However, the question stem does not provide enough information to determine their exact zone. My reasoning was too definitive given the available information.
