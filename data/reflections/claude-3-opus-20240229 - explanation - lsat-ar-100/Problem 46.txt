Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Theresa could test bicycle F on the second day if she tested bicycle H on the first day. However, I failed to consider that if Theresa tests H on the first day, then one of the other riders must test H on the second day to satisfy the condition that all bicycles are tested each day. This means Theresa cannot test F on the second day.
