Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that Choice [REDACTED] satisfied all the rules, when in fact it violates rule 3. I failed to properly apply the transitive property of the "higher-numbered than" relationship. Since Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Young, and Young must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa, it follows that Robertson must also be assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa. Choice [REDACTED] violates this by assigning Robertson space #2 and Togowa space #1.
