Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the relative positions of books O and M. I incorrectly assumed that there was not enough information to determine if O was on a higher shelf than M. However, the given conditions state that O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Since there are only 3 shelves, this means O must be on a higher shelf than M.
