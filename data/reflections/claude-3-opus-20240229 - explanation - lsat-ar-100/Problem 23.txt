Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that since Helen gives a report on Wednesday, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. However, the condition states that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. It doesn't preclude Nina from giving a report on Monday or Tuesday.
