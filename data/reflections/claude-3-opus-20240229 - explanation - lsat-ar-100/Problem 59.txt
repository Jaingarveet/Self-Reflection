Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that P cannot be performed [REDACTED], but the correct answer is that P cannot be performed [REDACTED]. I failed to properly consider all the constraints when O is performed fifth. Specifically, I did not account for the fact that at least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
