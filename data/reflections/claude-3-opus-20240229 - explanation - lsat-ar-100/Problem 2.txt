Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the constraint "the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses" meant that there must be at least three spaces between the restaurants. However, the phrase "at least two other businesses" actually means that there must be a minimum of two spaces between the restaurants, not three.
