Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I focused on the information given in the question and didn't consider all the constraints and their implications. I didn't realize that if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it would have to be on Friday, and thus exactly one batch would be made on Friday.
