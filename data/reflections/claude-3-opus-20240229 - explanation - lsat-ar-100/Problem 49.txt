I made an error in my reasoning about the constraints. Specifically, I incorrectly eliminated choice [REDACTED] by stating that the pharmacy was not next to the optometrist or veterinarian. However, in choice [REDACTED], the pharmacy is adjacent to the veterinarian. My reasoning about the other constraints and eliminations was correct, but this one crucial error led me to select the wrong answer.
