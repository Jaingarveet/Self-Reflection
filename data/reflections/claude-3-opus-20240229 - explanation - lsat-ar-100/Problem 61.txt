Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice [REDACTED] (Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia) cannot be true. While I correctly reasoned through most of the constraints, I made a mistake in my final analysis. I failed to consider that if Kayne is assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo could be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen, satisfying all the given constraints.
