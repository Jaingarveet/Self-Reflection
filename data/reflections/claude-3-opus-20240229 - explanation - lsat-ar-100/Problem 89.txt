Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the third batch of oatmeal cookies could not be made on Friday because it would violate the condition that no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day. However, I failed to consider that the first batch of sugar cookies being made on Monday is the only choice that could be true based on the given conditions.
