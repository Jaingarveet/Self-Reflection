Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the relationship between Image's website and voicemail targets. I correctly stated that [REDACTED] must be equal to or shorter than its website target, but I incorrectly concluded that it must be 1 day. In fact, since Image's website target is 2 days, its voicemail target must also be 2 days to satisfy the condition that no client's website target can be longer than its voicemail target.
