Explanation:
I incorrectly selected choice [REDACTED] as a possible true statement, failing to fully consider all the given conditions. Specifically, I overlooked that if none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, and Image's website target is 1 day (to be shorter than its voicemail target), then Solide's website target must be 3 days. This makes choice [REDACTED] impossible.
