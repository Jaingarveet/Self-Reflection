Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the location of the second restaurant. I correctly determined that the pharmacy must be in space 7 and one restaurant in space 1. However, I then incorrectly concluded that the second restaurant must be in space 6 to be separated by at least two businesses from the first restaurant. In fact, the second restaurant could be in space 4, which is also separated by at least two businesses (the optometrist and shoe store in some order in spaces 2 and 3) from the restaurant in space 1.
