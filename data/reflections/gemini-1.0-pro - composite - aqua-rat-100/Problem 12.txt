Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the equation and finding the value of x. 
My error was in the algebraic manipulation of the equation.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Equation solving error
 - Calculation error
Solution:
Let the number be x.
(x-30)/3 = x/2
2x-60 = 3x
x = 60
50% of 60 = 30
Instructions:
1. Assign a variable to the unknown number.
2. Translate the problem into an equation.
3. Solve the equation for the variable.
4. Calculate the required percentage of the obtained value.
