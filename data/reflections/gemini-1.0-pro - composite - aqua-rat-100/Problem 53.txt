Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the system of equations. I incorrectly solved for x and y, resulting in the wrong answer.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - System of equations error
 - Solution error
Solution:
Let's assume Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.
From the first statement, we can write the equation: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
From the second statement, we can write the equation: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Simplifying the equations:
y + 30 = 2x - 60
x + 10 = 3y - 30
Solving for x and y:
x = 2y - 40
y = (x + 40)/3
Substituting the value of y in the first equation:
x = 2((x + 40)/3) - 40
3x = 2x + 80 - 120
x = 62
Substituting the value of x in the second equation:
y = (62 + 40)/3
y = 34
Instructions:
1. Assign variables to represent the unknowns.
2. Write equations based on the given information.
3. Simplify the equations to make them easier to solve.
4. Solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination.
5. Check your solution by substituting the values back into the original equations.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated values.
Advice:
 - Be careful when manipulating equations, especially when substituting variables.
 - Double-check your calculations and solutions to avoid errors.
 - Consider using different methods to solve the system of equations to verify your answer.
 - If you get stuck, try breaking down the problem into smaller steps or seeking help from others.
