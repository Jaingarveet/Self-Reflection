I made a mistake in my calculation of the cost price and the profit percentage.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Profit calculation error
Solution:
Cost price = 27.50 / (100 + 10) * 100 = 25
Selling price = 25.75
Profit = 25.75 - 25 = 0.75
Profit percentage = (0.75 / 25) * 100 = 3%
Instructions:
1. Identify the selling price and profit percentage.
2. Calculate the cost price using the formula: Cost price = Selling price / (100 + profit percentage) * 100
3. Calculate the new selling price.
4. Calculate the profit or loss using the formula: Profit/Loss = New selling price - Cost price
5. Calculate the profit or loss percentage using the formula: Profit/Loss percentage = (Profit/Loss / Cost price) * 100
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated profit or loss percentage.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price, not the selling price.
