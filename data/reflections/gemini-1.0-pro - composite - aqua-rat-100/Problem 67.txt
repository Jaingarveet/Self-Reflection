Explanation:
I made a mistake in setting up the proportion. I incorrectly assumed that 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] rolls, when in fact, 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] rolls. This led to an incorrect final answer.
Error Keywords:
- Proportion error
- Misinterpretation of problem
- Incorrect assumption
Solution:
Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
Let x be the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
[REDACTED] baguettes = x pita breads
Combining these proportions, we get:
(6 pita breads) / ([REDACTED] rolls) = ([REDACTED] rolls) / (5 baguettes) = ([REDACTED] baguettes) / (x pita breads)
Cross-multiplying, we get:
(6 pita breads) * (5 baguettes) * (x pita breads) = ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] baguettes)
Simplifying, we get:
[REDACTED]0x = 1[REDACTED]
x = 1[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]0 = [REDACTED]/5
Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED]/5 pita breads.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the relationships between the different items.
[REDACTED]. Set up proportions based on the given information.
[REDACTED]. Make sure the proportions are set up correctly, reflecting the actual relationships.
4. Cross-multiply the proportions to eliminate common factors.
