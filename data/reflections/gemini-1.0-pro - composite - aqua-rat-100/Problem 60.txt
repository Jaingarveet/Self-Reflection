Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED]. 
I correctly calculated the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] but then added it to the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] instead of subtracting it. 
I made a careless error in my calculations.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
Points [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of a circle.
Minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150°.
If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]/2 = [REDACTED].
Minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] - minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] - 150° = -70°.
Since the measure of a minor arc cannot be negative, we add 360° to get the positive measure of minor arc A[REDACTED]:
Minor arc A[REDACTED] = -70° + 360° = 290°.
Instructions:
1. Identify the given information about the circle and its arcs.
2. Determine the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] based on the fact that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED].
3. Calculate the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by subtracting the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] from the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
4. If the result is negative, add 360° to obtain the positive measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the measure of a minor arc is always positive, even if the result of your initial calculation is negative.
