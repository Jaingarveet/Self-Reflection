Explanation:
My initial approach was to set up an equation based on the given information and solve for the unknown variable. However, I made a mistake in interpreting the information and setting up the equation. I assumed that the four friends who did not turn up were part of the original group that planned to spend Rs. 96, which led to an incorrect calculation.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of information
- Incorrect equation setup
- Calculation error
Solution:
Let the number of friends who attended the picnic be x.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Four friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
This means that the remaining friends contributed a total of Rs. 4(x - 4) extra.
The total amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 + Rs. 4(x - 4).
Since the total amount spent was Rs. 96, we can set up the equation:
96 = 96 + 4(x - 4)
Simplifying the equation:
0 = 4(x - 4)
0 = x - 4
x = 4
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the given information.
2. Identify the unknowns and what you are trying to find.
3. Set up an equation that accurately represents the relationship between the given information and the unknowns.
4. Solve the equation for the unknown variable.
5. Check your answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
6. Be mindful of any assumptions you make and ensure they are valid.
General Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem and avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure your equation accurately reflects the given information.
- Consider different approaches to solving the problem and choose the one that makes the most sense.
- Be mindful of common errors, such as misinterpreting information or setting up incorrect equations.
