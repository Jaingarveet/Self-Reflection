Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the probability of neither event occurring. 
I correctly calculated the probability of each event occurring but then incorrectly calculated the probability of neither event occurring.
Error Keywords:
 - Probability error
 - Calculation error
 - Logic error
Solution:
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the probability that both stocks will decrease in value.
The probability that both stocks will decrease in value is the product of the probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value and the probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value is 1 - 0.74 = [REDACTED].
The probability that both stocks will decrease in value is 0.44 * [REDACTED] = 0.1144.
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.1144 = 0.8856.
Instructions:
1. Identify the probability of each event occurring.
2. Calculate the probability of neither event occurring by subtracting the probability of both events occurring from 1.
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the probability of neither event occurring is the complement of the probability of both events occurring.
