Explanation:
I made a mistake in simplifying the expression for the difference between the two fractions. 
I incorrectly subtracted the fractions 1/8 and 1/18, which resulted in an incorrect value for the difference.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Fraction simplification error
 - Difference calculation error
Solution:
Let the number be x.
7/8 of x = 7x/8
7/18 of x = 7x/18
Difference = 7x/8 - 7x/18 = 770
7x(1/8 - 1/18) = 770
7x(5/72) = 770
x = 770 * 72 / 7 * 5
x = [REDACTED]
Instructions:
1. Let the unknown number be x.
2. Express the given fractions of x in terms of x.
3. Calculate the difference between the two fractions.
4. Simplify the expression for the difference.
5. Solve the equation for x.
6. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the details of the problem and the relationships between the given quantities.
 - Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with fractions.
 - Double-check your calculations at each step to avoid errors.
 - Consider using alternative methods or representations to verify your solution.
