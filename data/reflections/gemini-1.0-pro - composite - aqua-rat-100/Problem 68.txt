Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the other integer as a multiple of 11. 
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the relationship between the GCF, LCM, and the two integers. 
I knew the correct GCF and LCM but made a mistake in identifying the other integer.
Error Keywords:
 - Misidentification
 - Integer relationship
 - GCF and LCM relationship
Solution:
The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11.
The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700.
If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
The product of the two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.
Therefore, the other integer is equal to the product of the LCM and the GCF divided by the known integer.
The other integer is equal to 7700 * 11 / 350 = [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the GCF and LCM of the two integers.
2. Identify one of the integers.
3. Calculate the product of the GCF and LCM.
4. Divide the product of the GCF and LCM by the known integer to find the other integer.
5. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:
 - Remember that the product of two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.
 - Remember that the GCF is a factor of both integers, while the LCM is a multiple of both integers.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
