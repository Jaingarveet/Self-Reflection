Advice:
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
- Analyze all constraints carefully and understand their implications.
- Build a logical sequence step-by-step, considering all elements and their relationships.
- Evaluate each answer choice systematically against the constructed logical sequence.
- Do not jump to conclusions based on limited information or individual constraints.
- Consider the overall structure and logical flow of the problem.
