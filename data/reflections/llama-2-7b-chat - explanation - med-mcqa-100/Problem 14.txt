Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. The correct end product of anaerobic glycolysis is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

I misunderstood the question and thought that the end product was [REDACTED]H, which is the product of aerobic glycolysis. In anaerobic glycolysis, there is no electron transport chain and no production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, so the end product is simply [REDACTED].
