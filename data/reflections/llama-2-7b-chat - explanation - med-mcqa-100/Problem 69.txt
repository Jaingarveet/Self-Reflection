Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the deficiency as cysteine, but the correct answer is tryptophan.

The clinical features described in the question, such as "itching, particularly on the face and genitalia," "urticaria," and "fatigue," are indeed consistent with a deficiency in tryptophan. [REDACTED] is an essential amino acid that is important for the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and other physiological processes. [REDACTED] deficiency in tryptophan can lead to these clinical features.
