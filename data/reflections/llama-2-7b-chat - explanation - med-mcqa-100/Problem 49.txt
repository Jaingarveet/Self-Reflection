Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as "[REDACTED]" when the correct answer is "[REDACTED]".

The ideal bicarbonate buffer in blood is because bicarbonate acts as a weak acid and weak base combination. This means that it can donate a proton (H+) to the blood, which helps to maintain the blood pH within a narrow range. Additionally, bicarbonate is a common ion in the blood, which means it helps to balance the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood.
