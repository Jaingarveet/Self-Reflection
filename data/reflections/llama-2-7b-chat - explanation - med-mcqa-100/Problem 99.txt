Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the principal site of acidification of urine as the loop of Henle, when in fact it is the collecting duct.

The loop of Henle is a part of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney, and it is involved in the reabsorption of water and ions. However, the acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct, which is the final part of the nephron where the urine is concentrated and prepared for excretion.
