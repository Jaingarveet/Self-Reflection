Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation when answering the question. I calculated the pH using the formula pH = -log[H+], but I forgot to take into account the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-).

The correct calculation for the pH of the solution is:

pH = -log[H+] - log[OH-]

Since the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) is not given, we can assume that it is negligible compared to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). Therefore, the pH of the solution can be calculated as:

pH = -log(1 x 10-6) = -6 - log(0) = -6

So, the pH of the solution is [REDACTED], which is 6.
