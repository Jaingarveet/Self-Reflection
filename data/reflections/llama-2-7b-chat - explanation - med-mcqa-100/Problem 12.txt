Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as [REDACTED], [REDACTED], when in fact the correct answer is [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

The reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about the requirement of aminoacyl tRN[REDACTED] for the translation of a specific amino acid, [REDACTED]. However, the question is actually asking about the requirement of aminoacyl tRN[REDACTED] for the translation of any amino acid, and the correct answer is [REDACTED].
