Explanation:
I incorrectly selected option [REDA[REDACTED]ED], [REDACTED], as the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis.

The correct answer is option [REDA[REDACTED]ED], [REDA[REDACTED]ED] (Ultrasound). [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is the investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis in children under 1 year of age, as it is non-invasive and can accurately diagnose the condition. [REDA[REDACTED]ED] (option B) and [REDACTED] (option D) are not suitable for diagnosing pyloric stenosis in young children.
