Explanation:

I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia. I selected Choice (C) as the correct answer, but upon further analysis, I realize that it is not the correct answer.

The correct answer is Choice (A): Increased TIB[REDACTED], decreased serum ferritin, Transferrin ferritin index >1. This is because iron deficiency anemia is characterized by decreased iron stores in the body, which can lead to decreased production of red blood cells. An increase in transferrin saturation (TIBC) and serum ferritin levels, along with a Transferrin ferritin index >1, are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.
