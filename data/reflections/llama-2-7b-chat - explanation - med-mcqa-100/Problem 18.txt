Explanation:
I incorrectly identified [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as the choices that decrease appetite. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

[REDACTED] is a hormone produced by fat cells that plays a key role in regulating energy balance and appetite. [REDACTED] signals to the brain that the body has enough energy stores, which can decrease appetite and increase fat burning. In contrast, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are involved in regulating sleep and wakefulness, but they do not directly affect appetite.
