Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as "[REDACTED]" (Hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets is a disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb vitamin [REDACTED] and phosphorus).

The correct answer is "[REDACTED]" (Hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to absorb vitamin [REDACTED] and phosphorus, leading to softening of the bones (osteomalacia) or abnormal bone growth (rachitis)).

I made this mistake because I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about a different condition. I should have read the question more carefully and understood that it was asking about a specific medical condition.
