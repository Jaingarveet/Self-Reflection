Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the most probable diagnosis for the neonate's chest X-ray.

The chest X-ray shows a large ventricular septal defect ([REDACTED]), which is the most probable diagnosis. The other options, tetralogy of Fallot ([REDACTED]), atrial septal defect (ASD), and transposition of the great arteries ([REDACTED]), are less likely given the patient's age and symptoms.
