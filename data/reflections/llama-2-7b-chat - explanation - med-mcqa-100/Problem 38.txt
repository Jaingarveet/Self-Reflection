Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the answer to the question. The correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].

The "Cobra snake head" appearance is a radiological sign that refers to the characteristic shape of the ureterocele, which is a congenital abnormality of the urinary tract. It appears as a well-defined, rounded mass with a "cobra snake head" shape on a plain abdominal X-ray.

I misunderstood the question and selected the incorrect answer. My mistake was due to a lack of attention to detail and a failure to thoroughly understand the question.
