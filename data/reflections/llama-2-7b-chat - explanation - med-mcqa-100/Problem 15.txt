Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], when in fact the commonest cause for grommet insertion is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

[REDACTED] is the most common indication for grommet insertion, accounting for approximately 70% of all cases. [REDACTED], on the other hand, is a less common cause for grommet insertion, accounting for around 20% of cases.
