Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake earlier. I misunderstood the term "suggilation" and provided an incorrect answer.

Suggilation is indeed a term used in forensic medicine to describe the staining of the body after death, particularly the face and neck, due to the settling of blood and other fluids.

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
