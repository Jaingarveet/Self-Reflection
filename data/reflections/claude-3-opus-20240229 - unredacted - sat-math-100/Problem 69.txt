Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning when setting up the equation. I tried to calculate the new number of miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his expenditure by $5, but I set up the equation incorrectly. Instead of equating the cost of the reduced miles to the desired reduction of $5, I equated it to the new total expenditure of $11.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect equation setup
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Logical error in problem-solving
Solution:
1) Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week.
2) His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
3) Gasoline costs $4 per gallon.
4) Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5.
5) Let $m$ be the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.
6) The cost of driving these $m$ miles should be equal to the desired reduction of $5:
   - (Miles reduced / Miles per gallon) * Price per gallon = Desired reduction
   - ($m$ / 25) * $4 = $5
7) Simplify:
   - $m$ / 25 = 5 / 4
   - $m$ = 125 / 4
   - $m$ = 31.25
8) This matches the equation in choice D: $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$
Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the key information.
2. Identify the unknown variable and what it represents.
3. Set up an equation based on the relationship between the unknown variable and the desired outcome.
4. In the equation, the left side should represent the cost or effect of the unknown variable.
5. The right side of the equation should be the desired outcome or change.
6. Solve the equation for the unknown variable.
7. Check if your solution matches one of the given choices.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify what the question is asking for.
 - Clearly define your variables and what they represent.
 - Make sure your equation correctly represents the relationship between the variables and the desired outcome.
 - The desired outcome or change should be on one side of the equation by itself.
 - Double-check your equation setup before solving.
 - If your solution doesn't match any of the choices, revisit your equation setup.
