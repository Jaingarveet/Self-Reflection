Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I thought that because there were two unknowns (x and y) and only one equation, it would be impossible to determine the value of the expression. However, I failed to recognize that the expression $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ can be simplified to $2^{3x-y}$, which is exactly the left-hand side of the given equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, the value of the expression can be determined.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking key information
 - Incomplete simplification
 - Misinterpreting the problem
 - Failing to connect related expressions
Solution:
Given the equation $3x - y = 12$, let's solve for the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.
First, simplify the expression:
$\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
Now, we can see that the exponent $3x-y$ is the same as the left-hand side of the given equation. 
Substituting the right-hand side of the equation:
$2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is $2^{12}$.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the given information and the question.
2. Simplify the expression in the question as much as possible.
3. Look for connections between the simplified expression and the given equation.
4. If the simplified expression matches part of the equation, substitute the corresponding value from the equation.
5. Evaluate the resulting expression to find the answer.
Advice:
 - Always simplify expressions as much as possible to reveal potential connections.
 - Look for ways to relate the expression you're trying to evaluate to the given information.
 - Don't assume you can't solve a problem just because there are multiple unknowns. Sometimes the solution doesn't require finding the values of all the unknowns.
 - If an expression in the question matches part of a given equation, consider substituting the corresponding value from the equation.
