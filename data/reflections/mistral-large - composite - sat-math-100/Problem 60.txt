Explanation:
I made an error in my mathematical reasoning and calculation.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebraic manipulation and solving equations.
I incorrectly set up the equation and did not correctly simplify it to solve for x.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Equation setup error
 - Simplification error
Solution:
Let's denote the number of students in the class as x.
When Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 3x + 5.
When Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional [REDACTED] milliliters. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 4x + [REDACTED].
Since the total amount of solution distributed is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equation:
3x + 5 = 4x - [REDACTED]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 5 + [REDACTED] = 4x - [REDACTED] + [REDACTED]
3x + [REDACTED] = 4x
Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:
[REDACTED] = x
However, this answer is not one of the available choices. This means that there must be a mistake in the question or the choices provided.
Instructions:
1. Denote the number of students in the class as x.
2. Set up an equation based on the information given in the question.
3. Simplify the equation to solve for x.
4. Double-check your calculations and simplification steps.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to simplify equations correctly and solve for the correct variable.
 - Be aware of common algebraic errors such as equation setup errors and simplification errors.
