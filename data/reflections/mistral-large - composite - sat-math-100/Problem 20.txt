Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the value of x.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the concept of solving systems of equations but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct method to solve the system of equations but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
The system of equations is:
$2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$
$1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
First, we can multiply the first equation by 4 to eliminate the decimal points:
$9.6 x - 6 y = 1.2$
Then, we can multiply the second equation by 3 to eliminate the decimal points:
$4.8 x + 1.5 y = -3.9$
Next, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations:
$9.6 x + 3 y = -7.8$
Now, we can subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate y:
$-3 y = 9$
$y = -3$
Substitute y = -3 into the first equation to solve for x:
$2.4 x - 1.5(-3) = 0.3$
$2.4 x + 4.5 = 0.3$
$2.4 x = -4.2$
$x = -[REDACTED]$
However, we need to round the value of x to the nearest tenth to match the answer choices:
$x \approx -1.8$
The answer choice that matches our calculated result is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the system of equations.
2. Choose a method to solve the system of equations (substitution or elimination).
3. Multiply the equations by appropriate values to eliminate decimal points and make the coefficients of one variable the same in both equations.
4. Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.
5. Solve for the remaining variable.
6. Substitute the value of the variable back into one of the equations to solve for the other variable.
7. Round the values of the variables to the nearest tenth to match the answer choices.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to round the values of the variables to the nearest tenth to match the answer choices.
