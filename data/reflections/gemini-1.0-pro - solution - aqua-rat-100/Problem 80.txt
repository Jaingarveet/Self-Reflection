Solution:
Let the cost of each brown sharpener be x rupees.
Then the cost of each white sharpener is (x + 1) rupees.
The total cost of the white sharpeners is x * (x + 1).
The total cost of the brown sharpeners is (18 - x) * x.
The total cost of the sharpeners is rs. 100.
So, x * (x + 1) + (18 - x) * x = 100.
Simplifying the equation, we get x^2 + 18x - 100 = 0.
Factoring the equation, we get (x - 5)(x + 20) = 0.
Solving for x, we get x = 5 or x = -20.
Since the cost of a sharpener cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -20.
Therefore, the cost of each brown sharpener is rs. 5.
The cost of each white sharpener is rs. 6.
The number of white sharpeners is 100 / 6 = 16.66, which we round down to 10.
The number of brown sharpeners is 18 - 10 = 8.
