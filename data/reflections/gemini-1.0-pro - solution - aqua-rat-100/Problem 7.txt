Solution:
Amy has [REDACTED] different types of books.
She can use single letters to represent up to 26 different types of books.
Since she has fewer than 26 types of books, she can use single letters for all of them.
Therefore, she needs only [REDACTED] letters to create the codes for all [REDACTED] types of books.
