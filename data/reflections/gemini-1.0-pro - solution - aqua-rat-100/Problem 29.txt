Solution:
1. Calculate the net progress the frog makes each day: 3 meters up - 2 meters down = 1 meter.
2. Calculate the number of days it takes the frog to reach the top of the well, excluding the final day: 30 meters / 1 meter/day = 30 days.
3. On the final day, the frog only needs to jump 1 meter to reach the top.
4. Therefore, it will take the frog 30 days - 1 day = [REDACTED] to come out of the well.
