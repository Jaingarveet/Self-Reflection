Solution:
8 men can complete the work in 6 days.
To complete the same work in 1/2 day, we need to find the number of men required.
Let x be the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day.
Using the concept of inverse proportionality, we can set up the following equation:
8 * 6 = x * 1/2
Solving for x, we get:
x = 8 * 6 * 2 = [REDACTED]
