Solution:
R, S, T, and U are points on a line, and U is the midpoint of line segment ST.
The lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 1[REDACTED], and 22, respectively.
Since U is the midpoint of line segment ST, the length of line segment SU is half the length of line segment ST, which is 22/2 = 11.
The length of line segment RU is the difference between the lengths of line segments RT and SU, which is 1[REDACTED] - 11 = [REDACTED].
