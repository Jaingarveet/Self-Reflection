Solution:
Let the number of friends who attended the picnic be x.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Four friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
This means that the remaining friends contributed a total of Rs. 4(x - 4) extra.
The total amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 + Rs. 4(x - 4).
Since the total amount spent was Rs. 96, we can set up the equation:
96 = 96 + 4(x - 4)
Simplifying the equation:
0 = 4(x - 4)
0 = x - 4
x = 4
