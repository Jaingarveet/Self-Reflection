Solution:
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is the probability that both stocks will decrease in value.
The probability that both stocks will decrease in value is the product of the probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value and the probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will decrease in value is 1 - 0.74 = [REDACTED].
The probability that both stocks will decrease in value is 0.44 * [REDACTED] = 0.1144.
The probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.1144 = 0.8856.
