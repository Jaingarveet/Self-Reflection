Solution:
Let's denote the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as x.
The time it took Kevin to travel from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] is x/70 hours.
The time it took Kevin to travel from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] is x/[REDACTED] hours.
The total time of the trip is x/70 + x/[REDACTED] = 6 hours.
Three hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from [REDACTED], which means he had already traveled x - 70 miles.
Therefore, the time it took him to travel x - 70 miles is (x - 70)/70 hours.
We know that this time is 3 hours less than the total time of the trip, which is 6 - 3 = 3 hours.
So, (x - 70)/70 = 3
x - 70 = 210
x = 280 miles
