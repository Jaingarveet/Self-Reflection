Solution:
The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11.
The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700.
If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?
The product of the two integers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.
Therefore, the other integer is equal to the product of the LCM and the GCF divided by the known integer.
The other integer is equal to 7700 * 11 / 350 = [REDACTED].
