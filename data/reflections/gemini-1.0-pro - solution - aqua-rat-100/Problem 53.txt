Solution:
Let's assume Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.
From the first statement, we can write the equation: y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
From the second statement, we can write the equation: x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
Simplifying the equations:
y + 30 = 2x - 60
x + 10 = 3y - 30
Solving for x and y:
x = 2y - 40
y = (x + 40)/3
Substituting the value of y in the first equation:
x = 2((x + 40)/3) - 40
3x = 2x + 80 - 120
x = 62
Substituting the value of x in the second equation:
y = (62 + 40)/3
y = 34
