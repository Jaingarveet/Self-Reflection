Solution:
Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do. Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?
Let x be the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes.
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
[REDACTED] baguettes = x pita breads
Combining these proportions, we get:
(6 pita breads) / ([REDACTED] rolls) = ([REDACTED] rolls) / (5 baguettes) = ([REDACTED] baguettes) / (x pita breads)
Cross-multiplying, we get:
(6 pita breads) * (5 baguettes) * (x pita breads) = ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] rolls) * ([REDACTED] baguettes)
Simplifying, we get:
[REDACTED]0x = 1[REDACTED]
x = 1[REDACTED]/[REDACTED]0 = [REDACTED]/5
Therefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED]/5 pita breads.
