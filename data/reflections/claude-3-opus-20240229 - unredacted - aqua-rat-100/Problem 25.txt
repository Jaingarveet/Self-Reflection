Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation in the final step. I incorrectly simplified the expression for the additional time taken by the car to reach the base of the tower. Instead of 10(3 - √3), the correct simplification is 5(√3 + 1).
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic simplification error
 - Incorrect simplification
 - Calculation mistake
Solution:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the uniform speed of the car be v. 
   Also, let the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.
2) At the start, tan(45°) = h/x. Therefore, x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   Therefore, √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2, we get:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) Now, let's find the additional time taken. If the remaining distance is y, then:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   Therefore, the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying correctly, 10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 10(3/√3 - √3/√3) = 10(√3 - 1) = 5(√3 + 1)
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 5(√3 + 1) more minutes.
