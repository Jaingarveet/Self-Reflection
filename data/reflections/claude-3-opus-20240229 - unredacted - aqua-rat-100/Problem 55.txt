Explanation:
I correctly solved the problem and arrived at the right answer of 6 kmph for the man's speed along the current. However, I selected the wrong multiple choice option. The correct answer was listed as both choice B and choice E, but I only selected B and failed to notice that E was also correct.
Error Keywords:
 - Inattention to detail
 - Incomplete answer checking
 - Duplicate correct answer
Solution:
1. Let the speed of the current be x kmph.
2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.
3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.
4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed
   2 = 4 - x
   x = 4 - 2 = 2
   So, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.
5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed 
                             = 4 + 2 = 6
Therefore, the man's speed along the current is 6 kmph.
Both choice B and choice E are 6 kmph, so either B or E is correct.
Instructions:
