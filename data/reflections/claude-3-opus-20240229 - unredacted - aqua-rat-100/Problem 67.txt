Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning at the final step. I had correctly set up the equations and solved for x, finding that x = 10/9. However, I then incorrectly interpreted this result. The question asked for the number of pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes, but I compared 10/9 to the fractions in the answer choices, looking for the closest value. Instead, I should have multiplied 10/9 by 2 to find the number of pita breads equivalent to 2 baguettes.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of result
 - Failure to consider all relevant information
 - Incomplete solution
 - Lack of answer verification
Solution:
Let p = number of pita breads, r = number of rolls, b = number of baguettes
From the given information:
6p = 2r (six pita breads equal two rolls)
3r = 5b (three rolls equal five baguettes)
We want to find x such that xp = 2b
From the first equation: r = 3p
Substituting into the second equation:
3(3p) = 5b
9p = 5b
Now, we have xp = 2b and 9p = 5b. Solving for x:
xp = 2b
x(9p) = x(5b)
9xp = 10b
9x = 10
x = 10/9
So, 10/9 pita breads equal 1 baguette.
The question asks for the number of pita breads equal to 2 baguettes.
Therefore, we multiply 10/9 by 2:
(10/9) * 2 = 20/9 â‰ˆ 2.22
Rounding 20/9 to the nearest whole number gives 2.
The correct answer is C: 2 baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 3 pita breads.
