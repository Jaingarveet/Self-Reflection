Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the narrator's personality based on specific details in the passage. 
While the narrator does observe her surroundings and takes pride in her family's ink, she also displays shyness and hesitation when interacting with unfamiliar people. 
My focus on specific details caused me to overlook the broader context of the narrator's interactions.
