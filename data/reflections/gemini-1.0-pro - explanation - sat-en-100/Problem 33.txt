Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the key difference between Eppie and Silas's gold. 
I focused on the physical characteristics of the gold, such as its durability and protection, instead of its symbolic meaning. 
The passage emphasizes Eppie's vitality and her ability to bring joy and change into Silas's life, in contrast to the gold's static and isolating nature.
