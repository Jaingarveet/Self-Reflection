Lady Carlotta is introduced to the Quabarl children and learns about their personalities and interests. The narrator describes them as "delicate, sensitive young people" and "children of that class and type in the twentieth century." This suggests that they are not particularly unique or exceptional, but rather typical of their age and social class.
