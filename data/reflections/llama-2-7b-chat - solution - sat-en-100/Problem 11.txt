Solution:

* We can calculate the percent of colonies with CC[REDACTED] that were infected by all four pathogens by adding the percent of colonies infected by each of the four pathogens together.
* According to the table, [REDACTED] of colonies with CC[REDACTED] were infected by IAPV, [REDACTED] were infected by KBV, 9[REDACTED] were infected by Nosema apis, and 48 percent were infected by Nosema ceranae.
* Therefore, the percent of colonies with CC[REDACTED] that were infected by all four pathogens is: 83 + 77 + 90 + 48 = 358.
* So, the percent of colonies with CC[REDACTED] that were infected by all four pathogens is 358/100 = 35.8 percent.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].
