Explanation:
The passage begins by discussing the narrator's love of reading and how it served as a refuge from their troubled home life. It then shifts to a specific incident where the narrator's father discovers their reading habit and tears a book from their hands, throwing it out the window. Following this, the narrator describes their favorite bookshop and how the bookseller there allows them to read books for free and even gifts them a volume of Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations." The passage culminates in the narrator expressing their desire to learn to write like Dickens.

Therefore, the main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading (option A) to a portrayal of an influential incident where the narrator receives a meaningful gift from the bookseller (option A).
