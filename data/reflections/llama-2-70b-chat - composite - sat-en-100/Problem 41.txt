Explanation:
According to Hodick and Sievers' model, the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.

In choice [REDACTED], the large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably. This means that the calcium ion concentration in the trap has decreased over time, and it may not be high enough to close the trap even if a second hair is touched. Therefore, the Venus flytrap will not close around the insect in this scenario.

The other choices do not describe scenarios in which the Venus flytrap will not close around an insect. In choice [REDACTED], the large insect's second contact with the plant's trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap's threshold, which means the trap will close. In choice [REDACTED], the large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap, which is a necessary step for the trap to close. In choice [REDACTED], the large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair, which is within the time frame required for the trap to close.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED].
