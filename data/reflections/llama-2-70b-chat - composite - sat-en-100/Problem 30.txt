Explanation:
In Passage 1, Tocqueville implies that treating men and women as identical in nature would harm both sexes. He argues that attempting to make one sex equal to the other by giving them the same functions, duties, and rights would result in weak men and disorderly women. He believes that nature intended for men and women to have distinct employment for their various faculties, and that improvement lies in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
