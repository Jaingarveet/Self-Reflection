Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women have a subordinate relationship to men in society, but this does not mean that their duties or influence are any less important. He states that women are designed to gain influence and exercise power differently than men, specifically through "the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles" and by making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved.
