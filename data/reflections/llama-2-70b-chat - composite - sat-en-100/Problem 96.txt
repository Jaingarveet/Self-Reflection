Explanation:
The passage implies that pelicans, storks, and geese, like ibises, fly in a V formation, as the author states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. However, the author does not mention anything about their communication methods, migration routes, or energy expenditure, so options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are not implied by the passage. Therefore, the best answer is [REDACTED], as the passage suggests that these birds create a similar wake to that of ibises, which allows them to fly efficiently in a V formation.
