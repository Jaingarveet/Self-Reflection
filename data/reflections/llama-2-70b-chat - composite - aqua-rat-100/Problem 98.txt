Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula for simple interest and calculated the total amount instead of the simple interest.

Error Keywords:

* Formula error
* Calculation error
* Simple interest error

Solution:
Let's recalculate the simple interest using the correct formula:
SI = P x R x T
SI = 500 x 6% x 4
SI = [REDACTED]

Now, the total amount that Rahul will pay is the sum of the principal amount and the simple interest.
Total = P + SI
Total = 500 + [REDACTED]
Total = 1100

Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for simple interest.
2. Plug in the values for principal amount, interest rate, and time.
3. Calculate the simple interest.
4. Add the principal amount to the simple interest to get the total amount.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated total amount.

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations, especially when working with formulas.
* Make sure you understand the formula and how to apply it correctly.
* Take your time and work step-by-step through the problem.
* Don't let mistakes in previous questions affect your confidence in solving future questions.
