Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], but I incorrectly concluded that the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:

* Reasoning error
* Misapplication of concept
* Incorrect conclusion

Solution:
Points [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150Â°. Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED]. Therefore, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Identify the fact that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED].
2. Recognize that the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED].
3. Calculate the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by subtracting the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] from [REDACTED].
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].

Advice:

* Always carefully analyze the given information and identify the relevant facts.
* Apply the concepts and formulas appropriately.
* Double-check your calculations and conclusions.
* Consider all the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options.
* Practice similar problems to improve your problem-solving skills.
