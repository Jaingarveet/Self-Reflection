Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I correctly identified the GCF and LCM of 350 and 7700, but I made a mistake in factoring 7700 to find the other integer.
I mistakenly factored 7700 as 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7, when in reality, it can also be factored as 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7.
This mistake led me to choose [REDACTED] as the other integer, when in reality, it should have been [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Factoring mistake
* Incorrect calculation

Solution:

1. Determine the prime factorization of 350: 350 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7
2. Determine the prime factorization of 7700: 7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7
3. Identify the common prime factors between 350 and 7700: 2, 5, and 7
4. Determine the GCF of 350 and 7700: GCF = 2 x 5 x 7 = 11
5. Determine the LCM of 350 and 7700: LCM = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 = 7700
6. Find the other integer by factoring 7700: 7700 = 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7

The other integer is 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7 = [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Identify the GCF and LCM of the two given integers.
2. Factor the LCM to find the other integer.
3. Check your calculation by verifying that the product of the two integers is equal to the LCM.

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Make sure to consider all possible factorizations of a number before making a conclusion.
* Use a systematic approach to factoring, such as factoring by prime factors or common factors.
* Take your time and work carefully through each step of the problem.
