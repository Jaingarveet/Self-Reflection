Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the problem.
I thought the question was asking for the ratio of work done by x men to work done by y men, but it's actually asking for the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.
My mistake was not taking into account the time factor in the problem.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding the problem
- Lack of attention to detail
- Failure to consider all relevant factors
Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.
2. y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.
3. We want to find the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.
4. We can set up a proportion using the rates:
x/x = y/y
x2/x2 = y2/y2
5. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the relevant information given in the problem.
3. Set up a proportion using the rates given in the problem.
4. Solve for the missing variable.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked.
- Pay attention to all relevant factors given in the problem.
- Use a systematic approach to solve the problem, such as setting up a proportion.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Don't assume you know the answer without going through the steps.
