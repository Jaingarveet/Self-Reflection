Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the profit percentage.
I calculated the profit as 1% instead of 3%.
The correct calculation is:
Profit = (New selling price - Cost price) / Cost price
= (25.75 - 24.75) / 24.75
= 3%

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Percentage error
- Profit calculation error

Solution:
Let's first calculate the cost price of the book.

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
= 27.50 - 10% of 27.50
= 27.50 - 2.75
= 24.75

Now, let's calculate the new selling price.

New selling price = 25.75

Profit = New selling price - Cost price
= 25.75 - 24.75
= 3%

Since the profit is 3%, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Calculate the cost price of the book.
2. Calculate the new selling price.
3. Calculate the profit percentage.
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated profit percentage.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that profit is calculated as a percentage of the cost price, not the selling price.
