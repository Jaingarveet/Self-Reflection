Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by identifying the wrong number as a perfect square.
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which is a perfect square (7^2).
I made a mistake in my calculation and identified 111 as a perfect square, when in fact it is not.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Square root error
- Perfect square error

Solution:
[REDACTED] consecutive sequence of 5 odd numbers: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], 89, 111, 133
When divided by 10: 4.7, 6.7, 8.9, 11.1, 13.3
Square root of 4.7= 2.1, 6.7= 2.6, 8.9= 3.1, 11.1= 3.3, 13.3= 3.6
Only one of the given numbers is a perfect square, which is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the consecutive sequence of 5 odd numbers.
2. Divide each number by 10.
3. Calculate the square root of each result.
4. Identify the number that is a perfect square.
5. Choose the corresponding answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Make sure you understand the concept of perfect squares and how to identify them.
- Be careful when comparing numbers and identifying which one is a perfect square.
- Take your time and work through each step of the problem carefully.
- Remember that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, for example, [REDACTED] = 7^2.
