Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I divided the total profit by the profit per bag, but I forgot to round up the result to the nearest whole number.
The correct calculation is: $3,000 รท $25 = [REDACTED]0 bags (rounded up to [REDACTED]1 bags).
Error Keywords:
- Rounding error
- Calculation error
- Math mistake
Solution:
[REDACTED] grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for $100 and makes $3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell?
Let's break this down step by step:
1. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour. This means that the profit per bag is 25% of $100, or $25.
2. The total profit is $3,000.
3. To find the number of bags sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $3,000 รท $25 = [REDACTED]0 bags (rounded up to [REDACTED]1 bags).
So, the grocer sold [REDACTED]1 bags of flour.
Instructions:
1. Identify the profit per bag.
2. Calculate the total number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag.
3. Round up the result to the nearest whole number.
