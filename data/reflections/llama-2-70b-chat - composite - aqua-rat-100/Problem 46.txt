Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the percentage given in the question and calculated 12 1/2% of X instead of 12 1/2% of the man's income.

Error Keywords:

* Percentage error
* Calculation error
* Misunderstanding of the question

Solution:
Let X be the monthly income of the man.

We know that he spends Rs. 3500 per month, so his savings are:
S = X - 3500

We are also given that he saves 12 1/2% of his income, so:
S = 0.125X

Now, we can set up the equation:
0.125X - 3500 = 12 1/2% of X

Simplifying, we get:
0.125X = 4000

Dividing both sides by 0.125, we get:
X = 32,000

So, the man's monthly income is Rs. 32,000.

Instructions:

1. Let X be the monthly income of the man.
2. Calculate his savings using the formula: S = X - 3500.
3. Calculate the percentage of his income that he saves using the formula: S = 0.125X.
4. Set up an equation using the two formulas.
5. Simplify the equation to find X.
6. Calculate the man's monthly income using X.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* When working with percentages, be careful to calculate the correct percentage of the correct value.
