Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed incorrectly.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Misunderstanding the question
- Confusion between percentages
Solution:
Let's first find the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored.
[REDACTED] of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so 90% are vanilla flavored.
Now, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed.
90% of the rest (which means 90% - [REDACTED] = 80%) are squashed.
So, the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed is 20%.
Now, we need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
To do this, we multiply the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored (90%) by the percentage of chocolates that are not squashed (20%).
90% x 20% = 18%.
