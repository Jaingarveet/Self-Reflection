Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by Kevin.
I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled as 420 miles, when in fact it was [REDACTED] miles.
This mistake was due to a misapplication of the formula:

Distance = Time x Speed

I applied this formula incorrectly, using the speed of 70 mph for both the distance traveled to [REDACTED] and the distance traveled back to [REDACTED].
However, the correct speed for the distance traveled back to [REDACTED] should have been [REDACTED] mph.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Formula misapplication
 - Speed mistake
Solution:
Kevin drove from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] at a constant speed of 70 mph.
The time it took him to reach [REDACTED] is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70

The distance traveled to [REDACTED] is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70

Since he turned right around and returned to [REDACTED] at a constant speed of [REDACTED] mph, the time it took him to return to [REDACTED] is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED]

The distance traveled back to [REDACTED] is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled to [REDACTED] and the distance traveled back to [REDACTED]:

Total distance = Distance to [REDACTED] + Distance back to A
Total distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70 + [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
Total distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70 + [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]

Now, let's look at the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too small
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too small
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too small
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too large
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Incorrect, there is a valid answer

The correct answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")

Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for distance traveled:
Distance = Time x Speed
2. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled to [REDACTED]:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70
3. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled back to [REDACTED]:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
4. Calculate the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance to [REDACTED] + Distance back to A
5. Check your answer against the given choices.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the formula for distance traveled is:
Distance = Time x Speed
 - Be careful when applying formulas, ensure the correct variables are used.
