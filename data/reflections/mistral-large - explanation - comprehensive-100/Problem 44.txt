Explanation:
I misinterpreted the objection raised by the critics in the second paragraph. The critics argue that the historical and social circumstances of a culture play an important role in the development of that culture's values, and that these circumstances should be taken into account when studying other cultures. They do not necessarily argue that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
