Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the placement of the books based on the given conditions.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I misunderstood the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, assuming that the bottom shelf must have at least four books.
I also overlooked the possibility that K could be placed on the top shelf with G, leaving room for L to be placed on the middle shelf with I.
