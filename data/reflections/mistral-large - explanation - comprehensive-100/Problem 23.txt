Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the conditions and the choices.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my understanding of the conditions and their implications.
I incorrectly assumed that Theresa must test H on the first day, but the condition only states that Theresa must test H at some point, not necessarily on the first day.
