Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the mode of inheritance with the type of disorder.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the biochemistry of the disorder but in the genetic basis of the disorder.
I knew the correct gene involved but made a mistake in identifying the mode of inheritance.
