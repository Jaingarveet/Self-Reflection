Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the step-by-step process of creating an account and not enough on the specific details provided in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was not in common sense but in reading comprehension.
I did not fully understand the context of the question and the specific information it was asking for.
