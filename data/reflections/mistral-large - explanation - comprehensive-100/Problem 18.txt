Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the robots' abilities based on their mistakes.
The gap in my knowledge was not understanding that the robots could also be unable to recognize both colors and shapes.
I assumed that since robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls, it must be able to recognize colors, but it could also be unable to recognize shapes. Similarly, I assumed that since robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, it must be able to recognize shapes, but it could also be unable to recognize colors.
