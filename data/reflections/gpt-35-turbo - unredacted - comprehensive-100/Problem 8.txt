Explanation:
I used the correct formula but made a calculation error. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in the formula but in basic arithmetic. 
I correctly identified that the combined speed of the two cars is 25 mph (12 mph + 13 mph), but I made a mistake in calculating the time it would take for them to meet.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Addition error
 - Unit error
Solution:
Let's call the time it takes for the two cars to meet "t".
The distance each car travels is equal to the product of its speed and the time it travels.
For the car traveling at 12 mph, the distance it travels is 12t.
For the car traveling at 13 mph, the distance it travels is 13t.
The sum of the distances traveled by both cars is equal to the total distance between them, which is 50 miles.
So we can write the equation:
12t + 13t = 50
25t = 50
t = 2
Therefore, the two cars will meet 2 hours after they begin.
Instructions:
1. Identify the speeds of the two cars.
2. Identify the distance between the two cars.
3. Use the formula distance = speed x time to find the time it takes for each car to travel.
4. Write an equation that relates the distances traveled by both cars.
5. Solve the equation for the time it takes for the two cars to meet.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to use the correct units in your calculations.
