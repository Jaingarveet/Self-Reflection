Reflection:
I incorrectly answered this question by not fully understanding the editorial's argument. I focused too much on the comparison between painting and education and did not consider the main point of the argument. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Focusing on a minor detail
 - Not considering the main point
Solution:
The editorial compares education to painting and states that preparation and application of the primer coat are important steps in painting. The editorial then suggests that a similar approach should be taken in education. The missing statement should support this idea. 
Option E states that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience. This statement supports the idea that proper preparation and foundation are important in education, just as they are in painting. Therefore, Option E logically completes the editorial's argument.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.
2. Identify the main point of the argument.
3. Consider each option and evaluate how it supports or refutes the main point.
4. Choose the option that best supports the main point of the argument.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
 - Identify the main point of the argument.
 - Consider each option and evaluate how it supports or refutes the main point.
 - Choose the option that best supports the main point of the argument.
 - Do not get distracted by minor details or comparisons.
