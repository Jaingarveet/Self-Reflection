Explanation:
I chose option C because it suggests that the salamanders hide under rocks during the day, which could imply that they are not trampled by cattle and sheep. However, this does not necessarily contradict the experts' opinion that trampling is a significant factor in the decline of the salamander population. Option B, on the other hand, suggests that a change in the environment, specifically a decrease in rainfall and groundwater levels, could be a significant factor in the decline of the salamander population. This would raise doubts about the experts' opinion that trampling is the primary cause of the decline. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of options
 - Failure to identify the most relevant option
 - Lack of attention to detail
Solution:
The experts believe that the trampling of cattle and sheep is the primary reason for the decline in the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang. If there is evidence that other factors, such as a change in the environment, are contributing to the decline, it will raise doubts about the experts' opinions. Option B suggests that a decrease in rainfall and groundwater levels could be a significant factor in the decline of the salamander population.
