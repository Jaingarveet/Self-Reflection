Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice A because I did not distribute the $P$ correctly. 
The correct answer is B because we need to isolate $P$ in the given formula. 
Error Keywords:
 - Distribution error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Isolation error
Solution:
$$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$
We need to isolate $P$ in the given formula.
First, we can multiply both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side:
$$m\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1\right)=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} P$$
Next, we can distribute $m$ on the left-hand side:
$$m\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1\right)=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} P$$
$$m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m=\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N} P$$
Finally, we can isolate $P$ by dividing both sides by $\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}$:
$$P=\frac{m\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-m}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}$$
Therefore, the answer is B.
