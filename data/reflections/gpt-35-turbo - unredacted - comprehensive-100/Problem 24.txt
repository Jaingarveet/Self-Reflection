 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooking conditions
Solution:
We need to determine which students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
George can only give a report on Tuesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the only students left are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
If Nina does not give a report, then there is no need for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
Monday: Olivia and Robert
Tuesday: George and Helen
Wednesday: Irving and Nina
