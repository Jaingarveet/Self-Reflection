Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the sequence of events in the passage. I focused on the anomaly observed by Ken Dial and the new hypothesis he proposed, but I overlooked the fact that the initial experiment was modified due to an unexpected finding.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Sequence of events
- Passage interpretation
Solution:
The passage starts with Ken Dial observing young birds' behavior and designing an experiment to study it. However, an unexpected finding (the birds using their legs instead of flying) arises during the early phase of the study. This leads to a modification of the study (adding hay bales for the birds to perch on). The results of the modified study are then interpreted and evaluated, leading to the proposal of a new hypothesis about bird flight. This sequence of events aligns with choice [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully to understand the sequence of events.
2. Identify the initial observation or problem.
3. Identify any unexpected findings or changes in the study.
4. Identify how the study was modified in response to these findings.
5. Identify the interpretation and evaluation of the results.
6. Match the sequence of events in the passage to the choices given.
7. Choose the answer that best reflects the overall sequence of events in the passage.
Advice:
- Always read the passage carefully and understand the sequence of events.
- Pay attention to any changes or modifications in the study or experiment.
- Understand how the results of the study are interpreted and evaluated.
- Match the sequence of events in the passage to the choices given.
- Choose the answer that best reflects the overall sequence of events in the passage.
