Explanation:
I misread the table and incorrectly identified the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. I chose IAPV, which had a high percentage, but not the highest. The correct answer is [REDACTED], which infected all colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Data analysis error
- Table reading error
Solution:
The table shows the percentage of colonies infected by each pathogen in colonies without colony collapse disorder. The pathogen that infected the highest percentage of colonies is [REDACTED], which infected all colonies without colony collapse disorder.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand what is being asked.
2. Look at the table and identify the relevant column for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
3. Compare the percentages of colonies infected by each pathogen.
4. Identify the pathogen with the highest percentage of infection.
5. Choose the answer that matches the identified pathogen.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Pay close attention to the details in tables and graphs.
