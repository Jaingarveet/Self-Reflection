Explanation:
My mistake was in assuming that F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves if G is placed on the top shelf. However, the problem only states that at least two books are placed on each shelf, not that all books are placed on the middle and bottom shelves. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misreading the problem
 - Overgeneralization
Solution:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then at least two books are placed on each shelf. 
I is placed on the middle shelf, so at least one book is placed on the bottom shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf with L, M, and O.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L and M.
F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the same shelf as K or O.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
Top shelf: G, H
Middle shelf: I, K, O
Bottom shelf: F, L, M
The books placed on the middle shelf are I, K, and L.
