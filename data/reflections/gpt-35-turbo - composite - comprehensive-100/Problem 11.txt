Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not carefully consider each option. 
The question asks for the most doubtful assertion, which means we need to find the statement that is least likely to be true.

Option [REDACTED] provides specific data on the increase in housing and land prices in Beijing, which makes it less likely to be false.
