Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is not a point of disagreement between the two passages. Passage [REDACTED] acknowledges that fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, but argues that it has been used for 100 years and has long been considered reliable. Passage [REDACTED], on the other hand, argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding the point of disagreement between the passages
- Misinterpreting the arguments presented in the passages
Solution:
Passage [REDACTED] argues that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. The trial court below was therefore within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage [REDACTED], on the other hand, argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. [REDACTED] more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification. The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Instructions:
1. Read the passages carefully and identify the main arguments presented in each.
2. Identify the points of disagreement between the passages.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are not points of disagreement between the passages.
4. Choose the answer choice that represents the point of disagreement between the passages.
Advice:
- Read the passages carefully and identify the main arguments presented in each.
- Look for points of agreement and disagreement between the passages.
- Eliminate answer choices that are not points of disagreement between the passages.
- Be careful not to misinterpret the arguments presented in the passages.
- Pay attention to the language used in the passages, as it may provide clues to the authors' opinions.
