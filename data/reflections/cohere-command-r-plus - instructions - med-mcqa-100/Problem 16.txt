Instructions:
1. Understand the physiological context: recognize that the question pertains to collateral circulation in the event of an obstruction.
2. Identify the relevant anatomical structures:
    - Second part of the axillary artery
    - Potential collateral pathways: deep branch of transverse cervical artery, subscapular artery, anterior circumflex humeral artery, posterior circumflex humeral artery, suprascapular artery.
3. Analyze the role of each structure:
    - Deep branch of transverse cervical artery and subscapular artery: these vessels provide anastomosis and collateral circulation to maintain blood flow.
    - Other circumflex humeral and scapular arteries: while important, they do not directly address the obstruction in the axillary artery.
4. Choose the answer that correctly identifies the collateral pathway: Answer "[REDACTED]".
