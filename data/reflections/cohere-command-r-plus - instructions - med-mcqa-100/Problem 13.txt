Instructions:
1. Understand the clinical context: Pyloric stenosis involves the narrowing of the pylorus, causing potential obstruction and vomiting. 
2. Recognize the role of imaging: Abdominal imaging is crucial for diagnosing pyloric stenosis and evaluating the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
3. Consider ultrasound's advantages: Ultrasound is a non-invasive, safe, and effective imaging modality that can provide detailed images of the pylorus and surrounding structures. 
4. Recall characteristic ultrasound findings: Pyloric stenosis often presents with specific ultrasound features, including pyloric muscle hypertrophy and a distended stomach. 
5. Choose the most appropriate imaging modality: Abdominal ultrasound ([REDA[REDACTED]ED]) is the initial investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis due to its sensitivity, safety profile, and ability to detect characteristic findings.
