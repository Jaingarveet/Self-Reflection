Instructions:
1. Understand the medical condition: Pyloric stenosis involves the narrowing of the pylorus.
2. Recall X-ray findings: Associate pyloric stenosis with the single bubble appearance on X-ray due to stomach distension.
3. Interpret the choices: 
    - [REDACTED] refers to the distended stomach bubble.
    - Double and triple bubble appearances indicate other gastrointestinal abnormalities but are not specific to pyloric stenosis.
    - Multiple air-fluid levels can suggest intestinal obstruction but are not specific enough.
4. Choose the answer: Select option [REDACTED] as the single bubble appearance is the characteristic X-ray finding of pyloric stenosis.
