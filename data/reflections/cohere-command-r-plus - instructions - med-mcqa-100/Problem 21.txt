Instructions:
1. Understand the question: Identify what type of RBCs are being referred to as "senescent."
2. Recognize the association: Know that certain *Plasmodium* species have a preference for specific RB[REDACTED] types. 
3. Specificity: Recall that *P. falciparum* primarily infects young RBCs, while *P. malariae*, causing quartan malaria, targets senescent RBCs due to its long persistence in the body. 
4. Answer selection: Choose "[REDACTED]" as the correct answer, as quartan malaria is associated with *P. malariae*, which has an affinity for senescent RBCs.
