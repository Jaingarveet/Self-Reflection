Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.

The passage states that quantum theory has been rigorously tested and its predictions have been accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error, despite scientists' reservations about its counterintuitive consequences. This means that quantum theory has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it, and it has withstood all of them. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.
