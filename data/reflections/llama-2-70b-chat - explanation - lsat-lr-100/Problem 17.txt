Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED], as it conforms to the principle that challenge can provide useful insights into one's weaknesses. The statement suggests that a concert pianist should not have a entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance, and that by understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances. This implies that the pianist is using the challenge of the difficult performance to gain insights into their own weaknesses and improve their performance.
