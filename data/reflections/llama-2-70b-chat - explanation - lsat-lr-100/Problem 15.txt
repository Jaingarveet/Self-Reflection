Explanation:
Morgenstern's argument is flawed because it fails to take into account the possibility that Brooks' unhappiness in his current job may be significantly greater than the unhappiness he would experience if he were to quit and not find another job. Morgenstern assumes that the unhappiness Brooks would experience in both situations is equal, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, Morgenstern's argument does not adequately address the complexity of Brooks' situation, and it fails to provide a convincing reason for why Brooks should quit his job.
