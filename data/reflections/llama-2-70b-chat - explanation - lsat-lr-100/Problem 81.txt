Explanation:
The statement suggests that prior experience in foreign affairs is not a requirement for a successful foreign policy, and that other qualities such as an acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and the ability to absorb and retain information are more important. Therefore, option [REDACTED], "Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy," must be true.
