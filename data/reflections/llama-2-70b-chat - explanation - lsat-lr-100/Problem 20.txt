Explanation:
The judge's reasoning is most supported by the principle that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. The defendant's confusion about whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building does not excuse his noncompliance with national building codes, as national codes take precedence over local codes. This means that even if the defendant was unsure about which codes applied, he was still required to comply with the national codes.

Choice [REDACTED] most closely aligns with this principle, as it states that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. This means that the defendant's noncompliance with national codes cannot be excused by his confusion about which codes applied. The other choices do not directly address the issue of precedence or the relationship between national and local codes, and thus do not support the judge's reasoning.
