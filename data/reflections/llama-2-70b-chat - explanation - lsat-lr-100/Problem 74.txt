Explanation:
The argument assumes that the chemical changes in the brain that occur as a result of talk therapy are the sole cause of the corresponding improvements in behavior. This assumption is necessary to support the idea that physicians will eventually be able to treat patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through talk therapy. If other factors, such as changes in the patient's thoughts or emotions, also play a role in the improvements, then the argument would not be valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The other choices are not assumptions on which the argument depends:

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the relationship between neurochemical changes and psychological changes in general.

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not suggest that talk therapy is ineffective.

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the relationship between psychology and neuroscience.

[REDACTED]: This statement is not an assumption of the argument, as the argument does not address the cost-effectiveness of different treatments.
