Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]. The argument states that using cotton fiber instead of nylon would reduce environmental damage. However, if cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products. This means that the overall environmental impact of nylon production would not be significantly reduced, as the decrease in nitrous oxide emissions from the production of thread and rope would be offset by the increase in nylon used in other products. This weakens the argument that using cotton fiber instead of nylon would significantly reduce environmental damage.
