Explanation:
The argument in choice [REDACTED] most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above. Both arguments rely on a faulty "if-then" statement, where the conclusion is based on an unproven or false premise.

In the argument above, the conclusion is that the party's economic theories were flawed because the inflation rate increased despite their implementation. This is based on the assumption that if the party's economic theories were sound, the inflation rate would have decreased.

In choice [REDACTED], the conclusion is that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries because its stock price did not increase despite the expected outcome of such a sale. This is based on the assumption that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries, its stock price would have increased.

Both arguments rely on an unproven or false premise, and therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.
