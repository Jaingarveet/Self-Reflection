Explanation:
The argumentative technique employed in the passage is conditional advocacy. The author is suggesting that those who wish to make an accusation of being unyielding should choose that term because it is difficult to deny that a person who has not yielded is unyielding. The author is not rejecting a factic, but rather suggesting a strategic approach to making an accusation. Therefore, options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] do not accurately describe the argumentative technique employed. Option [REDACTED] is also not accurate, as the author is not advocating for a less offensive accusation but rather a more effective one.
