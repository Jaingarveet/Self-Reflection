I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider the possibility that the lower accident rate on heavily trafficked highways could be due to the fact that vehicles are moving at a lower rate of speed. I was influenced by the fact that the question mentioned that heavily trafficked highways tend to have better maintenance, lighting, and safety features, which led me to choose option [REDACTED].
