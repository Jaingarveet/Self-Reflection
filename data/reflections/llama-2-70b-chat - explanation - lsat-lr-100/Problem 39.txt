Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the nature of Rossi's argument. I thought that Rossi's argument was based on the predictable consequences of a proposal, specifically the impact of governmental deficits on future generations. However, Rossi's argument actually appeals to a general principle of democracy, that people should have the right to vote and have their interests represented in government.
