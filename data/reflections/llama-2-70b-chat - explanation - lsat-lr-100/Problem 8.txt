Explanation:
The argument assumes that the correlation between high-fther diets and low colon cancer rates is causal, with fther consumption being the sole factor responsible for the difference. However, this overlooks the possibility that other substances in foods containing fther may also play a role in preventing colon cancer. Choice [REDACTED] acknowledges this by stating that foods containing fther also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer. Therefore, it is not just the fther itself that is responsible for the reduced cancer risk, but also other components of fther-rich foods. This weakens the argument's conclusion that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer.
