Explanation:
The lawyer's argument is that jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language because it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified.

If the details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language, then the lawyer's argument would be weakened. This is because the lawyer is arguing that simple language is sufficient for the jurors to have an adequate understanding of their role, but if the details cannot be specified precisely in simple language, then the lawyer's argument loses force.

Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
