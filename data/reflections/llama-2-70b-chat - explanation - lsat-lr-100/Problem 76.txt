Explanation:
The argument presented in the question states that while a diet based on fish protein is healthier, adopting it universally would lead to the extinction of marine species, making it impossible. Similarly, choice [REDACTED] states that while it's better for a consumer to limit purchases to necessities and save or invest the rest, adopting this pattern universally would cause a recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people. Both arguments acknowledge a benefit in a particular behavior or policy but recognize that universal adoption would have negative consequences, making it unfeasible. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] most closely resembles the reasoning in the argument.
