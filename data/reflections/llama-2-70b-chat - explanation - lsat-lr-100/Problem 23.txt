Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the role of the assertion in the teacher's argument.
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
The teacher mentions that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination as one possible benefit of funding children's athletic programs. However, the teacher does not rely solely on this reason to support the policy. Instead, the teacher offers an additional reason, citing research that shows adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties. Therefore, the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting the policy, but it is not the primary reason for the teacher's position.
