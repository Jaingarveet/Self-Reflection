Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the study's findings. 
I thought the study showed that the body regulates the amount of nicotine it absorbs, but the correct answer suggests that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
