Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The argument suggests that it is difficult or impossible to learn the lessons of history, and that even if we could discover what the lessons are, it is not clear that we could apply them to future situations. The argument is directed toward discrediting the idea that we can learn useful lessons from history, and therefore, the assumption that we should learn the lessons of history is not required to establish the argument's conclusion.
