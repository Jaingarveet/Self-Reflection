Explanation:
The example presented above most closely conforms to proposition [REDACTED]: "The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to imbue it with order and coherence." The person in the game assumes that the group's answers are related to a dream, and they try to construct a coherent narrative based on the yes-or-no answers they receive. Even though there is no actual dream, the person's presumption that there is a coherent narrative leads them to create one based on the arbitrary answers given by the group. This illustrates how our tendency to look for order and meaning can sometimes lead us to create coherent narratives where none exist.
