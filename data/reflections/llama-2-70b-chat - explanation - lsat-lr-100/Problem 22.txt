Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.

This answer choice weakens the argument that Grey read Jordan's book because it suggests that the metaphor was not unique to Jordan's book and that both authors may have obtained it from the same source. This shared source could be the text published in 1860, which both Jordan and Grey may have read. Therefore, the fact that Grey uses the same metaphor as Jordan does not necessarily mean that he read her book.
