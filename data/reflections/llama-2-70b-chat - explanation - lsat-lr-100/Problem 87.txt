Explanation:
The argument concludes that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. However, choice [REDACTED] states that the members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group. This information directly contradicts the conclusion and suggests that attending support group meetings may indeed have a positive effect on the lifespan of patients with disease T. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] most seriously weakens the argument.
