Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The explanation for why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged despite the discovery of 40 billion more galaxies is that the mass of galaxies is only a small fraction of the universe's total mass. This means that even though the number of galaxies has increased, their total mass is still a small percentage of the universe's total mass, and therefore, the estimates of the universe's total mass remain largely unchanged.
