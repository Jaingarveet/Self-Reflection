Explanation:
The medical researcher's argument is based on the assumption that stretching before jogging has no effect on the prevention of injuries. However, choice [REDACTED] states that the more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. This implies that the group of joggers who do not stretch before jogging may be more prone to injuries, which could explain why both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] weakens the medical researcher's argument by suggesting that the groups compared may not have been comparable in terms of their propensity for injuries.
