Explanation:
Mike's reasoning is based on the principle of reciprocity, which states that if someone has used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission. This principle is reflected in choice [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" However, this is not the best answer.

The best answer is choice [REDACTED]: "It is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others." This principle suggests that if Tom has used Mary's bicycle without her permission, it is permissible for Mike to use Tom's computer without his permission. This principle is more general than choice [REDACTED], which is limited to cases where people have used your property without your permission. Choice [REDACTED] applies to all cases where people have treated others in a certain way, and it provides a broader justification for Mike's reasoning.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].

Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the principle that Mike was using to justify his actions. I thought that Mike was relying on the principle of reciprocity, which is reflected in choice [REDACTED]. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Mike was actually relying on the principle of treating people in a way that is similar to how they have treated others, which is reflected in choice [REDACTED]. This principle is a broader principle that applies to all cases where people have treated others in a certain way, and it provides a stronger justification for Mike's actions.

In the future, I will make sure to carefully consider all of the available choices and to choose the one that most accurately reflects the principle that the person is relying on. I will also make sure to consider broader principles that may apply to the situation, rather than limiting myself to a narrow interpretation of the facts.
