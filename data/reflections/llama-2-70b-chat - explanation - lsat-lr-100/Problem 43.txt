Explanation:
The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if choice [REDACTED] is assumed. The ethicist argues that if "love" in marital vows refers to a feeling, then the promise to love "until death do us part" makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control. This argument assumes that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.
