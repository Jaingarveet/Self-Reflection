Explanation:
The local resident's argument assumes that the overabundance of algae is the cause of the deaths of smaller fish, but it ignores the possibility that both the overabundance of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are independent effects of a common cause, such as changes in water temperature, pollution, or other environmental factors. This failure to consider alternative explanations for the observed correlation weakens the argument and makes it vulnerable to criticism. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
