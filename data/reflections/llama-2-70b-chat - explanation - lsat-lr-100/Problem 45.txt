Explanation:
The art critic argues that Nan Paulsen's reviews of automobiles should not have received the Woerner Journalism Award for criticism because cars are utilitarian objects, not works of art, and therefore, they do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This argument is supported by choice [REDACTED], which states that reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. This principle suggests that criticism should focus on objects that have cultural significance and reveal important truths about society, rather than utilitarian objects like cars. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] most helps to justify the reasoning in the art critic's argument.
