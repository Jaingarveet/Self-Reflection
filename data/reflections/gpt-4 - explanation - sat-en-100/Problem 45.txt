Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information given in the passage. The passage mentioned that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that if crops were planted, they might compete with the weeds, potentially reducing the percentage of the surface covered with weeds. I overlooked this implication and instead chose an answer that suggested uncertainty.
