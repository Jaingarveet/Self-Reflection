Explanation:
I misinterpreted the data in the table. I assumed that because all four pathogens were present in colonies with colony collapse disorder, this meant that all colonies were infected by all four pathogens. However, the table actually shows the percentage of colonies affected by each individual pathogen, not all four together.
