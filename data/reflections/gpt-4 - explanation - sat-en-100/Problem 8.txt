Explanation:
I misread the table and incorrectly identified the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. I chose IAPV, which had a high percentage, but not the highest. The correct answer is [REDACTED], which infected all colonies without colony collapse disorder.
