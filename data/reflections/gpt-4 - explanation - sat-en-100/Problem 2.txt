Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the authors' views in Passage 1. I assumed that the authors were comparing the skills needed to run a household and raise children to those needed to run a country or a business, which led me to choose option [REDACTED]. However, the authors did not make such a comparison in the passage.
