Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the units of the variables involved.
 - Make sure to distinguish between initial values and rates of change.
 - Double-check the units of the slope and y-intercept to ensure they are consistent with the units of the variables.
 - Remember that the slope-intercept form of a linear equation is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
