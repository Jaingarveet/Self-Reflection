Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning at the final step. I had correctly set up the equations and solved for x, finding that x = 10/9. However, I then incorrectly interpreted this result. The question asked for the number of pita breads equivalent to [REDACTED] baguettes, but I compared 10/9 to the fractions in the answer choices, looking for the closest value. Instead, I should have multiplied 10/9 by [REDACTED] to find the number of pita breads equivalent to [REDACTED] baguettes.
