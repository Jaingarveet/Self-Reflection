Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I correctly identified that the total number of students must be a multiple of 25 for both the percentage of physics students and math students to be whole numbers. However, I failed to consider the additional constraint that the sum of the percentages of physics and math students should not exceed 100%. If 48% of the students took either physics or math, then the remaining 52% must have taken neither, which is not possible if every student must take at least one of these subjects.
