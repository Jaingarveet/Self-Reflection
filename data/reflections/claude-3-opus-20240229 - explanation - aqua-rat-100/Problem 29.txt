Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the number of days it would take the frog to escape the well. I correctly calculated that the frog effectively gains 1m per day, but I incorrectly concluded that the frog would reach the top on the 29th day. In reality, the frog needs an extra day to fully escape the well after reaching the 29m mark.
