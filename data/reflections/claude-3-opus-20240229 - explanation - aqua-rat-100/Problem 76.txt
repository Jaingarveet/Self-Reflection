Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the upper bound for x. When I substituted n=72 into the expression, I miscalculated 4*âˆš72, which should be approximately 33.9, not 34. This small error propagated through my calculation, leading me to incorrectly conclude that the upper bound for x was 63.64, when in fact it should have been slightly lower.
