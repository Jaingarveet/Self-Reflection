Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the total number of matches played. I assumed that the 20 matches won represented [REDACTED]% of the total matches, but this was not stated in the problem. Instead, I should have used the fact that [REDACTED]% of the total matches were lost to calculate the number of matches lost directly.
