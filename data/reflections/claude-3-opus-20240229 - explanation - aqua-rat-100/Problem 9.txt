Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the number of bags sold. I divided the total profit by the profit per bag, but this is incorrect because the profit per bag was calculated as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost price. To find the number of bags sold, I should have divided the total profit by the profit per bag in dollars, not as a percentage.
