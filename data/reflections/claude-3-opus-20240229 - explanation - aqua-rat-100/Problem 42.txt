Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation. I correctly identified that each picket plus space is 13/2 inches wide, and that the total width in inches is [REDACTED]. However, I failed to account for the fact that there is one less space than there are pickets. With x pickets, there are only x-1 spaces. So the correct total width in inches is [REDACTED] - 6, not [REDACTED]. When converting to feet, this becomes ([REDACTED] - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24 feet.
