Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the length of the space shuttle. I correctly calculated the speed of the shuttle, but I did not properly consider what it means for the shuttle to "pass a point" in the context of the problem. I assumed that the shuttle would travel its own length in the time it takes to pass a point, but this is incorrect.
