Explanation:
I made an error in my combinatorial reasoning when determining the number of unique codes that can be created with a given number of letters. I incorrectly assumed that using [REDACTED] letters would be sufficient to create [REDACTED] unique codes, but I failed to account for the fact that the order of letters in a pair does not matter.
