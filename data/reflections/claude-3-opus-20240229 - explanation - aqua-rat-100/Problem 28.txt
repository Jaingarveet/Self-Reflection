Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the probability that neither event will occur. I correctly identified the events and the given probabilities, but I mistakenly assumed that the events were independent when this was not stated in the problem. Without knowing if the events are independent, I should have considered the possibility that they are dependent, which would lead to a different calculation and a different answer.
