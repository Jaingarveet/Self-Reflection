Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about how to account for the repeated letter 'C' in the word "PROBLE[REDACTED]". I incorrectly thought that I needed to divide the total number of permutations by [REDACTED] to account for the repeated letter. However, the correct approach is to directly calculate the number of permutations of 7 distinct objects, which is simply [REDACTED].
