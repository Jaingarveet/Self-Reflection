Explanation:
I correctly calculated the amounts of zinc and copper in alloys X and Y, and the total amounts of zinc and copper in the resulting alloy Z. However, I made an error in simplifying the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. I incorrectly simplified 39.33 : 60.67 to 59 : 91, but the correct simplification is 59 : 91.
