Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I correctly identified that n must be an odd perfect square for n/2 to be a perfect square. However, I then tried to find a value of n that would make all 5 numbers two-digit numbers, which was not necessary. The question only asks which of the given numbers could be one of the 5 numbers, not all of them.
