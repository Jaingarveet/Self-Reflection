Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the remaining area of the paper. I correctly calculated the area of the square and the area of the two semicircles that were cut out. However, when subtracting the area of the semicircles from the area of the square, I forgot to convert the result from square centimeters to square meters. This led me to choose an incorrect answer that was off by a factor of 100.
