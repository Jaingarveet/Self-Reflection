Solution:
The slope of the first equation is [REDACTED].
The slope of the second equation is -a/2.
For the system to have no solution, the slopes must be equal, and the y-intercepts must be different.
The y-intercept of the first equation is [REDACTED], and the y-intercept of the second equation is 4.
Since the y-intercepts are different, we only need to equate the slopes.
[REDACTED] = -a/2
Solving for a, we get a = [REDACTED].
However, this would result in the same line, which means there are infinite solutions, not no solution.
For the system to have no solution, the slopes must be equal, but the lines must not be the same.
This occurs when the y-intercepts are different, and the slopes are equal.
To find the value of a that results in no solution, we can set the slopes equal and solve for a, but we must also ensure that the lines are not the same.
[REDACTED] = -a/2
a = [REDACTED]
Since the y-intercepts are different, we need to find a value of a that results in a different line.
If we set a = [REDACTED], the second equation becomes [REDACTED]x + 2y = 4, which has a different slope and y-intercept from the first equation.
