Solution:
The initial payment of $60 is subtracted from the total price of $300, leaving $240 to be paid in weekly installments of $30.
The equation to find the number of weekly payments, w, is $240 = 30w.
However, this is not one of the available choices.
The correct equation is $300 = 30w + 60, which can be rearranged to $240 = 30w.
