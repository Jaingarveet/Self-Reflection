Solution:
Let's denote the number of students in the class as x.
When Mr. Kohl gives each student 3 milliliters of solution, he has 5 milliliters left over. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 3x + 5.
When Mr. Kohl gives each student 4 milliliters of solution, he needs an additional [REDACTED] milliliters. This means that the total amount of solution distributed is 4x + [REDACTED].
Since the total amount of solution distributed is the same in both cases, we can set up the following equation:
3x + 5 = 4x - [REDACTED]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
3x + 5 + [REDACTED] = 4x - [REDACTED] + [REDACTED]
3x + [REDACTED] = 4x
Subtracting 3x from both sides, we get:
[REDACTED] = x
