Solution:
1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
2. If both G and H are selected (two botanists), then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
3. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
5. If both G and H are selected, M cannot be selected as the chemist because that would require selecting both P and R, violating the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected.
6. Therefore, if both G and H are selected, the chemist must be either F or K.
