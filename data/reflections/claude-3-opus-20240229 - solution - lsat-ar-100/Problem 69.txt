Solution:
1. The question states that P is performed third and S is performed sixth. 
2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since P is third, O must be first.
3. This leaves the second, fourth, fifth, and seventh positions open.
4. T must be either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
5. At least two compositions are between F and R in either order.
6. The eighth composition is either L or H.
7. The fifth composition must be either [REDACTED], since:
   - O is first, not fifth
   - R must have F and two other compositions on one side, and T on the other side
   - If F is fifth, T and two other compositions are performed after it
   - If T is fifth, F and two other compositions are performed before it
8. Therefore, if P is third and S is sixth, the fifth composition must be either [REDACTED].
