Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, this time being careful to correctly interpret the problem conditions:
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Here, Nina gives a report on Wednesday morning, but Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday. 
[REDACTED]: Satisfies all conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert give morning reports. If Nina had given a report, it would have had to be on Monday or Tuesday for Helen and Irving to both report the next day, but Nina is not reporting at all in this schedule.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
[REDACTED]: Violates the conditions that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
Therefore, the only schedule that satisfies all the conditions is choice [REDACTED].
