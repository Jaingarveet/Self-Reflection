Solution:
1. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 
2. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
3. Therefore, the first and third batches of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
4. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
5. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
6. Exactly one batch is made on Friday.
7. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday (A), this satisfies all conditions. No other choice does.
8. Therefore, (A) is the only choice that could be true.
