Solution:
1. There are only three plays in total: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation.
2. Megregian reviews at least 2 plays, as Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
3. Jiang cannot review any of the plays Megregian reviews.
4. Since there are only 3 plays total and Megregian reviews at least 2 of them, Jiang can review at most 1 play.
5. Therefore, Megregian necessarily reviews more plays than Jiang.
