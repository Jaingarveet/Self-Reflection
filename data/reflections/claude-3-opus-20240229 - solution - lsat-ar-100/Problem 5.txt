Solution:
Given:
 - There are 8 books (F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O) and 3 shelves (top, middle, bottom)
 - At least 2 books are on each shelf
 - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
 - I is on the middle shelf
 - K is on a higher shelf than F
 - O is on a higher shelf than L
 - F is on the same shelf as M
Step 1: I is on the middle shelf.
Step 2: The bottom shelf has at least 3 books, the middle shelf at least 2, and the top shelf exactly 2.
Step 3: F and M are together on either the middle or bottom shelf.
Step 4: K is on either the top or middle shelf, above F and M.
Step 5: O is above L. L cannot be on the top shelf, so it must be on the middle or bottom.
Step 6: Since L is below O, and F and M are together below K, the only consistent arrangement is:
        - Top: K, O
        - Middle: I and 1 other book
        - Bottom: F, M, L and at least 1 other book
Therefore, O must be on a higher shelf than M.
