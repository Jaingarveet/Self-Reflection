Solution:
Given:
 - There are 7 articles: G, H, J (finance), Q, R, S (nutrition), Y (wildlife)
 - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic
 - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third
 - S must be earlier than Y
 - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R
If J is third:
1. G and H must be after J (4th or later)
2. The first two articles must be from Q, R, S, or Y to avoid consecutive same-topic articles
3. S cannot be 1st or 2nd because it must be before Y
4. Q cannot be 1st because if J is 3rd, Q can only be 3rd if it's after S
5. So the first two must be R and Y in some order
6. With J 3rd, G must be 4th and R 5th to satisfy ordering constraints
7. This leaves H and Y for 6th and 7th, and since S must be before Y, Y must be 7th
Therefore, if J is 3rd, Y must be 7th, so Y could be 5th is true.
