Solution:
Let's carefully consider each choice:
A) [REDACTED] This can be true. If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned (to Venezuela or Yemen).
B) [REDACTED] This can be true. If Kayne is assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo can be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen.
C) [REDACTED] This CANNOT be true. If Novetzke is assigned, Kayne cannot be assigned due to the first constraint.
D) [REDACTED] This can be true. The constraints don't require Landon to be assigned.
E) [REDACTED] This can be true. The constraints don't require Ong to be assigned.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. Novetzke CANNOT be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
