Solution:
1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
2. Exactly two students review the same play(s). Given (1), these two must be Kramer and O'Neill, and they only review Tamerlane.
3. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian must review at least two plays.
4. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
5. If exactly three students review Undulation, and Kramer and O'Neill only review Tamerlane, then the third student reviewing Undulation must be either Jiang or Megregian, but not both (from 4).
6. If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian cannot (from 4). But Megregian must review at least two plays (from 3). So if Jiang reviews Undulation, Megregian must review both Sunset and Tamerlane. 
7. If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Jiang cannot (from 4). So Jiang must review Sunset. Lopez can then review either Sunset or Tamerlane or both.
8. Looking at the answer choices, only [REDACTED] (O'Neill reviews Sunset) is definitely false based on the given conditions. All others could be true in some scenario.
