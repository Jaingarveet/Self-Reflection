2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
4. None of the clients has a website target of 2 days.
5. If no website target is 2 days, and Image's website target is 1 day (the shortest possible to be less than its voicemail target), then Solide and Truvest must have website targets of 3 days.
6. Image's voicemail target is 1 day (condition 2), Solide's voicemail target could be 2 days, and Truvest's 3 days. This satisfies all conditions and makes choice [REDACTED] possible.
