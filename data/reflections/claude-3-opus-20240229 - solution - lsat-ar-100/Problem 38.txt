Solution:
Given:
- 8 books total: F, G, [REDACTED], K, L, M, O
- 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
- At least 2 books per shelf
- More books on bottom than top
- I on middle shelf
- K on higher shelf than F
- O on higher shelf than L
- F on same shelf as M
- G on top shelf
If G is on the top shelf:
1. I must be on the middle shelf.
2. K must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as K is higher than F).
3. L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (as O is higher than L).
4. F and M must be together on the middle or bottom shelf.
5. O must be on the middle or top shelf (as O is higher than L).
Looking at the answer choices with this information:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible (at least 2 books per shelf)
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED], L - Possible 
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible (K and L can be on middle with I, F and M can be on bottom with H and O, G on top)
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible (F and M must be on the same shelf, which can't be the middle as I is there)
Therefore, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] could be a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf, with [REDACTED] being the correct answer that I previously eliminated.
