Solution:
1. Image's website target is given as 2 days.
2. We know that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. 
3. Therefore, [REDACTED] must be either 2 days or 1 day to satisfy this condition.
4. We are also told that [REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. 
5. The only way to satisfy both conditions is for [REDACTED] to also be 2 days. If it were 1 day, it would violate the first condition.
6. Thus, [REDACTED] must be 2 days.
