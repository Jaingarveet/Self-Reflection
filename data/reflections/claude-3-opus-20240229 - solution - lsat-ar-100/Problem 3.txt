Solution:
Given:
 - Robertson is assigned parking space #3
 - Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson
 - Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young
Therefore:
 - Young must be assigned parking space #2 (the only space lower than Robertson's #3)
 - Togowa must be assigned parking space #1 (the only space lower than Young's #2)
So the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
