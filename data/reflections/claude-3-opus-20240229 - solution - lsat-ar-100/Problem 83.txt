Solution:
Given:
1. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.
2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
5. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's.
If Julio leads Wednesday morning and Kevin leads Thursday or Friday morning, then:
 - Rebecca must lead the afternoon session on the same day as Kevin (Thursday or Friday).
 - Olivia must lead on a later day than Julio (Thursday or Friday).
 - Lan must lead on a different day than Olivia.
 - The only day left for Lan is Wednesday, and it must be the afternoon session since Julio has the morning.
 - Nessa will lead the remaining afternoon session (Thursday or Friday).
Therefore, Lan cannot lead the Wednesday morning session, so choice [REDACTED] is the exception - it cannot be true.
