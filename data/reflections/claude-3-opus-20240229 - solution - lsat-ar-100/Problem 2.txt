Solution:
1. The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least two spaces between the restaurants.
2. With seven spaces in total, this constraint allows for the following possible locations of the restaurants:
   - Spaces 1 and 4 (or 4 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 5 (or 3 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 6 (or 2 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 7
3. Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:
   [REDACTED]: This would restrict a restaurant to the middle three spaces, which is not equivalent to the original constraint.
   
   [REDACTED]: This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.
   
   [REDACTED]: This is not equivalent to the original constraint. If either the toy store or the veterinarian is between the restaurants, it does not guarantee that there are at least two businesses separating the restaurants.
   
   [REDACTED]: This is equivalent to the original constraint. If no more than two businesses separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it, then the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.
   
   [REDACTED]: This is unrelated to the separation of the restaurants.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. Substituting the original constraint with "No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it" would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses.
