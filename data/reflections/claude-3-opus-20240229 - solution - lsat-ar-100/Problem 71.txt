Solution:
Let's reconsider the problem step-by-step:
1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Now, let's examine each answer choice:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is possible. If Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1, Tiao is in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall are also in Zone 2, then Kim and Mahr would be the only ones left for Zone 3, satisfying the condition that Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is not possible. If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Udall must be in Zone 2 (because they can't be together). But then Stuckey would also be in Zone 2 (because Stuckey and Udall are always together), leaving no one for Zone 1.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is not possible. If Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, then either Tiao or Udall must be in Zone 1, and the other must be in Zone 2. But then Stuckey would also be in Zone 2 (because Stuckey and Udall are always together), meaning Zone 2 would have 2 representatives, equal to Zone 3, which violates the condition.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is not possible. Tiao and Udall cannot be in the same zone.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED], Stuckey, Udall - This is not possible. If Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall are also in Zone 3, then no one is left for Zone 1, which violates the condition.
Therefore, [REDACTED] is the only choice that could be a complete and accurate list for Zone 3.
