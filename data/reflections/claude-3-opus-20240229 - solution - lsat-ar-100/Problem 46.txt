Solution:
1. Reynaldo cannot test F on either day.
2. Yuki cannot test J on either day.
3. Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
4. The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
5. If Theresa tests H on the first day, then one of Reynaldo, Seamus, or Yuki must test H on the second day (to satisfy the condition that all bicycles are tested each day).
6. If Theresa tests H on the second day, then she cannot test F on the second day.
7. Therefore, regardless of which day Theresa tests H, she cannot test F on the second day.
