Solution:
Let's re-evaluate each choice considering all the requirements:
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. Not a valid selection.
[REDACTED]: Violates the same condition as [REDACTED]. Not a valid selection.
[REDACTED]: Has 6 works total, 4 French works (2 novels + 2 plays), 4 novels (2 French + 2 Russian), and equal numbers of French and Russian novels. Satisfies all requirements. This is a valid selection.
[REDACTED]: Has 5 French works, violating the requirement of no more than 4 French works. Not a valid selection.
[REDACTED]: Has 5 novels, violating the requirement of no more than 4 novels. Not a valid selection.
Therefore, only choice [REDACTED] could be the organizer's selection of works.
