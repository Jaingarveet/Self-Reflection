Solution:
Given:
- There are 7 articles: G, H, J (finance), Q, R, S (nutrition), Y (wildlife)
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic
- S can be earlier than Q only if [REDACTED]
- S must be earlier than Y
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R
- Y is fourth
If Y is fourth, then:
1. Articles in positions 3 and 5 cannot be about wildlife (given)
2. S must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (given)
3. If S is in position 3, then Q must be in position 1 or 2 (given)
4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R (given)
Considering the possibilities:
- If S is in position 1, then H must be in position 2 (to avoid consecutive nutrition articles). Then J must be in position 3 (to avoid consecutive finance articles and to be before G). This satisfies all conditions.
- If S is in position 2, then Q must be in position 1 (to avoid S being earlier than Q when Q is not third). Then J must be in position 3 (same reason as above). This also satisfies all conditions.
- If S is in position 3, then Q must be in position 1 or 2. But this would mean that either G or H must be in position 5, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
Therefore, J must be in position 3, which means that [REDACTED]
