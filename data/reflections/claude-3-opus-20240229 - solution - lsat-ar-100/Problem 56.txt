Solution:
1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
2. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
4. The question states that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
5. The only way for more representatives to be in Zone 1 than Zone 3, while still having more in Zone 3 than Zone 2, is if Zone 1 has 2 representatives, Zone 3 has 1, and Zone 2 has 0.
6. For this to happen, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1 (since they must be together), Tiao must also be in Zone 1 (since either Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1), and Udall must be in Zone 3 (since Stuckey and Udall must be together).
7. This leaves Stuckey in Zone 3, and Kim and Mahr to be distributed among the zones.
8. The only answer choice that could be true in this scenario is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
