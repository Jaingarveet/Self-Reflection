Solution:
The problem states that J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be either the 6th or 7th house shown.
It also states that K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in either the afternoon (3rd, 4th, or 5th) or evening (6th or 7th).
Since J is always in the evening and K is never in the morning, there is no way for J and K to be shown consecutively. If K is shown in the afternoon, it will not be next to J. If K is shown in the evening, it can only be 6th if J is 7th, or 7th if J is 6th.
Therefore, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order, making [REDACTED] the correct answer.
