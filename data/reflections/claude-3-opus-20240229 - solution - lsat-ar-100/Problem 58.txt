Solution:
1. The bays are numbered 1 through 6.
2. The order of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], from lowest to highest bay, is: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. 
3. Produce is next to [REDACTED] and has a higher number than fuel.
4. The only possible arrangements for [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are:
   - Textiles in bay 1, [REDACTED] in bay 2
   - Textiles in bay 2, [REDACTED] in bay 1
   - Textiles in bay 2, [REDACTED] in bay 3
   - Textiles in bay 3, [REDACTED] in bay 2
5. In all cases, [REDACTED] must have a higher number than [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] a higher number than [REDACTED].
6. This means [REDACTED] must be in bay 3 or 4, and [REDACTED] must be in bay 5 or 6.
7. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be in bay 4, so [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
