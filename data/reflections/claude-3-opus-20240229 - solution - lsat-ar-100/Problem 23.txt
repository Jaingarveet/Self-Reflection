Solution:
Given:
- Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday.
- Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday.
- George must give a report on Tuesday (the only day he can).
- Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
1. Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, George must give the morning report on Tuesday.
2. Since Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, the morning report on Wednesday must be given by Irving (because if Nina had given a report on Tuesday, both Helen and Irving would need to give reports on Wednesday).
3. The morning report on Monday must be given by Robert, as he cannot give an afternoon report, and the other morning slots are filled.
Therefore, the correct order of morning reports is: Robert (Monday), George (Tuesday), Irving (Wednesday), which matches choice [REDACTED].
