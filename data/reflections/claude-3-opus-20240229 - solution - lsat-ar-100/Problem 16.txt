Solution:
1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. This eliminates choice [REDACTED]. 
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This is satisfied by choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
   - In choice [REDACTED], Julio leads on Thursday and Olivia on Friday, satisfying the constraint. 
   - In choice [REDACTED], Julio leads on Thursday and Olivia on Friday, also satisfying the constraint.
   - In choice [REDACTED], Julio leads on Wednesday and Olivia on Friday, satisfying the constraint.
5. Since choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] were eliminated in step 1, the only remaining choice that satisfies all constraints is [REDACTED].
