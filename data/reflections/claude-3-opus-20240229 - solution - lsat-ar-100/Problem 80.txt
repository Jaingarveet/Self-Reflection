Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, carefully applying all the rules:
Choice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 3 as Young (#1) is assigned a lower-numbered space than Robertson (#4).
Choice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 1 as Togowa (#2) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3). 
Choice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 2 as Souza (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Xu (#3).
Choice [REDACTED]: Violates rule 3. Since Robertson must be higher than Young, and Young must be higher than Togowa, Robertson must also be higher than Togowa. But here Robertson (#2) is lower than Togowa (#1).
Choice [REDACTED]: Satisfies all the rules:
- Young (#3) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Togowa (#2). 
- Xu (#5) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza (#1).
- Robertson (#4) is assigned a higher-numbered space than Young (#3).
- Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is allowed.
Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED].
