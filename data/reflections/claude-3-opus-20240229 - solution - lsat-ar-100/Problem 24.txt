Solution:
The original constraint states: "If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne." 
This means that Jaramillo cannot be assigned unless Kayne is also assigned. However, it does not preclude Kayne from being assigned without Jaramillo.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) "If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo" is the contrapositive, but it changes the meaning. It would force Jaramillo to be assigned whenever Kayne is, which is not the same as the original constraint.
B) "If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke" is irrelevant to the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne.
C) "If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship" is also irrelevant to the original constraint.
D) "Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships" captures the essence of the original constraint. If Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be assigned because Kayne must be. This has the same effect as the original.
E) "Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships" is once again irrelevant to the original constraint.
Therefore, [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
