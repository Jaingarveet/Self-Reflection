Solution:
1. The panel includes F (botanist), L (chemist), Q (zoologist), and R (zoologist).
2. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type, which is satisfied.
3. F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected, which is satisfied as [REDACTED] is not selected.
4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected, which is satisfied as neither is selected.
5. If [REDACTED] is selected, both [REDACTED] and R must be selected. [REDACTED] is not selected, so this condition does not apply.
6. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Only one botanist (F) is selected, so this condition allows for the selection of another zoologist.
7. The fifth scientist must be a zoologist, and the only remaining zoologist is [REDACTED].
