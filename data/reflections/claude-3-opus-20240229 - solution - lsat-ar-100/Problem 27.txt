Solution:
1. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must be included in the list.
2. Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. 
3. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
4. Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian. If Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, then Megregian would also have to review it to satisfy the condition that Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez. However, the correct answer includes Megregian but not Lopez, so Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.
5. Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill.
