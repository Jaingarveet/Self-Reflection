Solution:
1. Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions on the same day.
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she must lead either a Thursday or Friday session.
3. If Lan leads a Thursday or Friday session, then [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday session (because they can't be on the same day).
4. [REDACTED]'s session must be earlier in the week than [REDACTED]'s. Since [REDACTED] is on Wednesday, [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday morning session.
5. [REDACTED] must lead an afternoon session. The only remaining afternoon session is on Friday.
6. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions on the same day, which must be Thursday since Wednesday and Friday are fully booked.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session.
