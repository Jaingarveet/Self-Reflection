Solution:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned an ambassadorship. 
2. If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned an ambassadorship.
3. If Jaramillo is assigned an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne. 
4. Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Jaramillo must also be assigned an ambassadorship.
5. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. 
6. Since Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela.
7. The only remaining country for Ong is Zambia.
8. If Landon is assigned an ambassadorship, it must be to Zambia. 
9. But since Ong is assigned to Zambia, Landon cannot be assigned an ambassadorship.
10. Therefore, if Kayne is assigned to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned to Venezuela.
