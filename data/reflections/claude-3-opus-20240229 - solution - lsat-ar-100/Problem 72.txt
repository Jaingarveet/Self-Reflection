Solution:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end and a restaurant at the other end.
2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
3. So we have this arrangement so far: 
   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means the second restaurant could be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
6. Given these constraints, there are two possible arrangements:
   a) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Restaurant
   b) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Restaurant - Veterinarian - Restaurant
7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are [REDACTED].
