Solution:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can't be featured on any other day, including day 7.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7. So they must be featured on three of days 2-6.
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. 
4. No breed can be featured on two consecutive days.
5. If Himalayans are on days 2, 4, 6, then Rottweilers must be on days 3, 5. Manx/Siamese on 1, 7.
6. If Himalayans are on days 3, 5, then Rottweilers can only be on day 4. Manx/Siamese on 1, 2, 6, 7.
7. In both cases, days 2 and 6 must feature different breeds, either Himalayan/Newfoundland or Manx/Siamese and Newfoundland.
8. All other pairs of days in the choices could potentially feature the same breeds in some arrangement.
Therefore, days 2 and 6 CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and puppy.
