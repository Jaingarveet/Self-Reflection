Solution:
Let's re-examine each choice carefully, ensuring all constraints are satisfied:
[REDACTED]. No Russian novels and exactly one play: This is not possible. If no Russian novels are selected, then all 3 French novels must be selected to have at least 3 novels. But then selecting 1 play would require selecting 4 French works, violating the limit of no more than 4 French works.
[REDACTED]. Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays: This is possible. We can select 1 Russian novel, 2 French novels, and both French plays, satisfying all constraints.
[REDACTED]. Exactly two French novels and the Russian play: This is possible, as previously determined.
[REDACTED]. Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays: This is possible, as previously determined. 
[REDACTED]. Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play: This is possible, as previously determined.
Therefore, the only choice that cannot be true is [REDACTED].
