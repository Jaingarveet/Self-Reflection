Solution:
1. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, leaving George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
2. George can only report on Tuesday, so he must present on Tuesday morning or afternoon.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must present in the morning if they report.
4. If Nina reports, then the next day Helen and Irving must both report, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
5. The only way to satisfy all conditions is:
   - Monday morning: Olivia
   - Monday afternoon: Nina
   - Tuesday morning: Robert
   - Tuesday afternoon: George
   - Wednesday morning: Irving 
   - Wednesday afternoon: Helen
6. Therefore, the correct morning sequence is Olivia, Robert, Irving.
