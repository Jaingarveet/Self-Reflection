Solution:
Given:
 - Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports.
 - George can only report on Tuesday.
 - Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
 - If Nina reports, then Helen and Irving must report the next day, unless Nina reports on Wednesday.
Step 1: Since George can only report on Tuesday, he must give the Tuesday afternoon report.
Step 2: Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports (if they report at all).
Step 3: If Nina reports on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must report the following day.
Step 4: Helen gives a morning report, so she cannot report on Wednesday (as that would require Nina to report on Tuesday, which would then require Helen to report on Wednesday).
Step 5: Therefore, Helen must report on either Monday or Tuesday morning.
Step 6: If Helen reports on Tuesday morning, then Irving cannot report at all (as he would need to report on Wednesday, which is not possible given the conditions).
Step 7: Therefore, Helen must report on Monday morning, and Irving must report on Tuesday morning.
So, Irving must give a report on Monday.
