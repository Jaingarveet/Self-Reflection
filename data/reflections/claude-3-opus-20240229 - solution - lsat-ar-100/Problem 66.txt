Solution:
Let's carefully consider each constraint:
1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. 
2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
3. S must be earlier than Y.
4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
If R is fourth, then:
- G must be third (since G must be earlier than R)
- J must be second (since J must be earlier than G)
- H must be first (since consecutive articles can't have the same topic)
- Y must be fifth (the only spot left for the wildlife article)
- S must be sixth (since S must be earlier than Y)
- Q must be seventh (the only spot left)
So the unique order is: H, J, G, R, Y, S, Q.
