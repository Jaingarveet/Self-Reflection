Solution:
Given:
 - T is performed 5th and F is performed 6th
 - O is performed 1st (since it can only be 1st or 5th and T is 5th)
 - L or H is performed 8th
 - P is performed before S
 - At least one composition is between O and S
With T, F, O, and L/H positions known, the remaining positions for P, R, and S are 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th.
Since P is before S, the possible arrangements are:
 - P 2nd, R 3rd, S 4th
 - P 2nd, S 3rd, R 4th
 - P 2nd, R 4th, S 7th
 - P 3rd, R 2nd, S 4th
 - P 4th, R 2nd, S 7th
 - P 4th, R 3rd, S 7th
The condition "At least one composition is between O and S" eliminates the arrangements where S is 3rd, leaving:
 - P 2nd, R 3rd, S 4th
 - P 2nd, R 4th, S 7th
 - P 4th, R 2nd, S 7th
Therefore, S must be performed either 4th or 7th.
