Solution:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Exactly [REDACTED] of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and [REDACTED]th solos are traditional.
3. In the [REDACTED]th solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means that if the third and [REDACTED]th solos are traditional, then Wayne could perform the [REDACTED]th solo, but he doesn't have to.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly affect the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least [REDACTED] modern piece. This means that Wayne must perform a modern piece before any traditional piece is performed, but it doesn't require him to perform any traditional pieces.
6. One possible scenario that satisfies all conditions is: 
   - First solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
   - Second solo: Zara performs a modern piece
   - Third solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - Fourth solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - Fifth solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
7. In this scenario, Wayne performs [REDACTED] traditional pieces, which is the minimum possible.
