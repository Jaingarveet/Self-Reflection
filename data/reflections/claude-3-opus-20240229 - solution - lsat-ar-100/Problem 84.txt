Solution:
Given:
 - 8 books: F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O
 - 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
 - At least 2 books per shelf
 - More books on bottom than top
 - I on middle shelf
 - K on higher shelf than F
 - O on higher shelf than L
 - F on same shelf as M
Step 1: Place I on the middle shelf. 
Middle shelf: I
Step 2: Since F and M are on the same shelf, and K is higher than F, F and M must be on the bottom shelf and K on the middle or top.
Bottom shelf: [REDACTED]
Step 3: O is higher than L, so L must be on the bottom shelf.
Bottom shelf: [REDACTED], L
Step 4: We now have 3 books on the bottom shelf, 1 on the middle shelf, and 4 books left to place: [REDACTED], O.
Step 5: To have more books on the bottom than the top, the remaining distribution must be either:
 - Bottom: 4, Middle: 2, Top: 2
 - Bottom: 5, Middle: 2, Top: 1
Step 6: Looking at the answer choices, only [REDACTED] fits one of these distributions. It has F, H, and M on the bottom shelf, which matches the 5-2-1 distribution.
Therefore, [REDACTED] is correct.
