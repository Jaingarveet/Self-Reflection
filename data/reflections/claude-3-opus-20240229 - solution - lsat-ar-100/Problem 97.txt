Solution:
1. The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.
3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
4. No two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day.
5. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Given these constraints:
- The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
- The first batch of sugar cookies can be made on either Monday or Wednesday.
- The second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Thursday or Friday.
- The third batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on either Thursday or Friday.
Therefore, it is not possible for two different kinds of cookies to have their second batch made on Wednesday, as the only second batch that could potentially be made on Wednesday is sugar cookies, but we know the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
