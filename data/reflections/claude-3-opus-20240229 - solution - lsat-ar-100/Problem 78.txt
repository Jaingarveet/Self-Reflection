Solution:
1. George must give his report on Tuesday, as that's the only day he can do so.
2. Robert cannot give an afternoon report. 
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
4. Let's consider the scenario where Nina gives her report on Monday:
   - Nina gives her report on Monday
   - Helen and Irving must then give their reports on Tuesday
   - George gives his report on Tuesday
   - Robert can give his report on Wednesday morning
5. In this scenario, all the constraints are satisfied. Importantly, Helen gives a report on Wednesday, so answer [REDACTED] is a possible scenario.
