Solution:
Given:
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. 
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Step 1: From the first two conditions, we can deduce the relative order of grain, livestock, and textiles:
textiles < livestock < grain
Step 2: From the third condition, we know:
fuel < produce
Step 3: The fourth condition tells us that textiles and produce are in adjacent bays. 
Step 4: Looking at the first three bays (1-3), the only arrangement consistent with steps 1-3 is:
[REDACTED]
This matches answer choice [REDACTED].
