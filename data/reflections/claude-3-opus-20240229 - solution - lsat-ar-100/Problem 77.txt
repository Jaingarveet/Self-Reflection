Solution:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.
5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.
6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
7. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #3 or #4 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
   - Souza: no specific limitation 
   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation
   - Young: must be assigned #2 or #3 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
8. Counting the employees with assignments limited to only [REDACTED] spaces:
   - Togowa, Young, Robertson are each limited to [REDACTED] specific spaces
   - Souza, Vaughn, Xu have no such limitation
Therefore, [REDACTED] employees (Togowa, Young, Robertson, and Vaughn) have their assignment limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.
