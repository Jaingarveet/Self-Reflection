Solution:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so a kitten breed must be featured on day 2.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. 
3. No breed (kitten or puppy) is featured on any two consecutive days. This means that the same kitten breed cannot be featured on consecutive days, but different kitten breeds can.
4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. This doesn't directly affect the kitten breeds.
5. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. This means the kitten breed featured on day 1 (if any) can't be featured on day 7.
Looking at the choices again:
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
[REDACTED]: Satisfies all conditions. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days (2, 4, 7), no kitten breed is repeated on consecutive days, and the breed featured on day 1 (Siamese) is not featured on day 7.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
