Solution:
1. Reynaldo cannot test F, and Yuki cannot test J.
2. Theresa must test H on one of the days. 
3. The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
4. If Theresa tests G on the second day, she must test H on the first day (to satisfy condition 2).
5. Yuki cannot test J on the first day (given condition 1), so he must test either F, G, or H.
6. If Yuki tests F on the first day, Seamus must test F on the second day (given condition 3). This leaves Reynaldo to test H on the second day. But this violates the condition that Theresa must test H.
7. If Yuki tests G on the first day, Seamus must test G on the second day (given condition 3). But this conflicts with Theresa testing G on the second day.
8. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day. Seamus will then test H on the second day (given condition 3).
9. This leaves Reynaldo to test J on the first day and F on the second day.
Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki must test H on the second day.
