Solution:
Given:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
Step 1: Determine Stuckey and Udall's zone.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
- Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both. 
- Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
Step 2: Determine Mahr's zone.
- Mahr works in the same zone as Stuckey.
- Stuckey works in Zone 3.
- Therefore, Mahr also works in Zone 3.
Step 3: Determine possible zones for the remaining representatives.
- Tiao must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and [REDACTED]
- If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1, and Kim could work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
Therefore, the only statement that could be true is:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
