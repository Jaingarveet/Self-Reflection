Solution:
Given:
- There are 7 articles: G, H, J (finance); Q, R, S (nutrition); Y (wildlife) 
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third
- S must be earlier than Y
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R
- G is fourth
If G is fourth, then:
1. J must be first, second, or third (since J must be earlier than G)
2. R must be fifth, sixth, or seventh (since R must be later than G)
3. H can be anywhere except fourth (since G is fourth) and adjacent to J (consecutive articles can't have same topic)
One possible ordering is:
1. S (nutrition)
2. Y (wildlife) 
3. J (finance)
4. G (finance)
5. Q (nutrition)
6. H (finance)
7. R (nutrition)
In this ordering, [REDACTED] Therefore, choice [REDACTED] could be true.
