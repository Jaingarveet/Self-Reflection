Solution:
1. The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one client.
2. The 3-day website target is the longest possible target.
3. Due to the conditions, no client can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
4. Therefore, if a client has [REDACTED], it must also have [REDACTED].
5. There are only three voicemail targets available (1-day, 2-day, 3-day).
6. Image must have the 1-day voicemail target, leaving only the 2-day and 3-day voicemail targets for the other two clients.
7. Thus, only one client can have the 3-day voicemail target, and consequently, only one client can have the 3-day website target.
8. All other targets (1-day website, 2-day website, 2-day voicemail) could potentially be assigned to multiple clients.
