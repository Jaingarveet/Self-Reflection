Solution:
The key insight is that to satisfy the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, the organizer must always select at least [REDACTED], regardless of the specific scenario. Here's why:
1. There are only three Russian novels total. So at most, the organizer could select three Russian novels.
2. To have at least as many French novels as Russian novels, the number of French novels must be greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
3. Therefore, in all possible scenarios, the organizer must select at least [REDACTED].
4. None of the other answer choices are necessarily true in all valid scenarios.
