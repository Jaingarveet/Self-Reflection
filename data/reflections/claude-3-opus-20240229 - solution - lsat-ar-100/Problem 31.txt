Solution:
Let's go through the conditions again and carefully check each answer choice:
1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. 
Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] satisfy this. Choice [REDACTED] does not, as it has two batches of oatmeal cookies on Monday.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] satisfy this. Choice [REDACTED] does not, as no cookies are made on Monday.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
Only Choice [REDACTED] satisfies this, with the second batch of oatmeal (Wednesday) and first batch of peanut butter (Wednesday) on the same day.
4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] all satisfy this condition.
Therefore, the only choice that satisfies all the conditions is [REDACTED].
