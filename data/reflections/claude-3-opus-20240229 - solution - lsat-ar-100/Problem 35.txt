Solution:
1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
5. If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it means that all three batches of one kind of cookie are made before the third batch of the other kind.
6. For this to happen, the day must be Friday, as it's the last day.
7. Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies would be made on Friday in this scenario.
8. Thus, choice [REDACTED], "Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday", could be false.
