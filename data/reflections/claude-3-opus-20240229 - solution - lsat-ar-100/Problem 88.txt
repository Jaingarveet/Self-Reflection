Solution:
Given:
- I is on the middle shelf.
- More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
- K is on a higher shelf than F.
- O is on a higher shelf than L.
- F and M are on the same shelf.
Choice [REDACTED]: I and M are on the same shelf (middle).
- I and M are on the middle shelf.
- F must also be on the middle shelf (same as M).
- K must be on the top shelf (higher than F).
- O must be on the top shelf (higher than L).
- This leaves G, H, and L for the bottom shelf.
- Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top, G, H, and L must all be on the bottom shelf.
Therefore, the arrangement is fully determined:
Top: K, O
Middle: F, I, M
Bottom: G, H, L
