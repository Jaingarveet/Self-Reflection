Solution:
Given:
 - I is on the middle shelf
 - L is on a higher shelf than H
 - O is on a higher shelf than L
 - K is on a higher shelf than F
 - F is on the same shelf as M
 - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
Step 1: Place L and O on the top shelf (since O is higher than L, and L is higher than H).
Step 2: Place I on the middle shelf.
Step 3: Place H on the bottom shelf (since L is higher than H).
Step 4: Place F and M on the same shelf, which must be the middle shelf (since K is higher than F).
Step 5: Place K on the top shelf (since it's higher than F, which is on the middle shelf).
Step 6: Place G on the bottom shelf (the only remaining position).
Therefore, H and M are on the same shelf (the bottom shelf).
