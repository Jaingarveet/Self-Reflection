Solution:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned an ambassadorship. 
2. If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. Conversely, if Jaramillo is not assigned, then Kayne cannot be assigned.
3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. 
4. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.
5. If Jaramillo is not assigned, then Kayne is also not assigned (from 2). This means Novetzke must be assigned (from 1). 
6. If Novetzke and Landon are assigned, Landon must be assigned to Zambia (from 4), and Novetzke must be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen.
7. This leaves Ong to be assigned to the remaining country (Venezuela or Yemen).
8. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned, Kayne must also be unassigned, and the other three candidates must be assigned. So the only possible pair of unassigned candidates is Jaramillo and Kayne.
