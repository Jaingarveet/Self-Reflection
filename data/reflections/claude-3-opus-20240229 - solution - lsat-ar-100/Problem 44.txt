Solution:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can't be featured on days 2, 6, or 7.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or 7. So they must be featured on three of the days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on the same day as Himalayans, or on day 7.
4. If Rottweilers were featured only on day 3 (choice D), then Himalayans would be featured on days 2, 4, and 5 or 6. This satisfies all the constraints.
5. If Rottweilers were featured on day 6 (choice C), then Himalayans would have to be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or 5. But this would mean Rottweilers are featured on more than one day, contradicting choice [REDACTED].
6. Therefore, only choice [REDACTED] could be true given the constraints.
