Solution:
Given:
- Bay 4 is holding produce.
- The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
- The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
- The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
- The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
Step 1: Bay 4 is produce.
Step 2: Textiles must be in bay 3, as it can't be in bay 5 due to the livestock constraint.
Step 3: Livestock must be in bay 5, as it has to be higher than textiles (bay 3) but lower than grain.
Step 4: Grain must be in bay 6, as it has to be higher than livestock (bay 5).
Step 5: Fuel must be in bay 1 or 2, as it has to be lower than produce (bay 4). However, since machinery is the only remaining cargo, and bays 1 and 2 are the only open spots, we can deduce that fuel is in bay 1 and machinery in bay 2.
Therefore, the cargo for all [REDACTED] bays can be completely determined:
1. Fuel
2. Machinery 
3. Textiles
4. Produce
5. Livestock
6. Grain
