Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument required assuming that most employees currently have a short commute. However, the argument does not provide any information about the current commute times. The argument only states that after the move, most employees will have a long commute because they cannot afford housing near Ocean View.
The correct assumption is that there will not be a significant pay raise accompanying the move. If there was a large pay raise, it could allow employees to afford housing near Ocean View, negating the conclusion that most will have a long commute.
