Explanation:
I misinterpreted the role that the assertion about increasing strength and coordination played in the overall argument. I focused too much on the teacher's counterargument about feelings of inferiority leading to success later in life. However, the question was specifically asking about the role of the assertion that athletics may increase strength and coordination.
Looking back, this assertion is actually mentioned as a possible reason to support children's athletic programs, before the teacher goes on to provide an additional reason to maintain funding in spite of the critics' objections. The teacher is not attempting to refute this claim, provide further evidence for it, cite it as an insufficient reason, or mention it as an objection to their own position.
