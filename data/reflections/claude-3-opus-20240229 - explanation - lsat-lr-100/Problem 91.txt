Explanation:
I misinterpreted the passage and focused too much on the variability in allergic reactions between individuals. While the passage does support that no cat causes allergies in all sufferers (Choice B), it more directly states that the specific proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person. This implies that cats must differ in the proteins they produce (Choice C), otherwise the reactions would be the same for everyone. I failed to make this logical connection from the information given.
