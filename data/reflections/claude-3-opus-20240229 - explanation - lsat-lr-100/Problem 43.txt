Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption as being that people should not make promises to do something outside their control. While this is stated in the argument, it is not the key assumption needed for the conclusion to follow. The conclusion that "love" should not be taken to refer to feelings relies on the unstated assumption that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical. I failed to recognize this implicit premise in the argument.
