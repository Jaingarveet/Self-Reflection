Explanation:
I selected choice [REDACTED], thinking that if low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, they could end up absorbing as much total nicotine as high-nicotine cigarette smokers. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED].

I failed to recognize that [REDACTED] provides a full physiological explanation for the observation.
