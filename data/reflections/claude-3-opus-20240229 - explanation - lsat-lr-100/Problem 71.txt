Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that choice [REDACTED] must be true because the museum only displays twentieth-century works and the store sells prints of works from the museum's collection and some that aren't. However, I failed to consider that the store could sell prints of twentieth-century works that are neither on loan to the museum nor part of its permanent collection.
