Explanation:
I incorrectly identified argument [REDACTED] as having the most similar reasoning to the original argument. While [REDACTED] does have some similarities, upon further reflection, argument [REDACTED] is a better match.
The original argument states that if the party's theories were sound and implemented, inflation would have decreased. Since inflation increased, the theories must have been flawed. 
Argument [REDACTED] follows the same structure - if the company sold subsidiaries and bought the patent, the stock price would have doubled. The stock price didn't increase, so the company must have failed to sell the subsidiaries.
In contrast, while argument [REDACTED] has a similar "if X then Y, not Y, therefore not X" structure, the specifics of the reasoning are less analogous to the original argument compared to argument [REDACTED].
