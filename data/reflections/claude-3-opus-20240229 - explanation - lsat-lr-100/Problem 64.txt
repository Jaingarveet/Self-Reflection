Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the argument's assumption that shedding tears is sufficient to reduce emotional stress, overlooking the more fundamental flaw in the reasoning. The argument takes for granted that because stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of emotional stress. However, the mere presence of a substance when a condition occurs does not necessarily mean that the substance causes the condition.
