Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the specific detail about squeaky floors rather than the broader point about the prevalence of fear of ninjas among the Japanese population. Tamara's objection was that many wealthy Japanese feared ninjas, as evidenced by the squeaky floors. I tried to counter this by suggesting the floors were ineffective, but this doesn't address the key issue of how widespread the fear was. The correct answer points out that the wealthy were a small portion of the population, so even if they feared ninjas, this doesn't contradict Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not.
