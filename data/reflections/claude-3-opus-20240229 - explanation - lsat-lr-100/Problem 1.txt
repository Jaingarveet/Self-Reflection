Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if half the country is humid and cold, it would contradict the given information. However, the question states that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees. It does not state that this is true for all parts of the country. Therefore, it is possible for half the country to be humid and cold, while the other half is suitable for either cacti or orange trees.
