Explanation:
I focused too much on the assumption about commercial viability and societal benefit, and not enough on the core logical flaw in the argument - that it assumes an action is unlikely to produce an outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. While [REDACTED] points out a questionable assumption, [REDACTED] more directly addresses the key logical gap.
