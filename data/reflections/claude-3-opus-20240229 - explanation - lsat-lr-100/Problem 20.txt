Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the defendant's excuse and the judge's dismissal of it, rather than on the underlying legal principle that would justify the judge's reasoning. The judge's statement that the excuse might be acceptable for noncompliance with local codes implies that compliance with national codes necessarily means compliance with local codes.
