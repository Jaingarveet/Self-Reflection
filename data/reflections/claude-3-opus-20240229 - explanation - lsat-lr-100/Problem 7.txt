Explanation:
I incorrectly identified argument [REDACTED] as being most similar to the radio producer's argument. While [REDACTED] does present two options and a reason to choose one over the other based on cost, it does not include the key element of a risk if the less preferred option is chosen, which is central to the radio producer's reasoning.
Looking more closely, argument [REDACTED] is the best match. It presents two options (make curtains or buy blinds), states that one option (buying blinds) has a downside that makes it unviable (having to special order them and wait), and concludes that therefore they should choose the other option (make curtains). This closely mirrors the radio producer's argument structure.
