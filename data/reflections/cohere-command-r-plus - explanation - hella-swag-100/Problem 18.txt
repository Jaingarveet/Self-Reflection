Explanation:
I misinterpreted the text's message about grieving and focused too much on the expression of emotions. 
The correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], emphasizes the importance of experiencing and accepting the difficult feelings associated with grief, rather than offering a specific method like journaling. 
My error was in not fully grasping the text's message and jumping to a conclusion too quickly.
