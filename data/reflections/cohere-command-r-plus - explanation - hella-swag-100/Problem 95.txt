Explanation:
I misinterpreted the narrative and made assumptions about the drummer's actions and intentions that were not supported by the text. I expected the story to include a dramatic or emotional reaction ("shakes his head and smiles"), but the correct answer is more practical and relates directly to the context of drumming.
