Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and focused on the incorrect detail. I emphasized the "steaming hot water" and assumed that the next step would involve cooling the drink with ice. However, the question was about the most likely completion of a video description, and the correct answer focused on the camera movement and not the drink preparation.
