Explanation:
I misinterpreted the social context of the situation described in the text. I focused too much on the individual actions of the men and ignored the broader context of the competition and its conclusion. I failed to recognize that the phrase "and the victor has been declared" indicates that the competition has ended and a winner has been announced.
