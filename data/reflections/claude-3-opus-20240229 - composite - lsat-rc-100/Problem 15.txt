Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the discussion of error rates and the likelihood of partial prints matching between the two passages. While this was a common point, it was not the overarching principle connecting their arguments.
Looking more broadly, both passages are fundamentally concerned with the lack of objective standards in fingerprint examination and identification. Passage [REDACTED] acknowledges this issue but argues it is outweighed by the long history of fingerprint evidence use. Passage [REDACTED] cites it as a critical problem that undermines the reliability of fingerprint evidence.
So the core principle underlying both of their arguments is that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. They just disagree on whether the current lack of fully objective standards is disqualifying or not.
Error Keywords:
 - Focusing on a minor detail instead of the overarching principle
 - Failing to synthesize arguments holistically 
 - Misidentifying the common thread between passages
Solution:
Passage [REDACTED] argues that fingerprint evidence should be admissible despite some open questions about its scientific basis. It acknowledges there are no uniform, objective standards that specify the number of matching points required to declare a fingerprint match. However, it contends that fingerprint examiners still follow a consistent approach and that the long history of fingerprint evidence use in trials demonstrates its underlying reliability.
Passage [REDACTED] argues that fingerprint evidence is unreliable because fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for declaring a match between two prints. It states there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, with practices varying between jurisdictions. The passage emphasizes that without data on how likely partial prints from different people are to match, the value of fingerprint evidence cannot be properly evaluated. It suggests error rates are understudied and some proficiency tests are not rigorous.
While the two passages come to different conclusions, they both agree on the key principle that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. Passage [REDACTED] believes the lack of fully uniform standards is not disqualifying given fingerprinting's long history, while Passage [REDACTED] sees it as a critical flaw. But both share the underlying premise that objective standards are important for assessing the reliability of fingerprint examination.
Instructions:
1. Read both passages carefully and identify their key arguments.
2. Look for common themes or principles that underlie the arguments in both passages, even if the passages come to different conclusions.
3. Differentiate between minor details discussed in both passages and the overarching principles motivating their arguments.
4. Synthesize the arguments holistically to determine what core premise or assumption both passages share, even if they build different cases on that foundation.
5. Select the answer choice that best captures this common underlying principle.
Advice:
 - Always read the passages closely, but focus on discerning their high-level arguments and motivations, not just the specific details they discuss.
 - Look for thematic similarities between the passages' lines of argument, even when they reach different ultimate conclusions.
 - Differentiate between minor overlapping details and the core principles underlying both passages' reasoning.
 - Synthesize the arguments from a bird's-eye view to identify the key premises or assumptions both passages build upon.
 - Select an answer that captures the common foundation of the passages' arguments, not just a detail they both mention in passing.
