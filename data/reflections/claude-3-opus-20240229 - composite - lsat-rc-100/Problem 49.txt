Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on the idea that proverb use conveys a sense of ethnicity to children in Mexican American communities. While the passage does discuss this, it is not the most strongly implied point. I overlooked the more fundamental implication about the nature of proverbs themselves.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting main implication 
 - Focusing on supporting detail instead of main point
 - Overlooking key definitional information
Solution:
The passage states: "The term 'proverb' refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom." It then goes on to say: "Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs."
Taken together, these two statements most strongly imply choice [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This is a direct restatement of the key definitional points made about proverbs in the passage.
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully to identify what is being asked (e.g., main point, implication, etc.).
2. Re-read the passage, highlighting or underlining key definitional statements or explanations of core concepts.
3. Analyze each answer choice in turn, referring back to the highlighted portions of the passage.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly supported by the passage.
5. Select the answer choice that most closely matches or restates the key ideas in the passage, with a focus on what is most strongly implied rather than merely mentioned.
Advice:
 - Always pay close attention to sentences that define key terms or explain important concepts, as these often contain the main ideas of the passage.
 - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is mentioned in the passage; look for the choice that is most strongly implied or supported by the passage as a whole.
 - If you're torn between two answers, refer back to the question stem to determine which one is a better fit for what is being asked.
 - Don't make assumptions or read things into the passage that aren't there; stick closely to what is directly stated or implied.
