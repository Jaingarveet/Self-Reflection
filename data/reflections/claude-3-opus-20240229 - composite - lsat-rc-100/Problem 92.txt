Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] as the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. While [REDACTED] points out that some non-Western societies also use their own methods to study other cultures, it does not directly address the key point of the criticism - that using external methods prevents genuine understanding. Answer choice [REDACTED], on the other hand, directly challenges the criticism's claim that real understanding requires adopting the internal perspectives of the studied culture.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting the main point of an argument
 - Failing to identify the most relevant counterargument
 - Focusing on tangential details rather than core issues
Solution:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education argues that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism. It claims that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the internal perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Answer choice [REDACTED] directly challenges this criticism by arguing that it is impossible to truly adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. If this is true, then the criticism's proposed solution - studying cultures using their own internal methods - is not feasible. This undermines the criticism by suggesting its key claim is impossible to implement.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the passage to identify the main arguments and criticisms.
2. Analyze each answer choice to determine how it relates to the criticism being discussed.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to directly address the key points of the criticism.
4. Select the answer choice that most directly challenges or undermines the reasoning of the criticism.
5. Double-check that the selected answer is the strongest objection among the available choices.
Advice:
 - Always focus on the core issues and main points of arguments, rather than getting sidetracked by tangential details.
 - When evaluating objections, look for counterarguments that directly challenge the reasoning or assumptions of the argument being criticized.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to engage with the key points under discussion.
 - Remember that the strongest objection will be the one that most fundamentally undermines the reasoning of the argument being challenged.
