Explanation:
I incorrectly chose an answer that directly contradicted the author's assertion, rather than one that called it into question more subtly. Choice [REDACTED] suggests earlier African American writers had used musical structures in their novels before Morrison, which would clearly negate the author's point. However, the question asked for the choice that would most call the assertion into question, not definitively disprove it. Choice [REDACTED] does this in a more nuanced way by suggesting that all novels are inherently somewhat musical, which undermines the idea that Morrison's use of jazz structure was uniquely groundbreaking.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpreted question 
- Focused on direct contradiction instead of calling into question
- Failed to consider subtle implications
- Overlooked best answer in favor of more obvious wrong answer
Solution:
The author asserts in lines 11-16 that while many African American authors have incorporated music/musicians thematically into their works, Toni Morrison was the first to use a musical genre (jazz) as the organizing structural principle for an entire novel in her 1992 book Jazz.
Choice [REDACTED] suggests that, to some extent, any novel can be considered musical in nature, especially if read aloud. This calls into question whether Morrison's use of jazz structure was truly a unique innovation. If all novels are inherently musical, then perhaps Morrison was simply the first to explicitly highlight that musicality, rather than pioneering a completely new approach. While Choice [REDACTED] doesn't definitively contradict the author's assertion, it invites doubt by implying that the musical qualities Morrison employed may be more universal to the novel form than the author acknowledges.
Instructions:
1. Identify the specific assertion being tested by the question.
2. Consider each answer choice carefully in terms of how it relates to that assertion. 
3. Don't just look for direct contradiction; consider more subtle implications that could call the assertion into doubt without disproving it entirely.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are overly broad, irrelevant to the specific assertion, or actually support the assertion.
5. Select the choice that most effectively calls the targeted assertion into question, even if indirectly.
Advice:
- Always read questions carefully to ensure you're selecting an answer choice that fits all criteria. 
- Consider each choice in light of the specific assertion or argument being tested.
- Don't get tunnel vision looking only for direct counterarguments; more subtle challenges to an argument can be equally or more effective.
- Eliminate choices methodically based on relevance to the assertion and the question being asked.
- Select the choice that best fulfills the question, even if it's not the most obvious at first glance.
