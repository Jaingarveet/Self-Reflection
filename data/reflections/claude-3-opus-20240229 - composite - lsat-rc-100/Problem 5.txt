Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the passage as differentiating Dostoyevsky's position from both of the other two positions in detail. Upon re-reading, I see that while the passage does mention the first position briefly, it only goes into detail differentiating Dostoyevsky's view from the second, radical position. The first position is not elaborated on significantly.
Error Keywords:
 - Reading comprehension error
 - Passage structure misinterpretation 
 - Failure to distinguish levels of detail given to different points
Solution:
1. The passage introduces two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism:
   a) Art should stand above everyday reality (not elaborated in detail)
   b) Art should be grounded in concrete reality and be useful to society (radical view)
2. Dostoyevsky's third position is then introduced and elaborated in detail:
   - Reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper
   - No distinction between fantasy and reality; reality shaped by the experiencer
   - Writer's task is to explode boundaries of the so-called real world
   - Art should be judged on "artistic merit", not political utility
   - Artistic merit means expressing thoughts well in characters and images
   - Usefulness of art can't always be precisely measured
3. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated in detail primarily from the second, radical position. The first position is not significantly elaborated on.
Therefore, the passage presents three positions, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the second radical position in detail.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully, identifying the main positions or arguments presented.
2. Note how much detail is provided for each position.
3. Determine which positions are elaborated on and which are mentioned more briefly.
4. Identify any positions that are directly compared or contrasted.
5. Determine which position, if any, is given the most detailed treatment.
6. Select the answer choice that best captures the structure you've identified.
Advice:
 - Always read passages carefully, taking note of the main ideas and how they are developed.
 - Pay attention to the level of detail given to each idea to understand their relative importance.
 - Look for direct comparisons or contrasts between ideas, as these often indicate the passage's structure.
 - Don't assume ideas are elaborated equally; some may be explained in more depth than others.
 - Make sure your answer choice accurately reflects the structure you've identified in the passage.
