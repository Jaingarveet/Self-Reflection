Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between the two sentences. The sentence in lines 28-31 does not agree with the position stated in lines 7-11, even in a general sense. Instead, it presents the author's own opinion which opposes the view reported earlier that lawyers should always represent defendants regardless of their own beliefs about the client's guilt or innocence.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of author's opinion
 - Failure to identify contrasting viewpoints
 - Incorrect analysis of textual relationships
Solution:
The sentence in lines 7-11 reports the view of some legal scholars that lawyers should represent defendants in court regardless of their own judgments about the defendant's guilt or innocence. 
In contrast, the sentence in lines 28-31 expresses the author's own opinion that lawyers should try to prove a client's innocence only in cases where the lawyer sincerely believes the client may be innocent. This implies that if the lawyer believes the client is guilty, they should not attempt to prove innocence.
Thus, the author's opinion in lines 28-31 opposes the view reported in lines 7-11. The author believes a lawyer's actions should depend on their belief in the client's innocence, while the earlier reported view states lawyers should always represent defendants without judging guilt or innocence themselves.
Instructions:
1. Carefully identify the key sentences referenced in the question.
2. Determine what viewpoint or idea each sentence expresses. 
3. Analyze whether the viewpoints in the sentences agree, disagree, or have some other relationship.
4. Consider whether either sentence reports someone else's view rather than stating the author's own opinion.
5. Determine the most accurate description of the relationship between the sentences based on your analysis.
Advice:
 - Always read referenced sentences carefully in context of the surrounding text.
 - Distinguish between the author expressing their own views versus reporting the views of others.
 - Look for keywords that signal agreement, disagreement or contrast between ideas.
 - Map out the key ideas in each sentence and directly compare them to determine relationships.
 - Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately describe the sentence relationship based on the text.
