**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Focus misidentification

## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the core argument:** The second paragraph argues that understanding other cultures requires considering their unique historical and social contexts, as these shape their value systems.
2.  **Analyze answer choices:** 
    *   A is incorrect as it contradicts the idea of understanding different cultures.
    *   B aligns with the argument by highlighting the role of historical and social circumstances in shaping values.
    *   C, while seemingly related, goes beyond the paragraph's scope by suggesting the necessity of multiple perspectives.
    *   D contradicts the paragraph's argument by implying understanding is impossible without shared values.
    *   E is unrelated as it discusses understanding liberalism, not other cultures.
