## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the positive outcomes of the test case strategy and its adoption by other public interest lawyers. I failed to consider the context of the passage, which emphasizes the novelty and innovation of Marshall's approach at the time.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on outcome over context
*   Ignoring historical context
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Review the question:** The question asks about the author's view of the test case strategy, specifically focusing on how it was perceived when developed by Marshall.
2.  **Identify relevant information:** The passage states, "during the 1940s and 1950s, in their campaign against state-sanctioned racial segregation, Marshall and the NAACP, instead of simply pursuing cases as the opportunity arose, set up a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated." This suggests a deliberate and planned approach, contrasting with the previous norms.
3.  **Analyze the answer choices:**
    *   A: Arbitrary - The passage emphasizes the strategic nature of the approach, making this unlikely.
    *   B: Inflexible - The passage doesn't provide information about the flexibility of the strategy.
    *   C: Unprecedented - This aligns with the passage's emphasis on innovation and changing the landscape of public interest law.
    *   D: Necessary - While the strategy was effective, the passage doesn't explicitly state it was the only possible approach.
    *   E: Subjective - The passage focuses on the objective planning and execution of the strategy.
4.  **Choose the best answer:** Based on the analysis, **C: Unprecedented** is the most reasonable inference about the author's view of the test case strategy.
