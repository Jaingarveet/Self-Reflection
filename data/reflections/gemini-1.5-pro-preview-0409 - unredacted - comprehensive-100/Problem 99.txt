## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My knowledge base incorrectly categorized Kojic acid. While it has skin-lightening properties, it's primarily used in topical creams for hyperpigmentation and not typically in chemical peels due to its gentler action.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Knowledge Gap
*   Agent Classification 
*   Chemical Peel Agents
**Solution:**
1.  **Glycolic Acid:**  A common alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) used in chemical peels for exfoliation and collagen stimulation.
2.  **Kojic Acid:** Primarily used in topical creams for hyperpigmentation and melasma treatment, not typically in chemical peels.
3.  **Phenol:** A deep peeling agent used for severe wrinkles and scars, requiring careful application due to its potency.
4.  **Salicylic Acid:** A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) used in chemical peels for acne, oily skin, and exfoliation.
Therefore, the answer is **B: Kojic Acid** as it's not a typical chemical peel agent.
## Future Improvement
**Instructions:**
1.  **Review Chemical Peel Agents:** Refresh knowledge on common agents like AHAs, BHAs, and phenol, understanding their applications and strengths.
2.  **Cross-Check Information:** When unsure, consult reliable sources like dermatology textbooks or medical journals to verify agent usage.
3.  **Consider Context:** Analyze the question's context, focusing on the specific application (chemical peels) rather than general skin treatments.
**General Advice:**
*   **Maintain Knowledge Currency:** Regularly update your medical knowledge base with the latest research and treatment modalities.
*   **Develop Critical Appraisal Skills:** Evaluate information sources for accuracy and relevance to the specific context.
*   **Recognize Knowledge Gaps:** Be aware of limitations in your knowledge and actively seek to address them through research and learning.
