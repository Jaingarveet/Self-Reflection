Instructions:

1. Review the pathophysiology of cicatricial pemphigoid.
2. Understand the components of the basement membrane zone that are targeted by autoantibodies in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid.
3. Recognize that [REDACTED] (collagen type XVII) is the primary antigen targeted by autoantibodies in cicatricial pemphigoid.
4. In the salt split skin technique, identify the antigen that IgG autoantibodies in the patient's serum will bind to on the epidermal side of the split skin.
5. Choose the correct answer, [REDACTED] (A), as the target antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid.
