Explanation: My initial reasoning was flawed because I overlooked the condition that Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone. I focused on the relationships between Tiao, Parra, and Udall, and their potential presence in Zone 3, without considering the placement of the other employees. 

Error Keywords:

- Incomplete analysis
- Misinterpretation of conditions

Solution: 
Let's break down the conditions and relationships step by step: 

1. Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone.
2. Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both.
4. Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, but not both.
5. Given that more reps are in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall are together, they must be in Zone 3. 
6. Now, we can place the remaining reps. Kim, Mahr, or both must be in Zone 3 to satisfy the condition of more reps in Zone 3 than Zone 2. 
7. Therefore, the list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is: Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given conditions and relationships between employees and zones. 
2. Start with the definite relationships: Parra-Quinn and Stuckey-Udall. 
3. Consider the mutual exclusivity conditions for Zones 1 and 2. 
4. Given the condition about Zone 3, place Stuckey and Udall there. 
5. Place the remaining employees based on the conditions and available zones. 
6. Ensure that all conditions are satisfied and that the placement adheres to the question's constraints. 

Advice: 
- Carefully read and identify all given conditions and relationships. 
- Begin with definite relationships and work step by step from there. 
- Consider all conditions and their implications systematically. 
- Avoid focusing on a subset of conditions while neglecting others. 
- Ensure your placement satisfies all constraints and conditions.
