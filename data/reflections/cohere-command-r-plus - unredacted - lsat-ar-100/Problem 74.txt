Explanation: I misinterpreted the constraints and made assumptions that led me to choose the wrong answer. I incorrectly assumed that Ong and Kayne could not both be assigned, which directed me towards answer choice D. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Assumption
- Overlooked constraints

Solution: 
Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:
- Landon must be assigned to Zambia, as stated in the constraints.
- Ong can be assigned to Venezuela, as it is only stated that Kayne "cannot be assigned to Yemen" if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which does not preclude other options.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne must also be assigned per the constraints.
- Novetzke cannot be assigned per the constraints, as either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned.

Based on these deductions, we can determine that Jaramillo and Novetzke are the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships. 

Instructions:
1. Read and understand the context and constraints carefully.
2. Identify the given constraints:
    - Landon, if assigned, must go to Zambia.
    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned.
    - If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
    - If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
3. Deduce the assignments based on the constraints:
    - Landon is assigned to Zambia.
    - Kayne and Jaramillo can be assigned, but not with Ong assigned to Venezuela.
    - Novetzke cannot be assigned due to the constraint.
4. Determine the pair of candidates who are not assigned:
    - Given the above, it is clear that Jaramillo and Novetzke are the pair who are not assigned.
5. Choose the answer choice that reflects this deduction.

Advice:
- Read and understand the context and constraints thoroughly before answering.
- Identify and clearly understand each constraint and its implications.
- Do not make assumptions beyond what is stated in the context and constraints.
- Consider all possibilities and deduce the most likely outcomes based on the given information.
- Create a table or diagram to organize the information and test different scenarios to help identify the correct answer.
