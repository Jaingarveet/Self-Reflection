Explanation: I made an error in interpreting the constraints and their implications for the relative positions of the businesses. I overlooked the impact of the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian and instead focused solely on the pharmacy and restaurant constraints. 

Error Keywords:
- Logical error
- Constraint misinterpretation
- Omission error (overlooking a constraint)

Solution: 

Given Constraints: 
- Pharmacy at one end, restaurant at the other
- Restaurants separated by at least two businesses
- Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian
- Toy store cannot be next to veterinarian

Additional Inferences: 
- As the pharmacy and a restaurant must be at the ends, the optometrist and shoe store cannot occupy the end spaces. 
- The optometrist and shoe store must be adjacent to each other, leaving five spaces for the other businesses. 
- The toy store and veterinarian can be together, as this pair can be separated from the restaurant by two businesses. 

Final Arrangement: 
1. Pharmacy
2. Veterinarian
3. Toy Store
4. Optometrist
5. Shoe Store
6. Restaurant
7. Restaurant

The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store are the toy store and a restaurant. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given constraints and their implications for business arrangements. 
2. Draw out the potential arrangements based on these constraints. 
3. Consider the additional constraints and their impact on the arrangements. 
4. Eliminate arrangements that violate these constraints. 
5. Identify the final arrangement that satisfies all constraints. 
6. Determine the businesses on either side of the optometrist and shoe store in this arrangement. 

Advice: 
 - Identify all constraints and their implications. 
 - Consider the cumulative impact of constraints, as they may interact in complex ways. 
 - Avoid focusing solely on a subset of constraints; ensure you consider their collective effect. 
 - Draw or visualize potential arrangements to aid in understanding their validity. 
 - Double-check your interpretation of each constraint and its impact on the arrangement.
