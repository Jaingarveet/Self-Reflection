Explanation: 
I misinterpreted condition 5, misunderstanding which pianist could perform the first and second solos consecutively. I also did not consider all possible scenarios and the implications of each condition.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incomplete analysis
- Insufficient consideration of conditions
Solution: 
Given that the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, we know this pianist cannot be Wayne, due to condition 5. Therefore, the pianist must be Zara. Now, let's consider the remaining conditions:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece.
2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece, or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.

From condition 4, we know that Zara, who performed the second solo, cannot perform the fifth solo. Therefore, the correct answer is choice C: Zara performs the fifth solo.
Instructions: 
1. Read and understand all the conditions provided in the question.
2. Identify the given condition: "The pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo."
3. Interpret the conditions correctly: Recognize that condition 5 implies that Wayne cannot perform both the first and second solos consecutively.
4. Deduce that if the first and second solos are performed by the same pianist, it must be Zara.
5. Consider the implications of each condition on the possible sequences of pianists and solo types.
6. Determine which of the provided choices must be true based on the given conditions and your deductions.
