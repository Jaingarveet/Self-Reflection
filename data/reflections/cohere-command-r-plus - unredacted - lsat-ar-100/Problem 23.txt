Explanation: I misinterpreted the conditions and made assumptions that led me to choose the incorrect answer. I overlooked the possibility of Nina giving a report on Monday, which would have resulted in Helen and Irving giving reports on Tuesday, keeping with the condition.

Solution: 
Given that Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, we can deduce the following: 

Tuesday: George (morning), Kyle (afternoon)
Wednesday: Irving (morning), Helen (afternoon)

Now, considering the condition that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, we can conclude that Nina could give a report on Monday or Tuesday. 

If Nina gives a report on Monday morning, then the list of students giving morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday would be: Nina, [gap], Irving. This does not satisfy the conditions, as there is no clear student who could give the morning report on Tuesday. 

However, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday morning, following Tuesday afternoon's report by Kyle, then the list becomes: [gap], Nina, [gap]. This satisfies the condition that Helen and Irving give reports the next day, i.e., Wednesday morning and afternoon, respectively. 

Therefore, the list of students giving morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is: [Monday], Robert or Olivia, [Tuesday: Nina], [Wednesday: Irving]. 

The correct answer, based on these deductions, is D: Robert, George, and Irving.

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given conditions and reports for Tuesday and Wednesday. 
2. Deduce the possible days for Nina's report, considering the conditions. 
3. Determine the impact of Nina's report on the schedule and identify the students who must give reports on subsequent days. 
4. Fill in the gaps in the schedule with the remaining students. 
5. Ensure that the final schedule adheres to all conditions. 
6. Choose the answer choice that matches your deduced schedule.
