Explanation: I misinterpreted the condition that "Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets." I incorrectly assumed that it could be one day, but as the correct answer reveals, it must be one day, leaving the website target to be two days.

- Misinterpretation
- Assumption
- Logic error

Solution: Given that Image's website target is 2 days, we can deduce the following:
- Image's voicemail target must be 1 day, as it is specified to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and the options are limited to 1, 2, or 3 days.
- Solide's website target can be 1 or 3 days. It cannot be 2 days because that would make it equal to Image's website target, and it must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- Truvest's website target can now be determined to be either 2 or 3 days. It must be longer than Solide's, and the only options remaining are 2 or 3 days.
- Truvest's voicemail target can be 1, 2, or 3 days. It simply needs to be longer than Image's voicemail target, which is 1 day.

Therefore, the correct answer is Image's voicemail target, as it must be 1 day, leaving the website target at 2 days.
