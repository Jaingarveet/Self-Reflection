Explanation: I misinterpreted the requirement "At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected" and incorrectly ruled out choice C based on this criterion. In reality, this requirement means that the number of selected French novels should be greater than or equal to the number of selected Russian novels, allowing for several valid combinations, including three French novels and one Russian novel, as in choice C.

- Incorrect assumption
- Overlooking options

Solution: 
The requirements allow for flexibility in the selection of works, and choice C adheres to all the conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Three French novels can be selected, satisfying the requirement of "at least five and at most six works" in total.
2. One Russian novel can be chosen, fulfilling the criteria of selecting at least three novels and ensuring that the number of French novels is greater than or equal to the number of Russian novels.
3. With the selection of three French novels and one Russian novel, the condition of selecting "at most four French works" is met.
4. The Russian play can be included in the selection, as the criteria mention that if both French plays are chosen, the Russian play cannot be. In this case, only one French play is chosen, so the Russian play is permissible.

Instructions: 
1. Identify the explicit requirements stated in the question.
2. Interpret each requirement accurately and independently. 
3. Understand the relationships between the works of literature based on their nationalities and genres. 
4. For each choice, independently assess whether it meets each requirement. 
5. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions based on partial assessments. 
6. Ensure that all requirements are satisfied for the chosen answer. 

Advice: 
 - Read the question and requirements carefully, multiple times if needed, to fully understand the relationships and constraints between the works of literature. 
 - Avoid making hasty conclusions or eliminating choices based on partial assessments. 
 - Consider each requirement independently and assess each choice against all requirements collectively. 
 - Remember that the requirements are interrelated and should be considered as a whole when evaluating the options. 
 - Always double-check your interpretation of the requirements and their application to each choice.
