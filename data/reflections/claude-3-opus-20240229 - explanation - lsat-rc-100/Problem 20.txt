Explanation:
Upon re-reading the passage, I realize that my initial interpretation of the author's attitude towards the twofold obligation was incorrect. The author does not explicitly state that the twofold obligation enables lawyers to balance their responsibilities or that it prevents them from representing guilty clients. Instead, the author argues that the twofold obligation ultimately benefits the defendant because it ensures that the "best defense" is provided by a lawyer who is convinced of the merits of the case after careful analysis. The author does not suggest that the twofold obligation creates a conflict of interest for defense lawyers.
