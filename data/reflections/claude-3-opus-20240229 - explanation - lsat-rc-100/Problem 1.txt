Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the critics' objection to using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures. While this is a key point, I overlooked that the critics would also likely object to using the theories or values of one culture to criticize another culture with different values. My error was in not fully considering all aspects of the critics' perspective.
