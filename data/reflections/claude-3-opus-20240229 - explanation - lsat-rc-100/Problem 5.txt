Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the passage as differentiating Dostoyevsky's position from both of the other two positions in detail. Upon re-reading, I see that while the passage does mention the first position briefly, it only goes into detail differentiating Dostoyevsky's view from the second, radical position. The first position is not elaborated on significantly.
