Explanation:
I misinterpreted the purpose of the railroad example in the context of the passage. The railroad industry is not being used to illustrate the difficulty of mathematically modeling increasing returns (the Pin Factory concept). Rather, it is an example that highlights the limitations of focusing too heavily on the Invisible Hand concept, which assumes diminishing returns.
