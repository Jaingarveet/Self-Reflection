Explanation:
Upon further reflection, I see that I misinterpreted the focus and scope of the two passages. Passage [REDACTED] is narrowly focused on the specific court case and the defendant's challenges to the fingerprint evidence used against him. In contrast, Passage [REDACTED] takes a broader view, discussing the general lack of objective standards and unknown error rates in fingerprint identification as a whole. Passage [REDACTED] does not focus on the specific court case mentioned in Passage [REDACTED].
