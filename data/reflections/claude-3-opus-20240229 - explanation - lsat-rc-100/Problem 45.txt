Explanation:
I focused too heavily on the advantages of digital publishing mentioned in the passage, such as the ability to keep books perpetually "in print" and the economic efficiency. However, I overlooked the key point the author makes about what will drive the transition to the digital model.
The author argues that the demands of literary agents for higher author royalties will pressure traditional publishers to adapt to the digital model or lose authors to digital-only publishers. This is the primary impetus for the transition that the author identifies.
