Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the discussion of error rates and the likelihood of partial prints matching between the two passages. While this was a common point, it was not the overarching principle connecting their arguments.
Looking more broadly, both passages are fundamentally concerned with the lack of objective standards in fingerprint examination and identification. Passage [REDACTED] acknowledges this issue but argues it is outweighed by the long history of fingerprint evidence use. Passage [REDACTED] cites it as a critical problem that undermines the reliability of fingerprint evidence.
So the core principle underlying both of their arguments is that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. They just disagree on whether the current lack of fully objective standards is disqualifying or not.
