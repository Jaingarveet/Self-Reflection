Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] as the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. While [REDACTED] points out that some non-Western societies also use their own methods to study other cultures, it does not directly address the key point of the criticism - that using external methods prevents genuine understanding. Answer choice [REDACTED], on the other hand, directly challenges the criticism's claim that real understanding requires adopting the internal perspectives of the studied culture.
