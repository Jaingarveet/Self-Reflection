Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between the two sentences. The sentence in lines 28-31 does not agree with the position stated in lines 7-11, even in a general sense. Instead, it presents the author's own opinion which opposes the view reported earlier that lawyers should always represent defendants regardless of their own beliefs about the client's guilt or innocence.
