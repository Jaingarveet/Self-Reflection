Explanation:
I incorrectly chose an answer that directly contradicted the author's assertion, rather than one that called it into question more subtly. Choice [REDACTED] suggests earlier African American writers had used musical structures in their novels before Morrison, which would clearly negate the author's point. However, the question asked for the choice that would most call the assertion into question, not definitively disprove it. Choice [REDACTED] does this in a more nuanced way by suggesting that all novels are inherently somewhat musical, which undermines the idea that Morrison's use of jazz structure was uniquely groundbreaking.
