## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I overlooked the implications of condition 2 in combination with the inability to visit Lake J. I focused on the necessity of visiting Lake G but failed to consider the specific conditions required to visit it.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Condition interpretation error
*   Incomplete analysis
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Cannot visit Lake J:** Due to climate and condition 4, visiting I Peak is impossible, making Lake J inaccessible.
2. **Must visit Lake G:** Condition 1 mandates visiting either Lake G or Lake J. Since Lake J is ruled out, Lake G becomes mandatory.
3. **Conditions for Lake G:** Condition 2 states that visiting Lake G requires visiting either City E or City F.
4. **Eliminate City E:** Condition 3 links visiting Mountain H with City E. Since the question doesn't confirm visiting Mountain H, we cannot assume visiting City E.
5. **Therefore, City F:** The only remaining option to fulfill condition 2 and visit Lake G is by visiting City F.
**Conclusion:** The team must have visited City F and Lake G. So, the correct answer is **D**.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Carefully analyze each condition:** Understand the relationships and dependencies between different locations and actions.
2. **Consider all possibilities:** Don't jump to conclusions based on partial information. Explore all potential scenarios before eliminating options.
3. **Pay attention to dependencies:** Identify which conditions rely on others and how they influence the possible outcomes.
4. **Eliminate options systematically:** Use the given conditions to rule out scenarios that contradict the information provided.
5. **Focus on what must be true:** Avoid assumptions and choose the answer that is guaranteed by the given conditions, not just a possibility.
## General Advice for Logic Problems
*   **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts to analyze each aspect individually.
*   **Draw diagrams or flowcharts:** Visualizing the relationships between conditions can aid in understanding the problem.
*   **Work backward from the question:** Start with the desired outcome and trace back the steps needed to reach it.
*   **Practice with similar problems:** The more you expose yourself to logic puzzles, the better you'll become at identifying patterns and applying reasoning skills.
