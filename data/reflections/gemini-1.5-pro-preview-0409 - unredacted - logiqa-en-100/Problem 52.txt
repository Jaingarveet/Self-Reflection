## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused solely on the inverse relationship between wages and profit, neglecting the potential for conflict of interest implied by this relationship. While option D seemed plausible, it wasn't necessarily the strongest conclusion supported by the context.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of context
*   Ignoring implications
*   Focusing on a single aspect
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the context:** The statement establishes an inverse relationship between wages (cost) and profit, implying that the boss's gain is the employees' loss and vice versa.
2.  **Evaluate options based on the context:**
    *   Options A and B introduce irrelevant information about shares.
    *   Option D, while seemingly related, doesn't directly address the conflict of interest implied by the context.
    *   Option C aligns with the context, suggesting a conflict of interest arises when employees don't share in the profits (i.e., no shares), as their wages are inversely related to the boss's profit.
3.  **Choose the strongest conclusion:** Option C is the most strongly supported conclusion as it directly addresses the potential conflict of interest arising from the inverse relationship between wages and profit.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Thoroughly analyze the context:** Identify the key relationships and implications presented in the statement.
2.  **Evaluate each option based on the context:** Eliminate options that introduce irrelevant information or don't align with the context.
3.  **Consider the implications and potential conflicts:** Look beyond the surface-level information and identify potential conflicts of interest or underlying assumptions.
4.  **Choose the option that is most strongly supported by the context and its implications.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read the context carefully and consider all its implications.**
*   **Don't focus on a single aspect of the problem; consider the bigger picture.**
*   **Be mindful of potential biases or assumptions in your reasoning.**
*   **Evaluate all options critically before choosing the most strongly supported conclusion.**
