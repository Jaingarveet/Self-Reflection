## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused too much on eliminating options based on Zhao and Liu's placement, neglecting the possibility of other valid arrangements. I also misinterpreted statement (4) as providing less information than it actually did.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of conditional statement
*   Overlooking possibilities
*   Focusing on irrelevant information
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Statements:**
    *   (1) Li is in Tianshu.
    *   (2) Zhao is not in Tianshu (due to 1).
    *   (3) Liu and Zhao are in the same unit (not Tianshu due to 2).
    *   (4) If Zhang is in Tianxuan, then Wang is also in Tianxuan (contrapositive: if Wang is NOT in Tianxuan, then Zhang is NOT in Tianxuan).
2.  **Evaluate Options:**
    *   A: Li and Liu cannot be together (Li is in Tianshu, Liu is not).
    *   B: This option is uncertain based on the given information.
    *   **C: This option contradicts statement (3) as Liu and Zhao must be together.** 
    *   D: This option is possible if Wang is in Tianxuan (forcing Zhang out due to 4) and Zhao & Liu are in Tianji.
3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is the only one that doesn't contradict any of the given statements and is therefore a possible correct answer. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Carefully analyze each statement, identifying the information it provides and any constraints it imposes.**
2.  **Pay close attention to conditional statements and consider their contrapositives.**
3.  **Consider all possibilities that do not contradict the given information.**
4.  **Eliminate options that directly contradict any of the statements.**
5.  **Choose the option that remains possible based on the analysis.**
## General Advice
*   **Break down complex logical problems into smaller, manageable pieces.**
*   **Focus on the relationships between individuals or elements based on the given statements.**
*   **Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid making assumptions not supported by the information provided.**
*   **Practice with various logic problems to improve your reasoning and analytical skills.**
