## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the reason why people might not hire college students as nannies, but I failed to consider the specific discrepancy between favoring the idea and actual hiring. Option D provides a reason for disapproval but doesn't explain the contradiction between approval and action.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of question
*   Focusing on disapproval instead of discrepancy
*   Ignoring relevant information in answer choices
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the Discrepancy:** The problem highlights a contradiction: people favor the idea of college student nannies but wouldn't hire them.
2.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** We need an option that explains this gap between attitude and action.
3.  **Option C Analysis:** This option reveals that while many favor the idea, their reasoning is based on the benefit for the students, not the quality of service. This explains why they wouldn't hire them â€“ they don't believe they'd get better service.
