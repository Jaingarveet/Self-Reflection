## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the nature of Xiao Wang's refutation. I focused on the alternative explanation provided by Xiao Wang and categorized it as a direct refutation of Xiao Chen's conclusion. However, the core of Xiao Wang's argument lies in highlighting the lack of evidence supporting Xiao Chen's claim of "unusual scene" due to the limitations of past observations.
