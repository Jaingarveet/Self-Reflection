Explanation:
I focused on finding a structure that matched the pattern "All A are B, C is not B, therefore C is not A" but neglected to consider the direction of the implication. The correct structure should be "All B are A, C is not A, therefore C is not B".
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Implication direction error
 - Negation error
Solution:
The given argument states: All landscape rooms (B) can see the landscape (A), Li Wenbing's family (C) can't see the landscape (not A), therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room (not B).
Option D follows the correct structure: Anyone who meets the basic conditions (B) can apply for a small loan (A), Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan (not A), therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions (not B).
Instructions:
1. Identify the subject, predicate, and direction of implication in the original argument.
2. Look for an option with the same subject-predicate relationship and implication direction.
3. Pay close attention to negations and ensure they align correctly.
4. Verify that the conclusion logically follows from the premises in the chosen option.
Advice:
 - Carefully analyze the logical structure of the given argument, including the direction of implication.
 - Pay attention to negations and their impact on the argument's validity.
 - Consider all options and eliminate those that do not match the logical structure or direction of implication.
 - Focus on understanding the reasoning process rather than just matching patterns. 
 - Practice with various logical reasoning problems to improve your skills in identifying valid arguments.
