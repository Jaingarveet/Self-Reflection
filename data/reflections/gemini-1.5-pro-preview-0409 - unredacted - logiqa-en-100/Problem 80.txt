## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from not fully exploring the possible arrangements of departments, particularly the placement of the R&D department. I focused on avoiding direct adjacency between HR and Sales but overlooked the possibility of R&D being positioned between them, which would still satisfy condition (1).
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Incomplete analysis
*   Overlooking possibilities
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Finance and Planning:** From (2), Finance is directly above Planning. This pair can be placed at the bottom two floors or the top two floors for now.
2.  **Admin between Planning and HR:** From (3), Admin must be above Planning but below HR. This means HR cannot be directly above Planning.
3.  **HR and Sales not adjacent:** From (1), there must be at least one floor between HR and Sales.
**Analyzing Choices:**
*   **A:** Finance, Planning, Admin, HR, **R&D**, Sales (Satisfies all conditions)
*   **B:** Finance, Planning, Admin, HR, Sales, **R&D** (Violates condition 3 as R&D is directly above Sales)
*   **C and D:** Both violate condition 2 as Admin is not between Planning and HR.
**Therefore, the correct answer is A.**
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving:
1.  **Identify fixed relationships:** Note pairs or sequences of elements with fixed positions relative to each other.
2.  **Identify restrictions:** Note conditions that prevent certain elements from being adjacent or having specific positions.
3.  **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different arrangements that satisfy the fixed relationships and restrictions, even if they seem unlikely at first.
4.  **Eliminate options:** Rule out choices that violate any of the given conditions.
5.  **Verify the remaining option:** Ensure the remaining choice satisfies all conditions before finalizing the answer.
## General Advice for Similar Problems:
*   **Visualize:** Draw diagrams or use spatial reasoning to represent the relationships between elements.
*   **Work systematically:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and analyze each condition carefully.
*   **Be flexible:** Consider alternative arrangements and avoid getting fixated on one possibility.
*   **Check for hidden assumptions:** Ensure your reasoning is based on the given information and not on unstated assumptions.
*   **Practice:** Solve similar logic problems to improve your analytical skills and identify common pitfalls.
