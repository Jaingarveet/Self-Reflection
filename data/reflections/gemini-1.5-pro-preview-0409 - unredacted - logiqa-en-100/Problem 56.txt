## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I focused on finding an option that directly contradicted the expert's claim about the bridge hindering large ships. While option B did offer a counter-argument, it didn't directly address the feasibility of rebuilding the bridge. I failed to consider the possibility of technological solutions that could negate the need for demolition.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of question intent
*   Focus on contradiction rather than feasibility
*   Neglecting technological solutions
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the expert's claim:** The expert asserts that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge needs demolition and rebuilding to allow passage of giant ships, implying current limitations.
2.  **Evaluate each option's impact on the claim:**
    *   A: Highlights the economic impact of the bridge's limitations but doesn't address the need for rebuilding.
    *   B: Suggests most large ships don't pass the bridge, weakening the claim of it being a significant hindrance.
    *   C: Points out similar limitations in other bridges, suggesting a broader issue than just the Nanjing bridge.
    *   **D: Presents a technological solution (specially designed ships) that directly addresses the problem of large ships passing the bridge, raising the most doubt about the need for demolition.** 
3.  **Choose the option with the strongest counter-argument:** Option D provides the most compelling reason to doubt the expert's claim by demonstrating that technological advancements can overcome the bridge's limitations without demolition.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the core argument or claim being made.**
2.  **Analyze each option to understand how it relates to the core argument.**
3.  **Prioritize options that directly address the feasibility or necessity of the proposed action.**
4.  **Consider technological or alternative solutions that may challenge the initial assumption.**
5.  **Choose the option that raises the most doubt or provides the strongest counter-argument.**
## General Advice
*   **Think critically and consider multiple perspectives before forming a conclusion.**
*   **Be open to alternative solutions and technological advancements that can change the context of a problem.**
*   **Don't focus solely on finding contradictions; evaluate the strength and relevance of each counter-argument.**
*   **Practice active reading and comprehension to fully grasp the nuances of complex problems.**
