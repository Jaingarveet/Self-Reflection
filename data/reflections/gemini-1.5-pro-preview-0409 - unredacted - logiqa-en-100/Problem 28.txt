## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the "unless" condition. I assumed it meant "if F then M," but it actually implies "if not F then not M." This oversight led me to eliminate option D incorrectly.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Conditional statement misinterpretation
*   "Unless" statement misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **E or F, but not both:** Eliminates options with both (none) or neither (D remains).
2.  **J or K, but not both:** Eliminates options with both (none) or neither (A and D remain).
3.  **J then G:** This doesn't eliminate any remaining options.
4.  **Unless F, no M:** This means if F is NOT chosen, then M cannot be chosen. Option A has F, so it's still valid. However, option D does NOT have F, so it must also NOT have M. Since option D has M, it is invalid.
Therefore, the only remaining valid option is **A: F and H**.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  Carefully analyze each condition, paying close attention to keywords like "unless," "or," and "and."
2.  Break down complex conditions into simpler "if-then" statements.
3.  Consider each option and systematically eliminate those that violate any of the conditions.
4.  Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't misinterpreted any statements.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   Practice identifying different types of conditional statements and their logical implications.
*   Create truth tables or diagrams to visualize the relationships between conditions and outcomes.
*   Work through similar logic puzzles to improve your reasoning skills and identify common pitfalls.
*   Don't rush; take your time to carefully analyze each condition and its consequences.
