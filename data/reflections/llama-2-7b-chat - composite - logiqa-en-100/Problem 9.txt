Explanation:

The question asks which member of the two groups K can replace without violating any of the given conditions. To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem statement:

1. Each group has at least 3 employees.
2. [REDACTED] and K cannot be in the same group.
3. If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
4. M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
5. At least one of the same employees in both groups.

[REDACTED]rom condition 1, we know that the printing group has at least 3 employees, and the binding group has at least 3 employees.
[REDACTED]rom condition 2, we know that K cannot be in the same group as [REDACTED].
[REDACTED]rom condition 3, we know that if K is in the printing group, then J must also be in the printing group.
[REDACTED]rom condition 4, we know that M is at least one of the members of the printing group or the binding group.
[REDACTED]rom condition 5, we know that at least one of the same employees ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], J, or [REDACTED]) is in both groups.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) [REDACTED]: This option violates condition 2, as [REDACTED] and K cannot be in the same group.
B) [REDACTED]: This option violates condition 3, as [REDACTED] and J cannot be in the same group.
C) [REDACTED]: This option violates condition 4, as [REDACTED] is not one of the members of the printing group or the binding group.
D) [REDACTED]: This option violates condition 5, as [REDACTED] is not one of the members of both groups.

Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is:
