Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]

Here's why:

From the information provided, we know that:

* Zhang Shan received a higher bonus than Li Si.
* After learning that Wang Wu's bonus was higher than Miao Xiaoqin, Zhang Shan's bonus was also higher than Miao Xiaoqin.

So, if Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, then Zhang Shan's bonus must be higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, which is option (A).

Option (C) is incorrect because it states that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's, which is not true based on the information provided.

Option (B) is also incorrect because it states that Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's, which is not true based on the information provided.

Option (D) is not a valid option because it does not follow from the information provided.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]
