Explanation:
The argument relies on the fact that small-property houses are not protected by law, and therefore, the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

The argument assumes that all newly built houses in Hexi Village are small property houses, but this is not true. The argument does not take into account the possibility that some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village may not be small property houses. Therefore, the argument is weakened by the presence of non-small property houses in Hexi Village.

Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," does not weaken the argument as it does not affect the fact that small-property houses are not protected by law.

Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," is incorrect because the argument states that small-property houses are not protected by law, and therefore, the newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law regardless of whether it is a small property house or not.

Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," is incorrect because the argument does not rely on the location of the house but rather the legal status of small-property houses.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
