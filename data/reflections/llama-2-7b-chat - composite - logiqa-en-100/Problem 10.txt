Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED].

The passage states that the researchers divided the 51 middle school student volunteers into a test group and a control group, and that the test group received the same mathematics training. However, the passage does not provide any information about the initial mathematics scores of the two groups. Therefore, option (C) is the best supporting evidence for the researchers' views, as it suggests that the test group and control group had similar initial mathematics scores, which makes the improvement in the test group's mathematics ability more significant and meaningful.

The other options do not provide sufficient support for the researchers' views:

Option (A) is irrelevant, as the passage does not mention anything about the cost or pain associated with the stimulus.

Option (B) is incorrect, as the passage states that the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced after a slight electric shock, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations. This suggests that the effect of the micro-shocks on the brain's computing power is temporary and reversible, which contradicts the researchers' conclusion.

Option (D) is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about the subjects' behavior or concentration during the test.
