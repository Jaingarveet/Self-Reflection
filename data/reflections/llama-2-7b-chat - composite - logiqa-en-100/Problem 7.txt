Explanation:
The correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]

The statement suggests that the chemical is only present in the parts of the fish that seals eat, and not in the parts that people eat. This could explain why some people have not been poisoned after eating the contaminated fish, despite the fact that even small amounts of the chemical can poison mammals.

Here's why the other options are not correct:

* (A) The fish contaminated with this chemical has not been harmed by the chemical itself is not helpful in explaining the contradictions in the statement, as it does not address the reason why some people are not poisoned after eating the contaminated fish.
* (C) Traces of this chemical poison were also found in the bodies of some people who ate neither fish nor fish products is not relevant to the topic, as it does not explain why some people are not poisoned after eating the contaminated fish.
* (D) Fish contaminated with this chemical only accounts for a small portion of the seal's total food intake is not helpful in explaining the contradictions in the statement, as it does not address the reason why some people are not poisoned after eating the contaminated fish.

In conclusion, option (B) is the best explanation for the contradictions in the statement, as it suggests that the chemical is only present in the parts of the fish that seals eat, and not in the parts that people eat.
