Explanation:

The given statement describes the conditions for selecting five candidates from a group of six people. The conditions are:

1. At least one person of Bingding is selected: Since Bingding is one of the candidates, this condition is satisfied.
2. If E is selected, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are also selected: Since E is not selected, this condition is not satisfied.
3. [REDACTED] maximum of 2 people are selected: Since three people ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], and C) are selected, this condition is not satisfied.

Now, based on these conditions, we need to determine who is not in the fourth position.

Option [REDACTED] states that the person in the fourth position is [REDACTED]. However, since [REDACTED] is selected, this option is incorrect.

Option [REDACTED] states that the person in the fourth position is [REDACTED]. However, since [REDACTED] is not selected, this option is also incorrect.

Option [REDACTED] states that the person in the fourth position is [REDACTED]. However, since three people ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], and C) are selected, this option is incorrect.

Option [REDACTED] states that the person in the fourth position is [REDACTED] Since Ding is not a candidate, this option is the correct answer.

Therefore, the person who is not in the fourth position is [REDACTED]
