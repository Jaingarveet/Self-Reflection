Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

The argument being made in the passage is that the increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people is evidence that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating. However, the fact that the online forum is a legal forum weakens this argument because it suggests that the increase in these types of posts could be due to the increased number of people using the internet and participating in online discussions, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.

Option (B) [REDACTED], is also relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the increase in posts could be due to the increased number of people using the internet and participating in online discussions, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.

Option (A) [REDACTED], is a general statement that does not directly address the argument being made in the passage.

Option (C) In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes, is also relevant to the argument, as it suggests that the increase in posts could be due to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, rather than a genuine deterioration of the social atmosphere.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
