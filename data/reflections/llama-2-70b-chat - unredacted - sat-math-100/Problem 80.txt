  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the equation and wrote the wrong value for $k$.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Equation manipulation error
* Sign error

Solution:
We can solve this problem by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for $k$.

$$kx - 3y = 4$$
$$4x - 5y = 7$$

Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:

$$kx - 3y = 4 = 4x - 5y$$

Subtracting $4x$ from both sides gives us:

$$-3y = -5y$$

Therefore, $k = \frac{12}{5}$.

Instructions:

1. Set the two equations equal to each other.
2. Subtract $4x$ from both sides.
3. Solve for $k$.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always work through equations systematically and carefully.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Be mindful of signs and variables when solving equations.
* Use a step-by-step approach to solve problems.
