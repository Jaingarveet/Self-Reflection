  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the vertex of the parabola.
I correctly factored the quadratic equation, but I incorrectly found the vertex.
I mistakenly substituted $b = -8$ instead of $b = -2$.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Substitution error
- Quadratic equation error

Solution:
The given quadratic equation is:
$$y = a(x - 2)(x + 4) = a(x^2 - 8x + 8)$$
The vertex of the parabola is given by:
$$(c, d) = \left(\frac{-b}{2a}, \frac{-b^2}{4a}\right)$$
Here, $b = -2$ and $a$ is a nonzero constant.
Substituting the values, we get:
$$(c, d) = \left(\frac{2}{2}, \frac{(-2)^2}{4}\right) = (1, 4)$$
So, the vertex is $(1, 4)$.
Now, we can find $d$ as:
$$d = 4 = -9a$$
Therefore, $d = -9a$.

Instructions:

1. Factor the quadratic equation correctly.
2. Substitute the values of $b$ and $a$ correctly.
3. Calculate the vertex correctly.
4. Calculate $d$ correctly.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the vertex of a parabola can be found using the formula $(c, d) = \left(\frac{-b}{2a}, \frac{-b^2}{4a}\right)$.
