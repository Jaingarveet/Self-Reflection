  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. 
I incorrectly found the x-coordinate of the intersection point to be -1.695.
The correct x-coordinate is -0.5.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Substitution error
 - Simplification error
Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination.
By substitution, we have:
$$\begin{aligned}
2.4 x - 1.5 y &= 0.3 \\
1.6 x + 0.5 y &= -1.3
\end{aligned}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$2.4 x - 1.5(1.6 x + 0.5 y) = 0.3$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$2.4 x - 2.4 x - 0.8 y = 0.3$$
$$-0.8 y = -2.1$$
$$y = 2.625$$
Now, substituting $y = 2.625$ into one of the original equations, we get:
$$1.6 x + 0.5(2.625) = -1.3$$
$$1.6 x + 1.3125 = -1.3$$
$$1.6 x = -2.6125$$
$$x = -1.695$$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is -1.695.
Instructions:
1. Write the two equations in the system.
2. Substitute the second equation into the first equation.
3. Expand and simplify.
4. Solve for y.
5. Substitute y into one of the original equations.
6. Solve for x.
7. Find the x-coordinate of the intersection point.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is the value of $x$ that satisfies both equations in the system.
