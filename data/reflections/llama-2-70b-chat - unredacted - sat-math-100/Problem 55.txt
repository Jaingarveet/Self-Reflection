  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the nature of the parabola. 
I thought the parabola opened upwards, but it actually opens downwards. 
The minimum value of $y$ occurs at $x = 3$, not $x = -3$.
Error Keywords:
 - Misconception
 - Parabola
 - Minimum
Solution:
The given equation is a quadratic equation in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$.
The parabola opens downwards, meaning that the minimum value of $y$ occurs at $x = 3$.
The value of $y$ at $x = 3$ is $a$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the equation in the form $y = a x^2 + b x + c$.
2. Determine the nature of the parabola (opens upwards or downwards).
3. Identify the minimum value of $y$ and its corresponding $x$-coordinate.
4. Check your answer by plugging in the $x$-coordinate into the equation.
Advice:
 - Always graph the parabola to visualize its nature and identify its minimum or maximum.
 - Always double-check your answer by plugging in the $x$-coordinate into the equation.
 - Remember that the minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which can be found by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for $x$.
