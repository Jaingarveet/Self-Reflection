  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the problem and wrote the equation for the original price of the laptop incorrectly.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the problem
* Incorrect equation
* Calculation error

Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The laptop's discounted price = $p$
2. The amount Alma paid, including tax = $p$
3. The tax rate = 8%
4. The original price of the laptop = $p$ / (1 + 0.08)

Now, we can simplify the options:

A: $0.88p$ = ($1 - 0.20)($1 + 0.08)p = 0.88p

B: $\frac{p}{0.88}$ = $\frac{p}{1 - 0.20}$ = $\frac{p}{0.80}$

C: $(0.8)(1.08)p$ = $0.8p$ + $0.08p$ = $0.88p$

D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$ = $\frac{p}{0.80}$ = $\frac{p}{0.88}$

Therefore, the correct answer is D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$.
