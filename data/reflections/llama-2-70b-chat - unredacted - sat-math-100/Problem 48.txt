  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. 
I incorrectly substituted the expression for y into the first equation.
I misunderstood the relationship between the variables.
Error Keywords:
 - Substitution error
 - Calculation error
 - Variable confusion
Solution:
We are given two equations:

3x + b = 5x - 7
3y + c = 5y - 7

We can solve the first equation for x:

x = (5x - 7) / 3
x = 5x/3 - 7/3
x = 5(x/3) - 7/3

Now, we can substitute the expression for x into the second equation:

3(y/3) + c = 5(y/3) - 7/3
3y/3 + c = 5y/3 - 7/3
3y + c = 5y - 7/3

Now, we can solve for y:

y = (5y - 7/3) / 3
y = 5y/3 - 7/9
y = 5(y/3) - 7/9

Now, we can substitute the expression for y into the first equation:

3x + b = 5(y/3) - 7/9
3x + b = 5y/3 - 7/9

Now, we can see that b is equal to c minus 1/2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("A")

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that substition is a powerful tool for solving equations, but it is important to use it correctly.
