  Explanation:
I incorrectly solved the equation by factoring the left-hand side, which led me to consider only two possible cases. 
I missed the fact that the equation can be satisfied by other values of x as well.
Error Keywords:
 - Factoring error
 - Overlooked solutions
 - Incomplete analysis
Solution:
Rearranging the equation, we have:
$$x^2 - 1 = -2(x - 1)$$
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
$$x^2 - 1 = -2x + 2$$
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
$$x^2 - 3 = -2x$$
Now, we can factor the left-hand side:
$$(x - 1)(x + 3) = 0$$
So, we have three possible cases:
$$x - 1 = 0, x + 3 = 0, or x = 1$$
Solving for x, we get:
$$x = 1, x = -3, or x = 0$$
Therefore, the values of x that satisfy the equation are 1, -3, and 0.
Instructions:
1. Rearrange the equation to isolate x.
2. Expand the right-hand side of the equation.
3. Factor the left-hand side of the equation.
4. Solve for x in each possible case.
5. List all values of x that satisfy the equation.
Advice:
 - Always check your work by plugging in the solutions to the original equation.
 - Be thorough in your analysis and consider all possible cases.
 - Don't overlook simple solutions.
 - Use a systematic approach to solve equations.
 - Factoring is not always the best approach; consider other methods, such as using equations' properties or graphing.
