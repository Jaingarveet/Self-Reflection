  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the units of the variables and made a mistake in my calculation of the square root.

Error Keywords:

* Unit confusion
* Calculation error
* Square root error

Solution:
We can find when the ball will hit the ground by setting $h$ to zero and solving for $t$.
$h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$
$0=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$
$t^{2}=-25/4.9$
$t^{2}=5$
$t=sqrt(5)$
$t=2.5$

Instructions:

1. Set $h$ to zero.
2. Solve for $t$.
3. Calculate the square root of $5$.
4. Round up to the nearest whole number.

Advice:

* Always double-check your units to ensure they are consistent.
* Be careful when calculating square roots, especially when using a calculator.
* Always round up to the nearest whole number when approximating a solution.
* Take your time and work carefully through calculations to avoid simple mistakes.
