  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the unit of measurement for the slope.
The slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
In this case, the units of measurement for the slope are inches per year, since the height is measured in inches and the age is measured in years.
Therefore, the slope should be 3, not 7.8.

Error Keywords:

* Unit confusion
* Miscalculation
* Slope interpretation

Solution:
We are given the equation h = 3a + 28.6, which represents a linear function.
To find the estimated increase in height each year, we need to find the slope of the line.
The slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
In this case, we can choose any two values for a, such as a = 2 and a = 3.
Substituting a = 2 into the equation, we get h = 3(2) + 28.6 = 100.8.
Substituting a = 3 into the equation, we get h = 3(3) + 28.6 = 108.6.
Now we can calculate the slope:
Slope = (108.6 - 100.8) / (3 - 2) = 3
The slope tells us that the boy's height increases by 3 inches each year.

Instructions:

1. Identify the equation that represents the relationship between the boy's height and age.
2. Choose two values for the age, a, and substitute them into the equation to find the corresponding heights.
3. Calculate the slope of the line by finding the difference in heights and dividing it by the difference in ages.
4. Interpret the slope as the estimated increase in height each year.

Advice:

* Always pay attention to units when calculating and interpreting slopes.
* Make sure to choose appropriate values for the variables when finding the slope.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Use the equation to find the estimated increase in height for a specific age, rather than relying on the slope alone.
