  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is option D: I and II only.

The equation $$C = \frac{5}{9}(F-32)$$ shows that a temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Celsius. Therefore, option I is true.

Additionally, a temperature increase of 1 degree Celsius is equivalent to a temperature increase of 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, as we can see by rearranging the equation:

$$F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$$

Therefore, option II is also true.

Option III is false, as a temperature increase of $\frac{5}{9}$ degrees Fahrenheit is equivalent to a temperature increase of less than 1 degree Celsius.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D: I and II only.
