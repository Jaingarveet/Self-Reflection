  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my analysis of the given table. I incorrectly identified the slope of the line as -2, when in fact, it is -1.

Error Keywords:

* Slope
* Linear relationship
* Table analysis

Solution:
Let's re-analyze the given table:

| x | y |
| --- | --- |
| a | 0 |
| 3a | -a |
| 5a | -2a |

We can observe that the relationship between x and y is linear. We can write the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b.

From the table, we can see that the slope (m) is -1, as the ratio of the change in y to the change in x is -1.

Now, let's check the given options:

A: x + 2y = a

This equation cannot be true for any value of a, as the sum of x and 2y is always zero.

B: x + 2y = 5a

This equation is true for a = 1, as x = 3a and y = -a satisfy the equation.

C: 2x - y = -5a

This equation is true for a = 1, as x = 5a and y = -2a satisfy the equation.

D: 2x - y = 7a

This equation cannot be true for any value of a, as the left-hand side is always positive, while the right-hand side is always negative.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: x + 2y = a.

Instructions:

1. Carefully analyze the given table to identify the linear relationship between x and y.
2. Write the equation of the line in the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b.
3. Check the given options to find the correct equation that represents the relationship between x and y.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.
