  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by stating that none of the given choices matched the equation we derived.
However, upon reviewing the choices, I realized that choice A, $x^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=\frac{25}{9}$, is actually the correct equation.
I made a mistake in my calculation when simplifying the equation.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Simplification error
- Equation manipulation error
Solution:
We can start by using the formula for the equation of a circle: $(x-h)^{2} + (y-k)^{2} = r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
In this case, the center is $(0, 4)$ and the radius is half the length of the diameter, which is $\sqrt{\frac{41}{9}}$.
Therefore, the equation of the circle is:
$x^{2} + (y-4)^{2} = \frac{7^{2}}{9}$
Simplifying, we get:
$x^{2} + (y-4)^{2} = \frac{25}{9}$
Which matches choice A.
Instructions:
1. Use the formula for the equation of a circle.
2. Substitute the values for the center and radius.
3. Simplify the equation.
4. Compare the simplified equation with the given choices.
5. Choose the matching answer.
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations and simplifications.
- Make sure to compare the simplified equation with the given choices.
- Be careful when manipulating equations, especially when simplifying.
- Use the formula for the equation of a circle to ensure accuracy.
