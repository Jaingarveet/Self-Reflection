  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I isolated x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, but then I made a mistake in simplifying the equation.
I incorrectly substituted y = 100 into the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Substitution error
- Simplification error

Solution:
We can start by isolating x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, which results in 0.10x = 0.18(x+y) - 0.20y.
Next, we can substitute y = 100, as given in the question, and simplify to get 0.10x = 18 - 200.
Solving for x, we get x = 25.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Isolate x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation.
3. Substitute y = 100 into the equation.
4. Simplify the equation to solve for x.
5. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
