  Explanation:
My previous answer was incorrect because I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly added 9y to both sides of the equation, which led to a contradiction.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Substitution error
* Expansion error

Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we get x = -3y - 14. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

3(-3y - 14) - 2y = -6

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

-9y - 42 = -6

Adding 9y to both sides, we get:

-42 = -6

Therefore, the value of x - y is not defined, since we have a contradiction.

Instructions:

1. Solve the first equation for x.
2. Substitute the expression found in step 1 into the second equation.
3. Expand and simplify the equation.
4. Check for contradictions.
5. If there is no contradiction, solve for x - y.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Be careful when adding or subtracting equations, ensure that the operations are performed correctly.
* If a contradiction is found, check your work to find the mistake.
