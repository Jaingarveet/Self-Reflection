Solution: Given:
- [REDACTED] six-story office building housing six departments: Finance (F), Planning (P), Administration (A), Sales (S), Human Resources (HR), and Research & Development (R&D).
- Known information: 
    1. HR and Sales are not adjacent.
    2. Finance is one floor above Planning.
    3. Administration is above Planning but below HR.

Task: Determine which statement must be true if HR is not above Administration. 

Step-by-step:
1. From Known 2, Finance is above Planning, reducing the possible arrangements. 
2. Known 3 tells us that Administration is above Planning but not directly below HR, creating a gap. 
3. Known 1 tells us that Sales and HR are not adjacent, so they cannot occupy the two floors directly above Planning. 
4. This leaves two possible floors for Sales: above R&[REDACTED] or above Administration. 
5. If HR is not above Administration, it must be in the remaining spot above R&[REDACTED], placing Sales above Administration. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[REDACTED]: The Sales department is one level above the Administrative department. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Draw a visual representation of the building with six floors and label the departments. 
2. Use the known information to rule out impossible arrangements. 
3. Identify the constraints and their implications on the relative positions of the departments. 
4. Consider the statement: "HR is not above Administration." Interpret this as HR being either below or not directly above Administration. 
5. Apply this new constraint to the remaining possibilities from step 4. 
6. Choose the answer that aligns with the conclusion. 

Advice:
 - Create visual aids to help you understand spatial relationships. 
 - Break down complex constraints into their individual implications. 
 - Consider all possibilities and apply constraints systematically. 
 - Avoid making assumptions; work with the given information. 
 - Double-check your interpretations of the statements and constraints.
