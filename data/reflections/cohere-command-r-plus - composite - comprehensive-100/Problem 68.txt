Solution:
The line passes through the points (2, k) and (k, 32). For this line to also pass through the origin ([REDACTED], [REDACTED]), either the $x$ or $y$ coordinate of one of the given points must be zero. Setting $k=[REDACTED]$, we get the points (2, [REDACTED]) and ([REDACTED], 32). Thus, $k$ can be [REDACTED], and the correct answer is [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: Interpret the question correctly. Realize that the line passing through the origin means one of the given points must have a coordinate equal to zero. 
2. Check each given option: For each provided value of $k$, determine if it results in one of the points having a coordinate equal to zero. 
3. Choose the correct answer: Select the option that satisfies the condition for the line to pass through the origin. 

Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and understand the underlying mathematical concept. 
 - Interpret the problem correctly to avoid errors in reasoning. 
 - Always check each provided option systematically. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or overcomplicating the problem. 
 - Stay focused and avoid simple algebraic errors.
