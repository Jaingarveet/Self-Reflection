Explanation:
I misunderstood the scientific method's process. I thought that if the results did not match the hypothesis, the hypothesis should be changed immediately. However, the correct procedure is to [REDACTED] to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Scientific method
- Hypothesis testing
Solution:
In the scientific method, if the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, the next step is to [REDACTED] to ensure the results were not due to experimental error. Therefore, Michelle should [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and the situation presented.
2. Recall the steps of the scientific method.
3. Identify the current step in the scientific method based on the situation.
4. Determine the next step in the scientific method.
5. Choose the answer that matches the next step in the scientific method.
Advice:
- Always remember the steps of the scientific method.
- Understand that if results do not match the hypothesis, the investigation should be repeated to ensure the results were not due to experimental error.
- Only after repeated inconsistent results should the hypothesis be reconsidered.
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always think through each step of your reasoning.
