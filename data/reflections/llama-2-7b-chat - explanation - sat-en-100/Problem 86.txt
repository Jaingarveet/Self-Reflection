Explanation:
The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]

The passage initially focuses on the narrator's love of reading and how it was their only source of comfort and escape from their difficult childhood. However, as the passage progresses, the focus shifts to a specific incident that had a significant impact on the narrator's life: the gift of "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens from the bookshop owner, Sempere. This incident marks a turning point in the narrator's life, as it introduces them to a new author who becomes a lifelong friend and inspires them to pursue a career in writing.

The other options do not accurately reflect the shift in focus in the passage:

Option (B) depiction of the narrator's father does not play a significant role in the passage.

Option (C) symbolic representation of a skill the narrator possesses is not a main focus of the passage.

Option (D) tale about the hardships of the narrator's childhood is mentioned briefly, but the passage primarily focuses on the incident with Sempere and its impact on the narrator's life.
