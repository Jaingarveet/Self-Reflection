Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the question and applied an incorrect rule of natural selection. I assumed that the introduction of a predator would favor the traits of light wool and smaller size, leading to a decline in the dark-wool sheep population. However, the correct interpretation is that the presence of any predator, regardless of the specific traits it targets, will initially reduce the overall number of sheep, which are now easier prey. This results in a decrease in the population of light-wool sheep, as they were previously the dominant population on the island.

Solution: 
The question asks for the initial change in the sheep population following the introduction of a predator. The correct answer, B, reflects the understanding that the presence of any predator will first result in a decline in the overall number of sheep, which are now vulnerable to predation. This decrease will affect the more abundant light-wool sheep population first, as they are now more accessible to the predator. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the current conditions on Hirta: an abundance of grass and no natural sheep predators. 
2. Recognize the key fact: the increase in light-wool sheep over the last 20 years, indicating their dominance in the population. 
3. Interpret the impact of the new predator: it will make sheep easier prey, leading to a decrease in their overall population. 
4. Identify the initial change: a decline in the number of light-wool sheep, as they are now the majority and more available to the predator. 
5. Choose the answer reflecting this initial decrease in light-wool sheep. 

Advice: 
 - Read the question and choices carefully to identify the specific changes predicted by each answer. 
 - Understand the current ecological balance on the island and the factors influencing it. 
 - Recognize that the introduction of a new predator will initially make all sheep more vulnerable, leading to a general decline in their population. 
 - Avoid making assumptions about specific traits favored by the predator without explicit information. 
 - Consider the law of small numbers: a decline in the majority population will be more noticeable at first.
