Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
- Pay attention to the specific conditions and restrictions for each breed.
- Consider how the conditions and restrictions affect the possible combinations of kittens and puppies on different days.
- Use logical reasoning to identify the pair of days that cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.
