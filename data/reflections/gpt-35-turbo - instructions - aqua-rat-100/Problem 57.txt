Instructions:
1. Identify the radius of the circle.
2. Calculate the circumference of the circle.
3. Identify the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in the given time.
4. Multiply the circumference of the circle by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade.
5. Multiply the result by 2 because the point on the edge of the fan blade travels the circumference of the circle twice in one revolution.
6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
