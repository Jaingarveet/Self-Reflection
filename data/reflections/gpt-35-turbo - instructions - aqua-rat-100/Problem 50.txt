Instructions:
1. Identify the speeds of the ship and the plane.
2. Identify the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane.
3. Identify the distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship.
4. Write an equation that represents the total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet.
5. Write an equation that represents the distance traveled by the ship when they meet.
6. Write an equation that represents the distance traveled by the plane when they meet.
7. Solve the system of equations to find the time it takes for the plane and the ship to meet.
8. Substitute the time into the equation for the distance traveled by the ship to find the speed of the ship.
9. Substitute the time into the equation for the distance traveled by the plane to find the distance traveled by the plane when they meet.
10. Add the distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane to the distance traveled by the plane when they meet to find the distance from the starting point when they meet.
11. Check your calculations and final answer for accuracy.
