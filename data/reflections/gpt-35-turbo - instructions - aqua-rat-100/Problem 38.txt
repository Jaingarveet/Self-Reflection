Instructions:
1. Identify the dimensions of the outer cube and the inner cube.
2. Calculate the surface area of the outer cube.
3. Calculate the surface area of the inner cube.
4. Subtract the surface area of the inner cube from the surface area of the outer cube to find the surface area of the hollow cube.
5. Calculate the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface.
6. Multiply the number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface by 6 to find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes.
7. Subtract the number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the outer surface from the total number of faces of the smaller cubes to find the number of faces that remain unpainted.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
