Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that the test case strategy developed by Marshall was [REDACTED]. However, the passage does not explicitly state that the author views the strategy as [REDACTED]. Instead, the passage describes the strategy as "meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated" and "an essential element in the success of this tactic." The author also notes that the strategy was innovative and changed the landscape of public interest law. Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that the author views the test case strategy as [REDACTED].
