Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible locations of the optometrist, pharmacy, and veterinarian.
If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 3.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 4, then the toy store cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
However, I did not consider the fact that the optometrist could be in space 5, which would satisfy all of the constraints.
