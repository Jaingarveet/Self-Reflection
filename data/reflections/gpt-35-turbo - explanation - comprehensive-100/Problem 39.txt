Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] because the passage only mentions that horror stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are intended to produce dread in the reader, not all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature. 
The correct answer is option [REDACTED] because the passage states that some horror stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
