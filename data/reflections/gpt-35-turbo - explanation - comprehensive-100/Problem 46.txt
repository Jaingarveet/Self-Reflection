Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the purpose of the proverb rather than the author's purpose in providing a translation of the proverb. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in the content of the passage but in my ability to identify the author's purpose. 
I knew the proverb was used as a teaching tool to regulate peer-group relationships, but I did not connect that to the author's purpose in providing a translation of the proverb.
