Explanation:
I incorrectly chose [REDACTED] as the target that cannot be set for more than one client. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. 
The conditions state that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest cannot have [REDACTED] if Solide's website target is shorter.
