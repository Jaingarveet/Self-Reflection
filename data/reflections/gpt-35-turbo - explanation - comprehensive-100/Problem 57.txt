Explanation:
I misinterpreted the main idea of the passage. I focused on Lady Carlotta's decision to accept the job and her interactions with Mrs. Quabarl. However, the passage is primarily about Lady Carlotta's encounter with a struggling horse and her past experiences with interfering on behalf of distressed animals. The passage also briefly mentions Lady Carlotta's missed train and her acceptance of the governess job. Therefore, the best summary of the passage is that a woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.
