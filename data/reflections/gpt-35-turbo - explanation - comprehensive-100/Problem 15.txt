I chose option [REDACTED] because it suggests that the salamanders hide under rocks during the day, which could imply that they are not trampled by cattle and sheep. However, this does not necessarily contradict the experts' opinion that trampling is a significant factor in the decline of the salamander population. Option [REDACTED], on the other hand, suggests that a change in the environment, specifically a decrease in rainfall and groundwater levels, could be a significant factor in the decline of the salamander population. This would raise doubts about the experts' opinion that trampling is the primary cause of the decline.
