Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that the author would be likely to disagree with the statement that the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to fall if laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders are adopted. However, the passage does not provide any information about the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity. The passage discusses the economic principle of utility maximization and how it can be used to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime. The passage also suggests that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. The author would agree with all of the statements except for the statement that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases. The author would agree with the statement that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to increase if the access of individuals to economic institutions decreases.
