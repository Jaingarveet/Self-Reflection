Explanation:
I correctly calculated the speed of the space shuttle and the distance it covers in 5 seconds. However, I made an error in calculating the length of the space shuttle. I added the distance covered in 5 seconds to the distance traveled in 40 seconds instead of adding it to the length of the space shuttle.
