Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the robot types based on their behavior in the experiment. I incorrectly assumed that picking up the wrong objects meant the robots could recognize either color or shape, when in fact it could also mean they recognize neither.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incorrect assumptions
 - Incomplete consideration of possibilities
Solution:
1. Robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls. This could mean:
   a) It recognizes color (red) but not shape, so it is type A.
   b) It recognizes neither color nor shape, so it is type C.
2. Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls. This could mean:  
   a) It recognizes shape (balls) but not color, so it is type B.
   b) It recognizes neither color nor shape, so it is type C.
3. We can't definitively say which specific type (A, B, or C) each robot is. But we know:
   - No.1 is not type B, because it didn't recognize shape.
   - No.2 is not type A, because it didn't recognize color.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information.
2. Consider all possible explanations for each robot's behavior.
3. Eliminate robot types that are inconsistent with each robot's behavior.
4. Don't jump to conclusions; consider all possibilities before deciding.
5. Choose the answer that logically follows from the given information.
Advice:
 - Don't make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and explanations, even if some seem less likely.
 - Eliminate options that are provably false based on the given information. 
 - Be careful not to confuse what is possible with what is certain.
 - The correct answer will be true in all possible scenarios consistent with the problem statement.
