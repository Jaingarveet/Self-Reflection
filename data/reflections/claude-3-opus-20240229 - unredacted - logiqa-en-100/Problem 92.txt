Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that only one professor could be fully correct, one half correct, and one fully incorrect. However, I incorrectly concluded that Professor Qian's statement was the only one consistent with this constraint. In fact, Professor Sun's statement is the only one that fits.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Deductive reasoning error
 - Inconsistency in applying constraints
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
Let's reconsider the statements of each professor:
1. Professor Zhao: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team."
   - If true, this eliminates Tsinghua and Zhejiang, leaving China University of Science and Technology and Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics as possibilities.
2. Professor Qian: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China."
   - If true, this directly states that China University of Science and Technology is the champion.
3. Professor Sun: "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team."
   - If true, this directly states that Tsinghua University is the champion.
We know that only one professor is fully correct, one is half correct, and one is fully incorrect.
- If Professor Zhao is fully correct, then both Professor Qian and Professor Sun must be incorrect, which violates the constraint.
- If Professor Qian is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct and Professor Sun is fully incorrect. However, this is inconsistent because Professor Zhao's statement eliminates Tsinghua, contradicting Professor Qian.
- If Professor Sun is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct (correct about Zhejiang not being champion) and Professor Qian is fully incorrect. This is the only scenario that satisfies the constraints.
Therefore, the champion must be the Tsinghua University team.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand each professor's statement.
2. Consider the implications of each statement being true.
3. Identify the constraints given in the problem (one fully correct, one half correct, one fully incorrect).
4. Systematically consider each possibility of a professor being fully correct.
5. For each possibility, check if the other professors' accuracy is consistent with the constraints.
6. Eliminate possibilities that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
7. The remaining possibility that satisfies all constraints is the correct answer.
Advice:
 - In logic problems with multiple statements, consider each statement independently and its implications.
 - Clearly identify any constraints or conditions that must be satisfied.
 - Systematically consider all possibilities, eliminating those that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
 - Be rigorous in your reasoning and don't jump to conclusions prematurely.
 - If you get stuck, try working backwards from the constraints to see which possibilities they allow.
 - Practice breaking down complex problems into clear, step-by-step reasoning.
