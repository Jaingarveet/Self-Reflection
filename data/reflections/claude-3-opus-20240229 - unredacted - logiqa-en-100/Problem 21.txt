Explanation:
Upon further reflection, I realize I misinterpreted the question and Xiao Wang's rebuttal. The question asks about the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen, not the content of the rebuttal itself.
Xiao Wang did not directly disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or provide an alternative explanation. Rather, Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument lacked persuasion and jumped to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Just because people don't normally observe distant comets flickering doesn't necessarily mean this instance is unusual - it could simply be due to lack of continuous, careful observation in the past.
Error Keywords:
 - Question misinterpretation 
 - Focusing on argument content vs. argument method
 - Insufficient question analysis
Solution:
Xiao Chen argues that since the flickering of Comet 1996D3 far from the sun has not been observed before, it must be an unusual occurrence. 
Xiao Wang counters by saying that people don't normally observe distant comets, and this flickering was only discovered through continuous, careful tracking. 
Xiao Wang is pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument jumps to a conclusion and lacks persuasion. Just because something hasn't been observed before doesn't mean it's necessarily unusual - it could simply be due to lack of sufficient observation in the past.
Therefore, Xiao Wang's refutation focuses on exposing the weakness and lack of persuasion in Xiao Chen's line of reasoning, not on providing an alternative explanation.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully, focusing on exactly what is being asked.
2. Identify the key claims and conclusions made by each person. 
3. Analyze how the second person is responding to the first person's argument.
4. Determine if the response is addressing the content of the argument or the method/logic of the argument.
5. Select the answer choice that best describes the method of refutation used, not the content of the refutation.
Advice:
 - Always read questions carefully and make sure you understand exactly what is being asked before attempting to answer.
 - In logic questions about arguments, differentiate between the content of an argument and the method/structure of an argument.
 - When someone refutes an argument, identify if they are attacking the conclusion, the premises, or the overall logic and persuasiveness of the argument.
 - Eliminate answer choices that do not fit the refutation method used, even if they seem somewhat relevant to the argument's content.
 - If you find yourself focusing too much on the details of the arguments, take a step back and look at the big picture of how the arguments interact.
