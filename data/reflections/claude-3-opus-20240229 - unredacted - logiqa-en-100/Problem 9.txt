Explanation:
I incorrectly concluded that K could only replace H without violating any conditions. However, upon further reflection, I realize that K can also replace G in the binding group without violating any conditions. I failed to consider this possibility in my initial analysis.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooked valid solution
 - Hasty conclusion
Solution:
1. The printing group consists of F, H, L, and M.
2. The binding group consists of G, H, and J.
3. K cannot replace F in the printing group because condition (2) states that F and K cannot be in the same group.
4. K can replace G in the binding group. This would not violate any conditions:
   - Each group would still have at least 3 employees (condition 1).
   - F and K would be in different groups (condition 2).
   - If K replaces G in the binding group, J is also in that group (condition 3).
   - M would still be in at least one group (condition 4).
   - There would still be at least one common employee (H) in both groups (condition 5).
5. K can replace H in either the printing group or the binding group, as explained in my initial response.
6. K cannot replace L in the printing group because then there would be no common employee in both groups, violating condition (5).
Therefore, K can replace either G in the binding group or H in either group without violating any conditions.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all the given conditions.
2. Identify the current members of each group.
3. For each answer choice, consider whether replacing that member with K would violate any of the given conditions.
4. If replacing a member with K does not violate any conditions, that is a valid answer.
5. Consider all possibilities before drawing a conclusion.
6. Choose the answer that represents a member that can be replaced by K without violating any conditions.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all given conditions or constraints.
 - Consider each answer choice systematically and thoroughly.
 - Think through the implications of each potential change to the groups.
 - Don't jump to conclusions; consider all possibilities before deciding.
 - If multiple answers seem valid, re-check each one to confirm they don't violate any conditions.
 - In logic problems, a single overlooked detail can lead to an incorrect answer.
