Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the imaging modalities and their indications. I thought that [REDACTED] scan was the most appropriate choice, but I failed to consider the fact that [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is more commonly used as a first-line imaging modality for pyloric stenosis.
