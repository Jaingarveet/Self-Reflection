Explanation:
I incorrectly diagnosed the patient with [REDACTED].
The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are actually consistent with [REDACTED].
I was not familiar with the term "[REDACTED]" and mistakenly thought it was a type of granuloma that could cause nasal obstruction and discharge.
I was also not familiar with the term "[REDACTED]" and its association with nasal symptoms.
