Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the term "senescent RBCs" and thought it referred to a specific type of red blood cell that is more susceptible to attack by malaria parasites. However, "senescent RBCs" actually refers to red blood cells that are near the end of their lifespan and are more prone to being attacked by the immune system.
