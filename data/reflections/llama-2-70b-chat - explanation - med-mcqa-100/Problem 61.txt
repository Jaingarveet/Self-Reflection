Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the most common type of seizure in newborns with the most common type of seizure in older children and adults, which is tonic-clonic seizures. However, newborns have a different pattern of seizure activity, and the most common type of seizure in this age group is actually subtle seizures.
