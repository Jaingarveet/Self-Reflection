Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the reason why bicarbonate buffers are ideal in blood. I thought it was because they are a weak acid and weak base combination, which allows them to effectively maintain pH homeostasis in the body. However, the correct reason is that bicarbonate buffers have a high concentration in blood, which makes them effective at maintaining pH homeostasis.
