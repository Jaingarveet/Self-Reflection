Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the characteristics of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] anesthesia. I thought that [REDACTED] anesthesia was the stage where the patient becomes hyperactive, but it is actually [REDACTED] anesthesia where the patient may exhibit signs of increased muscle tone or tremors.
