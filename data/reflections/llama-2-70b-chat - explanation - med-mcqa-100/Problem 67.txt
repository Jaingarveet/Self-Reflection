Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the complications of a different surgical procedure, cystojejunostomy, with the complications of cystogastrostomy. Cystojejunostomy is a procedure that creates a connection between a pancreatic cyst and the small intestine, and one of its major complications is the development of a fistula.
