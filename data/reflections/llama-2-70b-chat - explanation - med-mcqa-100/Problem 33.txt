Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the target antigen in cicatricial pemphigoid.
I mistakenly believed that the autoantibodies in the patient's serum would bind to epiligrin (BP180) on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique, which is the most common antigen targeted by IgG autoantibodies in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid.
However, the correct answer is [REDACTED] (A), which is also known as collagen type XVII.
XVI collagen is a component of the basement membrane zone that is targeted by autoantibodies in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid.
