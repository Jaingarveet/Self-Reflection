Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between keratoderma blenorrhagica and psoriasis.
I knew that keratoderma blenorrhagica is a condition that affects people with psoriasis, but I mistakenly thought it was a symptom of psoriatic arthritis, rather than reactive arthritis.
