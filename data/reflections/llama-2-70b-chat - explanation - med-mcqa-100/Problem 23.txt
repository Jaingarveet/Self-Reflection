Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the term "expansile type osseous metastases." I thought it referred to a type of bone metastasis that was typically associated with breast cancer. However, expansile type osseous metastases actually refer to a type of bone metastasis that is typically associated with primary malignancies that have a high propensity for bone metastasis, such as renal cell carcinoma.
