Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the treatment approach for post-radiation skin lesions. I thought that topical agents like petroleum jellies would be effective in promoting wound healing and reducing inflammation. However, the correct approach is observation alone, as the lesions typically resolve on their own without intervention.
