I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the mechanism of action of benzoyl peroxide. I thought it was effective in treating comedonal acne by reducing P. acnes bacteria and helping to unclog pores, but it actually works by reducing the amount of P. acnes bacteria and also reducing inflammation.
