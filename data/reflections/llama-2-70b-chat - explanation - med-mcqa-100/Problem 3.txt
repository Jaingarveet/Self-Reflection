Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the properties of polysulfide impression material with those of polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impression material. While polysulfide is indeed elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and is catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid, PVS is also elastic and sets by a chemical reaction, but it is not catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid.
