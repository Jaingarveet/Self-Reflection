Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question [REDACTED]ecause I confused the types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions. Spring catarrh is [REDACTED]tually a type of type II hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity. In this re[REDACTED]tion, the immune system produces anti[REDACTED]odies that target and destroy cells that have taken up the allergen, in this case, pollen.
