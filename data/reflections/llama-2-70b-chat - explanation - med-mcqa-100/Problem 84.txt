Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the mechanism of action of [REDACTED] with that of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
I knew that [REDACTED] increases the outflow of aqueous humor, but I mistakenly thought it did so by reducing the production of aqueous humor, like the other three medications.
In reality, [REDACTED] works by increasing the permeability of the trabecular meshwork, allowing more aqueous humor to flow out of the eye.
