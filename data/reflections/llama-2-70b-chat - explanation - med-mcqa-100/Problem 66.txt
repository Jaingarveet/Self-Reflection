Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the duration of Hepatitis [REDACTED] virus shedding in faeces.
The gap in my knowledge was in the exact timeline of the virus shedding.
I knew that the virus was shed in faeces before and after symptoms appear but I was not sure for how long.
