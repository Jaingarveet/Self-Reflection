Advice:
 - Always read the question and conditions carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the conditions.
 - Always double-check your analysis and final answer.
 - Remember that conditions may not specify when something must happen, only that it must happen at some point.
