  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D, "Not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival."

The given statements imply that there is a strong correlation between the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and those that won prizes at international film festivals. However, this correlation does not necessarily imply that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because it states that most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to support this claim.

Option B is incorrect because it states that most of the Canadian films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. However, the given statements only mention that the films shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival are Canadian, not that all Canadian films were shown at the festival.

Option C is incorrect because it states that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films. While this may be true, it does not provide any information about the relationship between the films that won prizes at the two types of festivals.

Option E is incorrect because it states that at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This statement is possible, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the films that won prizes at the two types of festivals.
