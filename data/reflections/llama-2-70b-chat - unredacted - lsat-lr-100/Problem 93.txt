  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The correct answer is E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. The passage states that Ellsworth is self-righteous and offended by suggestions of unethical business practices. It is reasonable to assume that people who know Ellsworth expect him to be easily offended, given his self-righteous nature. This expectation does not necessarily imply that Ellsworth is engaged in unethical practices, but it does suggest that his offense may be a result of his self-righteousness rather than any actual wrongdoing.
