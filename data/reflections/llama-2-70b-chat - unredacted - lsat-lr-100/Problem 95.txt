  Action: Answer("A")

The argument states that retailers don't need to excel in both convenience and variety to be successful, citing examples of successful retailers who excel in only one of those areas. This is parallel to choice A, which states that long-distance champions don't need to have both above-average speed and endurance, citing examples of champions who win by excelling in only one of those aspects.

The other choices don't present the same parallel structure:

B: This choice presents a different scenario where success in a long-distance race can be achieved by excelling in either speed or endurance, but not necessarily both. However, it doesn't address the idea that average performance in one area can be compensated by excellence in another.

C: This choice presents a scenario where excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not necessary to win a race, but it doesn't provide an example of individuals who succeed despite only excelling in one area.

D: This choice presents a scenario where apples that are neither firm nor flavorful are unsuitable for baking, but it doesn't provide an example of individuals who succeed despite only excelling in one area.

E: This choice presents a scenario where some plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are still useful, but it doesn't provide an example of individuals who succeed despite only excelling in one area.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
