  Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The correct answer is E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.

The information provided states that the rate of cabin air replenishment has decreased since 1985, resulting in higher levels of carbon dioxide in the cabin air and making it easier for airborne illnesses to spread. This implies that the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight in 1980, when the cabin air was replenished more frequently, was lower than it is today on a similar flight. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.
