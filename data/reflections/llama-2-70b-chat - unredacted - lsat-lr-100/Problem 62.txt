  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the nuance of the disagreement between Peter and Yoko. I thought they were disagreeing over whether children's stories should be less frightening, when in fact they were disagreeing over whether children's stories still have clearly immoral characters.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the question
* Misinterpreting the disagreement
* Not carefully reading the choices

Solution:
Peter believes that children's stories should have clearly immoral characters to teach children the consequences of being bad. Yoko, on the other hand, believes that children's stories still have immoral characters, but they are not as frightening as they used to be, which is an improvement.

The correct answer is D, as Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories tend to have clearly immoral characters in them.
