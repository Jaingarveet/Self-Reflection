  Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
The passage states that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, despite being hunted for food by Native peoples in North America. This suggests that the population of northern fur seals remained relatively stable during that time, and therefore, hunting by Native peoples did not significantly reduce the population of northern fur seals. This supports choice E, "Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied."
