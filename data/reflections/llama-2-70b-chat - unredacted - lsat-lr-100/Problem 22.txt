  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The correct answer is A: A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.

This answer choice weakens the argument that Grey read Jordan's book because it suggests that the metaphor was not unique to Jordan's book and that both authors may have obtained it from the same source. This shared source could be the text published in 1860, which both Jordan and Grey may have read. Therefore, the fact that Grey uses the same metaphor as Jordan does not necessarily mean that he read her book.

Error Keywords:

* Coincidence
* Shared source
* Independent creation

Solution:
1. Identify the unusual metaphor used in both Jordan's and Grey's books.
2. Look for other sources that may have contained the same metaphor.
3. Determine if the idea expressed in Grey's book using the metaphor is related to the ideas in Jordan's book.
4. Consider the possibility that both authors may have obtained the metaphor from the same source.
5. Evaluate the strength of the argument that Grey read Jordan's book based on the evidence.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify the metaphor in question.
2. Research the publication dates and contents of relevant texts.
3. Analyze the ideas expressed in both Jordan's and Grey's books.
4. Consider alternative explanations for the similarity in metaphors.
5. Evaluate the strength of the argument based on the evidence.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the argument and identify the key elements.
* Research the relevant facts and evidence.
* Consider alternative explanations and evaluate their plausibility.
* Evaluate the strength of the argument based on the evidence.
* Be open to revising your initial conclusion based on new information or perspectives.
