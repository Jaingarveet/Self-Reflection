  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct answer is choice B: There is as yet little reason to accept that birds have an innate homing sense.

The argument states that there is little evidence to support the belief that migratory birds have an innate homing sense, and that the studies testing this belief are inconclusive. Therefore, the main conclusion drawn in the argument is that there is currently no sufficient reason to accept that birds have an innate homing sense.

Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not address whether humans have an innate homing sense.

Choice C is incorrect because while the argument states that studies are inconclusive, it does not conclude that they are probably not an innate ability.

Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not address whether the ability to use landmarks to find one's way home is an innate ability in birds.

Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not compare humans' sense of direction to birds' homing sense.

Therefore, the best answer is choice B: There is as yet little reason to accept that birds have an innate homing sense.
