  Action: Answer(E)

The mayor's argument presents a false dichotomy by limiting the options to only two: adopting the mayor's plan to build a new expressway or doing nothing. This ignores the possibility of other solutions, such as improving public transportation, investing in alternative modes of transportation, or implementing traffic management strategies. By neglecting to consider these alternatives, the argument fails to provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of increasing traffic. Therefore, option E is the best answer.
