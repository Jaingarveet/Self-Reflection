  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct answer is option B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.

The study aims to compare the memory abilities of Group A (people aged 65-75) and Group B (college students). The conclusion is that Group A is better at remembering to make a phone call at a specified time than Group B.

Option B is helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn because it ensures that the data collection process was consistent across both groups. If different researchers had answered the calls, there could have been variations in the way the calls were answered, which could have affected the results. By having the same group of researchers answer the calls, we can minimize any potential bias and ensure that the data collected is reliable.

Option A, C, and E also provide important information that supports the conclusion, but they are not as directly relevant to the data collection process as option B. Option A ensures that the sample size was the same for both groups, which helps to minimize any potential bias. Option C ensures that there were no older individuals in Group B, which helps to isolate the effect of aging on memory. Option E ensures that both groups received their instructions at approximately the same time, which helps to minimize any potential confounding variables related to the timing of the instructions.

Option D, on the other hand, does not provide any information that would affect the conclusion. Even if both groups had equal access to phones, it does not necessarily mean that the difference in memory abilities between the two groups can be attributed to age. Other factors such as lifestyle, habits, and individual differences could still be at play.

Therefore, option B is the most helpful in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn.
