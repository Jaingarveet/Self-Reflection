  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it.

The argument assumes that the press has an obligation to publish any story of interest to the public, simply because they have the right to do so. However, this does not necessarily follow. Just because the press has the right to publish a story, it does not mean that they are obligated to do so. The press may choose to exercise their right to publish, or they may choose not to, depending on various factors such as ethical considerations, public interest, and the potential impact on private individuals. Therefore, choice "B" is the best answer.
