  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The argument requires the assumption that an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting. The argument states that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting, and the difference between hot and cold composting is a fundamental aspect of composting. Therefore, Choice C is the best answer.

Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not assume that some gardening books that recommend tilling the soil and adding compost are not flawed. Instead, the argument suggests that any book that recommends adding compost without explaining the basics of composting is flawed.

Choice B is also incorrect because the argument does not assume that gardeners should not add compost to the soil unless they have a thorough understanding of composting. While it may be ideal for gardeners to have a thorough understanding of composting, the argument only requires that gardening books that recommend adding compost explain the basics of composting.

Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not assume that everyone who understands the difference between hot and cold composting understands at least the basics of composting. While understanding the difference between hot and cold composting is an important aspect of composting, it is not necessarily a guarantee that a person understands all the basics of composting.

Choice E is incorrect because the argument does not assume that no gardening book that includes an explanation of at least the basics of composting is flawed. While it may be true that a book that includes an explanation of the basics of composting is less likely to be flawed, the argument only asserts that a book that recommends adding compost without explaining the basics of composting is flawed.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
