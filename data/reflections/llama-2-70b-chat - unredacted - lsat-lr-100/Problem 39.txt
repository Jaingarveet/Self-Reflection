  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the nature of Rossi's argument. I thought that Rossi's argument was based on the predictable consequences of a proposal, specifically the impact of governmental deficits on future generations. However, Rossi's argument actually appeals to a general principle of democracy, that people should have the right to vote and have their interests represented in government.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the argument
* Failure to recognize the appeal to a general principle

Solution:
Rossi's argument is based on the principle of democracy, which holds that people should have the right to vote and have their interests represented in government. This principle applies to children as well as adults, as children's interests are not always represented by their parents. Therefore, option A is the best choice.
