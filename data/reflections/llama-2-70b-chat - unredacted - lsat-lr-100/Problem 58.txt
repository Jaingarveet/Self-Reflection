  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The correct answer is choice B: New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.

The argument states that the macaques' behavior of entering the hot spring was not observed before 1963, but became adopted by the entire troop by 1990. This suggests that the behavior was not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. Therefore, choice B is the best answer.

The other choices are not necessarily related to the argument:

* A: Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades. This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not mention genetic mutations.
* C: Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species. This statement is also not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not mention genetic alterations or typical behaviors.
* D: The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage. This statement is false, as social behaviors are influenced by genetics to some extent. However, the argument does not rely on this assumption.
* E: The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations. This statement is not necessarily true, as the argument only mentions that the behavior was adopted by the entire troop by 1990, without specifying whether it will persist over several generations.

Therefore, the best answer is choice B.
