  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The passage states that both horror stories about monstrous beasts and mad scientists describe violations of the laws of nature and are intended to produce dread in the reader. However, it does not necessarily follow that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.

The correct answer is E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

The passage mentions that horror stories about monstrous beasts typically symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist, and that horror stories about mad scientists often express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. This suggests that symbolism is used in horror stories to convey deeper meanings and themes, and that violations of the laws of nature may be used as a tool to create a sense of dread or unease in the reader.

Therefore, option E is the best answer, as it acknowledges that violations of the laws of nature may be used in horror stories that employ symbolism, but does not necessarily imply that all stories that describe such violations are intended to produce dread.
