  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the question and the given answer, I realize that my initial response was incorrect.

The correct answer is indeed D: After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.

This answer choice aligns with the principle illustrated by the argument, where despite Kuttner's admission of wrongdoing, the conservation officer cannot take punitive measures due to their own wrongdoing (trespassing). Similarly, in the original argument, the company cannot take punitive measures against Ellison due to their own wrongdoing (illegally recording conversations).

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this clears up any confusion.
