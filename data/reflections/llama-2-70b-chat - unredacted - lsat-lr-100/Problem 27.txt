  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The correct answer is A: The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.

The explanation for why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged despite the discovery of 40 billion more galaxies is that the mass of galaxies is only a small fraction of the universe's total mass. This means that even though the number of galaxies has increased, their total mass is still a small percentage of the universe's total mass, and therefore, the estimates of the universe's total mass remain largely unchanged.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the question
* Failure to consider all possible answers
* Incorrect assumption about the impact of new evidence on estimates of the universe's total mass

Solution:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the context.
2. Consider all possible answers and their implications.
3. Evaluate the impact of new evidence on estimates of the universe's total mass.
4. Choose the answer that best explains why the estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged.

Instructions:

1. Identify the correct answer choice.
2. Explain the reasoning behind the correct answer.
3. Identify any error keywords that may have contributed to the incorrect answer.
