Explanation:
I made a mistake in interpreting condition (3). "If X is allocated to the sales department, W is allocated to the production department" does not mean that X and W must be in different departments, as I initially assumed. Instead, it means that if X is in sales, then W will be in production, but it does not restrict their allocation if X is not in sales.
