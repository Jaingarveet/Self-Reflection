Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conditions and made an incorrect inference about the relationship between papers G and K. I overlooked the fact that statement 3 tells us that if paper G is not used, then paper K is also not needed, but it does not imply the reverse. Therefore, statement [REDACTED] is not correct.
