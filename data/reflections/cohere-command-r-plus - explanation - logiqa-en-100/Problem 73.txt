Explanation:
I misinterpreted condition (2) to mean that K must always be in the middle position, but this condition is only valid if K is chosen to play. 
I overlooked the possibility that K might not be selected at all, which would render this condition irrelevant. 
Additionally, I incorrectly assumed that N and Q could not be in Team 1 due to conditions (1) and (6), but these conditions pertain specifically to their positions on Team 2.
