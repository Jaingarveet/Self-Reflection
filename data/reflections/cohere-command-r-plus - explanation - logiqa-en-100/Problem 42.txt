Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and chose an answer that contradicted the argument's timeline, rather than its main conclusion. I focused on the date of the cave's inhabitation, ignoring the key point about the number of inhabitants. The correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], refutes the argument's conclusion by suggesting an alternative explanation for the presence of artifacts without disputing the timeline.
