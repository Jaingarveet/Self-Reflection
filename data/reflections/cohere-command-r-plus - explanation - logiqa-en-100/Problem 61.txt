Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition "There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time." I overlooked the fact that this condition referred to a single individual and instead interpreted it as a restriction on the overall arrangement, leading me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED].
