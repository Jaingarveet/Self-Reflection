Explanation:
I misinterpreted condition (3) and made an error in assigning W to the sales department. 
The correct interpretation of condition (3) is that if X is in sales, then W must be in production, not sales. 
This changes the department allocation for W and subsequently impacts the conclusion about G's department.
