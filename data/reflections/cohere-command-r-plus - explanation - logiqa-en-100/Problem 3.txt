Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition in the context. I overlooked the phrase "you have to know that you are great in one thing." This phrase indicates a necessary condition, not a sufficient condition. My error was in assuming that excellence in one area guarantees success, when in fact it is presented as a prerequisite for even entering the market competition.
