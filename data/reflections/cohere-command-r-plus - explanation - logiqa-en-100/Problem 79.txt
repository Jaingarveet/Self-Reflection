Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of "rebuttal" and "doubt" in the context of the question. 
I focused too narrowly on the concept of "visual experience" and its reliability, rather than considering the broader argument about the existence of an external world and the role of natural science in supporting or refuting this claim.
