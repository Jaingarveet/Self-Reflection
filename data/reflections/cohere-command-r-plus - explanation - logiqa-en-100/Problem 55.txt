Explanation:
I misinterpreted some of the conditions and made assumptions that led me to choose the incorrect answer. 
I incorrectly assumed that conditions (4) and (5) meant that P and N, and P and Q, could not be on the same team, respectively, when in fact, these conditions state that they "cannot be in the same team as" each other. 
This misunderstanding led me to place P on the second team, when in fact, P should not be on the same team as K or Q.
