Explanation:
Upon re-reading the paragraph, I realize that my initial interpretation was incorrect. The paragraph is not primarily questioning Akira's suggestion, but rather analyzing Chie's reaction to it.
The key phrases are "Was that it?" and "would Chie have been more receptive?" which indicate that the paragraph is focused on understanding Chie's reaction, and whether it would have been different if Akira had followed tradition.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of main purpose
- Focus on minor detail (questioning suggestion) instead of main idea (analyzing reaction)
- Insufficient attention to key phrases indicating main purpose
Corrected Solution:
The first paragraph is mainly focused on analyzing Chie's reaction to Akira's direct approach. It questions whether her reaction would have been more positive if Akira had followed the traditional form of using a go-between to make his proposal, instead of coming directly to her. The paragraph suggests that breaking tradition might have been the reason for Chie's negative reaction.
