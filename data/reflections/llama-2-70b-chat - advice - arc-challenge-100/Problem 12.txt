Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the terms used.
* Make sure you understand the properties of matter and their differences in different states.
* Double-check your answer by reviewing the properties of the samples in question.
* Remember that a sample can refer to a small portion of a substance, not necessarily the number of atoms it contains.
