Solution:
The first passage discusses the role of defense lawyers and their obligation to the court and society.
The second passage discusses the relationship between the information in the first passage and the information in the sentence at lines 7-11.
The sentence at lines 7-11 states that lawyers should not present to the court assertions that they know to be false.
The second passage states that the information in the first passage does not support the statement at lines 7-11.
The second passage argues that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
This contradicts the statement at lines 7-11, which suggests that lawyers should always present the best defense possible, regardless of their personal beliefs about their client's guilt or innocence.
