Solution:
The passage discusses two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding and the criticisms of each proposal.
The first proposal advocates teaching about other cultures within the context of the majority culture, while the second proposal advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
Critics of the first proposal argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
Critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden and that insisting on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
The main point of the passage is that critics of two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding claim these proposals are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system.
