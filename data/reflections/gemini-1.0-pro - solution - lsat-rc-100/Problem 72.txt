Solution:
The passage states that high lipid levels are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease.
The passage does not state that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness.
The passage states that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness.
The passage does not provide evidence to support the statement that greater platelet adhesiveness increases the risk of premature heart disease.
