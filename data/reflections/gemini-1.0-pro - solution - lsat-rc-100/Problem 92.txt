Solution:
The passage criticizes the second version of multicultural education for using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures, arguing that these methods are incompatible with the values and perspectives of non-Western cultures.
Option [REDACTED] directly addresses this criticism by stating that adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture requires being a member of that culture. This suggests that genuine understanding of a non-Western culture can only be achieved through immersion and lived experience within that culture, rather than through the application of external methods.
