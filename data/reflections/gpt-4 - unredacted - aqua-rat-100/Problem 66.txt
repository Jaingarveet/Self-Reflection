Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the equation. I incorrectly calculated the value of n (number of members) from the equation. This is a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Equation solving error
Solution:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: 
Sum = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d) 
where n is the number of terms (members in this case), a is the first term (age of the youngest member), and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 
250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25)
Solving this equation will give us the number of members in the club.
Rearranging the equation gives:
n^2 + 4n - 2000 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation gives n = 25 or n = -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is 25.
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and identify the given values.
2. Write down the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
3. Substitute the given values into the formula.
4. Solve the resulting equation to find the number of terms (members).
5. Check the solution to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations.
- Be careful when solving equations, especially quadratic equations.
- Remember that the solution must make sense in the context of the problem. In this case, the number of members cannot be negative.
