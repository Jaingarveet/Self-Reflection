Solution: Solving the system of equations step by step: 

$\begin{array}{r}
3x + 4y = -23 \quad \cdot2 \\
6x + 8y = -46 \\
\end{array}$

$\begin{array}{r}
2y - x = -19 \quad \cdot4 \\
8y - 4x = -76 \\
\end{array}$

Adding the two equations eliminates $y$:
$6x + 8y + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$
$14y = -122$
$y = -\frac{122}{14} = -8.71$ (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, plug $y$ into one of the original equations to find $x$:
$3x + 4y = -23$
$3x + 4(-8.71) = -23$
$3x - 34.84 = -23$
$3x = 11.84$
$x = \frac{11.84}{3} \approx 3.95$ (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the solution is $(x, y) \approx (3.95, -8.71)$, which is closest to choice **B**.
