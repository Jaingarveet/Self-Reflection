Solution: The passage states that Seydel did not plant crops to avoid competition with weeds. This suggests that the presence of crops would have provided additional competition and potentially reduced the weed coverage. Therefore, if Seydel had planted wheat or corn, the percentage of weed coverage would likely have been lower than what Hartmann observed without any crops.
