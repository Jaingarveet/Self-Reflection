Solution: Given:
- [REDACTED] six-story office building housing six departments: Finance (F), Planning (P), Administration (A), Sales (S), Human Resources (HR), and Research & Development (R&D).
- Known information: 
    1. HR and Sales are not adjacent.
    2. Finance is one floor above Planning.
    3. Administration is above Planning but below HR.

Task: Determine which statement must be true if HR is not above Administration. 

Step-by-step:
1. From Known 2, Finance is above Planning, reducing the possible arrangements. 
2. Known 3 tells us that Administration is above Planning but not directly below HR, creating a gap. 
3. Known 1 tells us that Sales and HR are not adjacent, so they cannot occupy the two floors directly above Planning. 
4. This leaves two possible floors for Sales: above R&[REDACTED] or above Administration. 
5. If HR is not above Administration, it must be in the remaining spot above R&[REDACTED], placing Sales above Administration. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[REDACTED]: The Sales department is one level above the Administrative department.
