Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking.
- Pay attention to the scope of the topics covered in each passage, not just the tone or certainty of the claims made.
- When comparing two passages, consider all aspects of their content, including the breadth of the topics they cover.
- Don't rush your answer. Take the time to fully understand the question and the passages before making your choice.
