  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The author's primary aim in the passage is to illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress. The passage explains how scientists overlooked the possibility of nuclear fission despite amassing evidence that suggested it was possible. The author highlights how the scientific community's understanding of nuclear fission developed gradually and unexpectedly, with researchers initially misunderstanding the results of their experiments.

The passage does not criticize a traditional view of scientific progress (choice A), judge the relative importance of theory and experimentation in science (choice C), or take issue with the idea that scientists make slow, steady progress (choice D). The passage does not address intellectual arrogance hindering scientific progress (choice E). Therefore, the best answer is choice B.
