  The correct answer is indeed E. The passage does not mention the size of neurotransmitter binding sites on receptors playing a role in neuron communication. The other options are all affirmed by the passage as relevant to neuron communication:

* A: The secretion of certain chemicals plays a role in neuron communication.
* B: The flow of ions through neurons plays a role in neuron communication.
* C: The binding of neurotransmitters to receptors plays a role in neuron communication.
* D: The structure of receptors on neuron surfaces plays a role in neuron communication.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: The size of neurotransmitter binding sites on receptors does not play a role in neuron communication, as it is not mentioned in the passage.
