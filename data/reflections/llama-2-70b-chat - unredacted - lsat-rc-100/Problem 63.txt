  Action: Answer("C")

The author discusses metaphor in the second paragraph primarily in order to emphasize the centrality of poetic language to corridos. The author notes that figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, but when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. The author also highlights the use of storm imagery in corridos, which is a conventional and recognizable feature of the genre. This emphasis on poetic language serves to underscore the importance of language in shaping the corrido tradition and its narratives. Therefore, option C is the best answer.
