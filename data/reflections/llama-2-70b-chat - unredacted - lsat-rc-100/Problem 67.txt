  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52-54) serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. The author argues that entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, which involves structuring their prices to consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. This explanation reinforces the thesis that technological developments have served as a democratizing force and narrowed the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the reference to maximization of financial success is not part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.

Option B is incorrect because the author does not present the reference to maximization of financial success as a logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.

Option C is incorrect because the author does not present the reference to maximization of financial success as a speculative hypothesis.

Option E is incorrect because the author does not present the reference to maximization of financial success as part of a concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.
