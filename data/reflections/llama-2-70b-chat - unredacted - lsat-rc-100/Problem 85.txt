  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The author discusses primary substances in order to contrast them with secondary substances and to help explain the latter's role in plant evolution. The author notes that primary substances are essential for plant growth and metabolism, while secondary substances have no known role in these processes but are responsible for the distinctive tastes and smells of plants. The author suggests that secondary substances have evolved as a result of genetic mutations in response to natural selection, and that they play a role in plant defense against insects. Therefore, option B is the best answer.
