  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The correct answer is E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.

The passage argues that increased specialization leads to increased productivity, but it also suggests that there are limits to this specialization. If specialization leads to higher training costs and increased turnover, then it's possible that the benefits of increased specialization may be offset by these costs. This means that there may be a point where further specialization does not lead to increased productivity, and therefore, increased size may not necessarily lead to monopoly power.

Therefore, option E undermines the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power, as it suggests that there may be limits to the benefits of specialization, and that increased size may not always lead to increased productivity.
