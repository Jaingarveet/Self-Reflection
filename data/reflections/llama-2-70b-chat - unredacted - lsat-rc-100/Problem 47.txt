  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
Passage B differs from Passage A in that it is more dependent on unsubstantiated assumptions. While Passage A accepts the reliability of fingerprint identification, Passage B questions its reliability, highlighting the lack of objective standards for evaluating matches, the variation in local practices, and the unknown error rate. Passage B also cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34% rate of erroneous identification, suggesting that the issue is more complex and nuanced than Passage A acknowledges.

Passage A, on the other hand, does not rely on unsubstantiated assumptions. It accepts the reliability of fingerprint identification based on its long-standing use in criminal trials and the fact that experts have long concurred about its reliability, despite the lack of scientific standards or rigorous testing.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: dependent on unsubstantiated assumptions.
