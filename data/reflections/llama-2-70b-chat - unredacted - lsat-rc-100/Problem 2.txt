  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The correct answer is D, as it best exemplifies the author of passage B's characterization of evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory." The author suggests that genes may promote their own propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child. This implies that the mother's behavior is not solely motivated by her own interests or desires, but is also influenced by an interest in promoting the survival and replication of her genes. This is an example of the kind of "conspiracy" that the author of passage B is referring to, as it attributes an interest in gene propagation to the mother's behavior without her conscious awareness or acknowledgment.

The other options do not clearly exemplify this aspect of evolutionary psychology. Option A is a general statement about the approach of evolutionary psychology, which does not necessarily imply a "conspiracy theory." Option B is a statement about the difficulty of explaining altruism from an evolutionary perspective, which does not necessarily involve attributing hidden motives to individuals. Option C is a description of altruistic behavior, which does not necessarily imply a hidden interest in gene propagation. Option E is a statement about the living arrangements of early humans, which is not directly relevant to the concept of evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory."
