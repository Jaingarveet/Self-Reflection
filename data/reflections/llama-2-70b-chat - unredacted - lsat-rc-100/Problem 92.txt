  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education argues that understanding other cultures requires adopting the perspectives and methods of those cultures, which Western scientific methods cannot achieve. Therefore, option E, which asserts that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education. It emphasizes the importance of understanding other cultures, which the second version of multicultural education fails to achieve by relying on Western scientific methods.

Option A is incorrect because, although it may be difficult for outsiders to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture, it is not impossible. Option B is also incorrect because the similarity of value systems among non-Western societies does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding cultures with different values. Option C is incorrect because, although some non-Western societies may use their own value systems when studying cultures with different values, this does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding cultures with different values. Option D is unrelated to the criticism in the passage and does not address the issue of understanding other cultures.

Therefore, the correct answer is option E.
