  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. He defined "artistry" as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Option A is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy. In fact, Dostoyevsky believed that reality and fantasy were intimately bound up with each other, and that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.

Option B is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. Dostoyevsky believed that artistry was the ability to write well, and that a literary work must be judged on its artistic merit, regardless of its purpose.

Option C is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works. In fact, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.

Option E is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is. Dostoyevsky believed that the demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless, and that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
