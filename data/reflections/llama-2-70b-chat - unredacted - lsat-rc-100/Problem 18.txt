  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The word "selectively" in Passage B is most closely related to the word "discretionary" in Passage A. In Passage B, "selectively" is used to describe the plan to cut off water to a few residences with outstanding bills, implying that the choice of which residences to target is left to the discretion of the officials. Similarly, in Passage A, "discretionary" refers to the power of law enforcement agencies to exercise their discretion in deciding which cases to pursue, rather than being strictly bound by the letter of the law. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) "discretionary".
