  Action: Answer(D)

The passage states that "the fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young." It also notes that proverbs are used by parents as a teaching tool, particularly in the regulation of peer-group relationships. However, the passage does not suggest that this emphasis on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes Mexican American communities from other communities within the United States. Therefore, option E is not supported by the passage.

Option D, on the other hand, is supported by the passage, which states that "each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs." This suggests that the meaning of a proverb can vary depending on the context in which it is used, and that it is not necessarily fixed. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it states that there are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs.
