  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The principle that underlies both passages is that fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable. Passage A argues that while there may be some issues with the reliability of fingerprint identification, it has been used for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability. However, it also notes that there are no established error rates revealing how often fingerprint examiners incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a particular person's, and that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. It also notes that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.

Therefore, option E is the best answer.
