  Action: Answer("C")

The passage states that corridos have a formal closing verse, or despedida, which is a set convention that varies according to exigencies of rhyme. This suggests that corridos use a formal structure and follow specific conventions, which is characteristic of the genre.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

A: The passage does not mention the use of exaggeration to embellish Border events as a characteristic of corridos.

D: The passage does not mention the use of complex rhyme schemes as a characteristic of corridos.

E: The passage does not mention the use of verses that combine Spanish and English as a characteristic of corridos.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
