  Action: Answer(C)

The passage presents three positions on the role of literature: the radical view that art should be useful and serve a particular political view, the realist view that art should depict reality "as it is," and Dostoyevsky's view that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it and that the fantastic is intimately bound up with the real. The passage elaborates on Dostoyevsky's view in detail, explaining how it differs from the radical view and the realist view. Therefore, choice C accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage.

The correct answer is C.
