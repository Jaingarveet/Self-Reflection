  Action: Answer("C")

The author suggests that the ease of keeping books "in print" will be a significant factor in the eventual acceptance of the new digital model. The author states that digital publishing allows for the instantaneous transmission and retrieval of digital text, making it possible to print books on demand at point of sale, eliminating the costs associated with traditional publishing, and making it possible to keep a virtually limitless digital catalog of books in print. The author also notes that this will make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing, which will likely lead to its eventual acceptance.

The other options are not supported by the text. There is no mention of changing literary tastes (A), the role of literary agents (C), innovative marketing strategies (D), or widespread familiarity with new ways of storing information (E) as factors in the acceptance of the new digital model.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
