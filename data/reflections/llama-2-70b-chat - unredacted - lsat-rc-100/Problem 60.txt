  Action: Answer(E)

The passage suggests that the author would agree with the statement that a corrido without a surviving despedida would be incomplete or lacking in some way. The author highlights the importance of the despedida in marking the end of the ballad and emphasizes its role in asserting the authenticity of the corrido's tale. The absence of a despedida would likely detract from the corrido's impact and significance, as it would lack the formal closing verse that is a hallmark of the genre. Therefore, option E is the best answer.
