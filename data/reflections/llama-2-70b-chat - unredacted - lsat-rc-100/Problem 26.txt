  Action: Answer(A)

The passage presents two opposing views on how to deter deliberate crimes and then applies an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. The principle of utility maximization is used to show that the two approaches are not mutually exclusive and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both strategies. Therefore, option A accurately describes the passage's organization.
