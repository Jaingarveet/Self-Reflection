Advice:
- Pay close attention to the meaning and usage of key terms.
- Carefully analyze the structure and logic of the argument.
- Consider the context and purpose of the argument.
- Be aware of potential biases and fallacies.
- Choose the answer that best reflects the argumentative technique used.
- In this specific case, remember that a "factic" is a statement of fact, and the argument is not rejecting a fact but rather suggesting a specific way to frame an accusation. 
- Additionally, the argument is not primarily concerned with helping the group reach a consensus but rather with making a logically sound and less offensive accusation.
