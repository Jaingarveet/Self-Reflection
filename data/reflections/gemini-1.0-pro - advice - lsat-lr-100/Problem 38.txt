Advice:
- Be cautious of arguments that rely heavily on assumptions about individuals or groups.
- Consider alternative explanations and potential biases, but do not automatically dismiss arguments based solely on such factors.
- Focus on the logical structure of the argument and the validity of its reasoning.
- Choose answers that address the core issues of the argument rather than focusing solely on potential biases.
- Remember that even individuals with personal interests can provide sound reasoning and legitimate grounds for their claims.
