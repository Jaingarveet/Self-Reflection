Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the flawed reasoning in the original argument. The flaw lies in the assumption that two overlapping groups (auto mechanics with extensive experience and mechanics who understand electronic circuits) represent the majority of all auto mechanics. I incorrectly identified the flaw as not accounting for other possible causes, which led me to choose the wrong answer.
