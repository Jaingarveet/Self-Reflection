Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made an assumption that was not directly supported by the information provided. The passage does not explicitly state that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than those who flew prior to 1985. It only states that the conditions for the spread of airborne illnesses are more favorable now due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.
