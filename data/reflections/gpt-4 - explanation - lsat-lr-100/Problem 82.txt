Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the skills of the ninjas rather than the proportion of the population that could have been affected by the fear of ninjas. I misunderstood the argument that Patricia needed to counter. Patricia's argument was about the general population's fear, not the effectiveness of the countermeasures against ninjas.
