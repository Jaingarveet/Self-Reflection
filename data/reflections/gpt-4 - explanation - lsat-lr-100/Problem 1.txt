I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the logical implications of the statements. I focused on the difficulty of growing cacti in humid climates and raising orange trees in cold climates, and concluded that most parts of the country cannot be humid. However, I overlooked the possibility that a part of the country could be both humid and cold, which would make it difficult to grow both cacti and orange trees.
