Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the potential misleading nature of the absence of the mosaics, rather than considering the broader implications of the archaeologist's argument. The archaeologist's argument is not just about the potential for future archaeologists to be misled, but also about the overall value of leaving the mosaics in place.
