Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information given in the context. I focused on the fact that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals, and concluded that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films. However, the correct answer is that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.
