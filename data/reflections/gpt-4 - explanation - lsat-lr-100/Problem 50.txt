Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the behavior of the smokers (smoking more cigarettes) rather than the physiological limitations of nicotine absorption. The correct answer indicates that there is a limit to how much nicotine the blood can absorb in a day, which explains why the nicotine levels are the same regardless of the nicotine content in the cigarettes.
