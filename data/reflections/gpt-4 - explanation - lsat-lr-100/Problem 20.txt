Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the defendant's ignorance of the difference between the two codes, rather than the judge's reasoning that the defendant's excuse would have been acceptable if he had been charged with noncompliance with local codes. This implies that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
