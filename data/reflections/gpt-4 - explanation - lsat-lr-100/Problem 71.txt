Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the curator's statement about the prints available in the museum store. I assumed that all prints sold in the store are of twentieth-century works, but the curator only mentioned that prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the store, not all works on display.
