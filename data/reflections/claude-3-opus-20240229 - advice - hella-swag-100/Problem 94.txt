Advice:
 - Always read questions fully and carefully consider all key details, not just the overall topic.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions based on your existing knowledge of a subject.
 - Evaluate each answer choice in turn to determine if it's a logical fit, rather than jumping to conclusions.
 - Remember that sometimes the correct answer may describe an unusual or unexpected action for the given context.
 - If you're unsure, re-read the question and try to reason step-by-step based only on the information provided.
