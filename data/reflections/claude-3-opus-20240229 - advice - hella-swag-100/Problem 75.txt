Advice:
- Always read carefully for context clues about the author's tone and intent.
- Be on the lookout for signs a text may be satirical, sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek rather than literal.
- Consider how formatting elements like [headers] and [titles] can indicate a text's purpose or style.
- Don't assume a "straightforward" answer is always correct, especially with an unconventional writing style.
- Ask yourself if the given text and answer choices are genuinely trying to inform, or if they have a more satirical intent to entertain or critique.
