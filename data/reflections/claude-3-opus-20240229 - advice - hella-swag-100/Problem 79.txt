Advice:
 - Always pay attention to the context and wording of the question to understand what kind of answer is expected.
 - Don't make assumptions based on real-world scenarios if the question is about a hypothetical or fictional situation.
 - Carefully consider each answer choice and eliminate those that are clearly irrelevant or illogical.
 - Look for the choice that most logically and completely fits the context of the question.
