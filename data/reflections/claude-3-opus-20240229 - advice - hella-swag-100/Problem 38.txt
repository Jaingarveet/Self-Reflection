Advice:
 - Always consider the larger context and framing, not just the immediate action.
 - Be open to perspective shifts or zooming out, not just linear continuations.
 - Eliminate choices that introduce inconsistent or irrelevant elements.
 - The most likely completion should make logical sense, but may provide new context to the original text.
 - If an answer choice recontextualizes the scene in a reasonable way, it may be the most likely completion even if it doesn't directly continue the action.
