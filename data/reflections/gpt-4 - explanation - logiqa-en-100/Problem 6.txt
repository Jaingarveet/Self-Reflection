Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I correctly understood that the team cannot go to Lake J and must therefore go to Lake G. However, I failed to apply the second condition correctly, which states that if the team doesn't go to either City E or City F, they can't go to Lake G. Since they must go to Lake G, they must also visit either City E or City F. However, since they can't go to Mountain H without going to City E (according to condition 3), and they can't go to City E (since they can't go to Mountain H), they must go to City F.
