Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question's requirement. The question asked for the option that would weaken the argument most. While my chosen answer (B) does provide a potential explanation for the increase in posts, it does not directly challenge the argument's validity. The correct answer (D) weakens the argument by suggesting that the forum is a legal forum, implying that the posts may not accurately reflect the overall social atmosphere.
