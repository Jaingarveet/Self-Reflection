Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the nature of the argument. The argument was about the increase in Chinese investment in US real estate being due to more rich people in China transferring their property abroad. I chose an answer that provided a different reason for the increase in Chinese investment, but it did not directly counter the argument about wealth transfer.
