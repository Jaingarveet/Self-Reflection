Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the third condition, which states that if X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. This means that if [REDACTED] are both in the sales department, W would have to be in the production department, which would leave no room for F, who must be in the production department. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot both be in the sales department.
