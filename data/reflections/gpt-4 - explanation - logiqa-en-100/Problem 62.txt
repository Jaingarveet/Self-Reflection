Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the expert's opinion about the cause of the salamander's decline (being trampled by cattle and sheep) and chose the option that directly contradicted this. However, the question asked for the option that would raise the most doubts about the expert's opinion. The correct answer (B) introduces a new potential cause for the decline (changes in the water environment), which would indeed raise more doubts about the expert's opinion than my chosen answer.
