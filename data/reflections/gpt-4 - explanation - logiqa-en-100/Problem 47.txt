Explanation:
I misunderstood the logical structure of the statements. I focused on the part of the statement that said a company that needs financing cannot have dividends, and a company without dividends must need financing. However, I overlooked the fact that a company with dividends does not need financing, and a company that does not need financing can have dividends. This led me to choose the wrong answer.
