Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the first condition that H and Y must be allocated in the same department. I focused on the condition that if X is in the same department as F, then W must be in the production department, and concluded that W cannot be in the public relations department. However, I failed to consider that if X and F are in the production department, and W is also in the production department, then there is no room for H in the production department, given that H and Y must be together.
