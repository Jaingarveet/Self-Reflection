Explanation:
I made a mistake in interpreting the constraints and did not correctly identify all possible valid arrangements.
Error Keywords:
 - Constraint misinterpretation
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Solution space oversight
Solution:
1. Pharmacy at one end, restaurant at the other:
    - This leaves 5 spaces in the middle for the remaining 5 businesses.
2. Restaurants separated by at least 2 businesses:
    - This means there must be at least 1 business between them, and they cannot be adjacent.
3. Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian:
    - This leaves 2 options for the pharmacy's placement.
4. Toy store not next to veterinarian:
    - This further restricts the placement options.
5. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all constraints.
2. Identify all possible valid arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
3. Do not prematurely eliminate options without thorough analysis.
4. Consider all possible permutations and combinations.
5. Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure all constraints are met.
6. Choose the answer that represents all valid arrangements.
Advice:
 - Be meticulous in interpreting and applying constraints.
 - Consider all possible scenarios and permutations.
 - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.
 - Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - When multiple valid solutions exist, identify and present all of them.
