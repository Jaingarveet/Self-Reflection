Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the book on the middle shelf must be I. However, the question only states that I is placed on the middle shelf, not that it is the only book on the middle shelf.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Incomplete information processing
 - Overlooking possibilities
Solution:
G is placed on the top shelf.
I is placed on the middle shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
F is placed on the same shelf as M.
More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
Top shelf: G
Middle shelf: [REDACTED]
Bottom shelf: F, H, M, O
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the given conditions.
2. Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the question.
3. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
4. Eliminate options that contradict any of the given conditions.
5. Choose the option that satisfies all the given conditions and provides the most complete and accurate information.
Advice:
 - Be mindful of making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
 - Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions, even if they seem unlikely.
 - Carefully analyze each option and eliminate those that contradict any of the given conditions.
 - Choose the option that provides the most complete and accurate information based on the given conditions.
