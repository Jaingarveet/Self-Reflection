Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report could not be on Tuesday. 
I overlooked the possibility that Nina could give a report on Tuesday, followed by Helen and Irving on Wednesday, even though George also gave a report on Tuesday.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking possibilities
 - Misinterpreting conditions
 - Ignoring logical implications
Solution:
George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.
George can only give a report on Tuesday.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports.
Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on either Monday or Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
But George also gives a report on Tuesday, which violates the condition that only two reports can be given on each day.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
Since George also gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the key facts and conditions from the problem statement.
2. Analyze the implications of each condition and how they interact with each other.
3. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
4. Eliminate scenarios that violate any of the conditions.
5. Identify the remaining scenarios that satisfy all conditions.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to one of the remaining scenarios.
Advice:
 - Carefully read and understand all conditions and implications.
 - Consider all possible scenarios, even those that seem unlikely at first.
 - Systematically eliminate scenarios that violate any conditions.
 - Be mindful of logical implications and how they constrain the possibilities.
 - Double-check your reasoning and conclusions to ensure they are consistent with the problem statement.
