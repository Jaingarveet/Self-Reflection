Solution:
1. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery.
2. It ascends tortuously along the side of the face, deep to the Platysma and Risorius muscles.
3. At the angle of the mouth, it gives off the superior and inferior labial arteries.
4. It then ascends along the side of the nose as the angular artery.
5. The angular artery terminates in an anastomosis with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery, between the eye and the nose.
6. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies the eye and surrounding structures.
Therefore, the facial artery terminates in an anastomosis with a branch of the ophthalmic artery.
