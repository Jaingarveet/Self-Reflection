Solution:
The uterine tube (fallopian tube) has four main segments:
1. [REDACTED]: The funnel-shaped distal end, closest to the ovary. Relatively wide.
2. [REDACTED]: The widest and longest part, where fertilization usually occurs. Not the narrowest.
3. [REDACTED]: The narrow, straight segment connecting the ampulla to the uterus. Narrower than infundibulum and ampulla.
4. [REDACTED]: The segment passing through the uterine wall. The narrowest part of the uterine tube.
Therefore, the narrowest part of the uterine tube is the interstitial portion.
