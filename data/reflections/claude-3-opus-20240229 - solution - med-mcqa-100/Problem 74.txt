Solution:
1. The patient has undergone lateral skull base surgery and is now experiencing recurrent aspirations, suggesting a problem with airway protection during swallowing.
2. The superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) is a branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) that provides sensory innervation to the larynx above the vocal cords and motor innervation to the cricothyroid muscle.
3. The SLN plays a crucial role in protecting the airway during swallowing by causing the larynx to close, preventing food or liquid from entering the trachea and lungs.
4. Injury to the SLN can lead to reduced laryngeal sensation and impaired closure of the larynx during swallowing, increasing the risk of aspiration.
5. The absence of voice changes in the patient suggests that the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), which innervates the intrinsic muscles of the larynx responsible for vocal cord movement, is likely intact.
Therefore, the most likely nerve injured during the lateral skull base surgery is the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN).
