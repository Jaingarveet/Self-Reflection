Solution:
In the context of randomization in a research study:
- Each subject has an equal probability of being assigned to any group 
- The probability of being assigned to each group is known (e.g., 50% for a two-group study)
- The actual group assignment for each subject is determined randomly and is unknown/unpredictable before randomization
Therefore, "random" in randomization implies equal and known chances for group assignment.
