Solution:
1. Desquamation is the shedding of the outer layers of the skin, a common side effect of radiation therapy.
2. In most cases, desquamation from radiation is mild and self-limited.
3. [REDACTED] is typically sufficient for managing mild radiation-induced desquamation.
4. More aggressive treatments like topical agents (e.g., petroleum jelly), antibiotics, or surgery are usually not necessary.
5. Intervention is only needed if the desquamation is severe or there are signs of infection.
Therefore, observation alone (B) is the most appropriate management for post-radiation desquamation in most cases.
