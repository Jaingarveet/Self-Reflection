Solution:
1. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate.
2. Glycolysis occurs in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
3. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain.
4. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactate to regenerate NAD+.
5. During glycolysis, there is a net production of [REDACTED] molecules.
6. In the glycolysis pathway, there are two steps where NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
7. In anaerobic conditions, the NADH must be oxidized back to NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue.
8. The oxidation of NADH to NAD+ is coupled with the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.
9. Therefore, in anaerobic glycolysis, the end products are [REDACTED] molecules and 2 NAD+ molecules.
