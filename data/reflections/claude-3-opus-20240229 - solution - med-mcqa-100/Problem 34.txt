Solution:
1. Spring catarrh, also known as vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a type of allergic conjunctivitis.
2. Allergic re[REDACTED]tions are classified into four main types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions (I, II, III, and IV).
3. Type I hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions are immediate allergic re[REDACTED]tions mediated [REDACTED]y IgE anti[REDACTED]odies.
4. Type IV hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions are delayed-type re[REDACTED]tions mediated [REDACTED]y T cells.
5. Spring catarrh primarily involves Type I (IgE-mediated) and to a lesser extent Type IV (T cell-mediated) hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.
Therefore, the correct answer is that spring catarrh involves [REDACTED]oth Type I and Type IV hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions (choice B).
