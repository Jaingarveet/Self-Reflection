Solution:
Given information:
 - Cervical dilation: 3 cm 
 - Cervical consistency: Slightly soft
 - Cervical position: Anterior 
 - Fetal station: -1
 - Cervical length: < 0.5 cm
Calculating Bishop score:
1. Cervical dilation of 3 cm = 2 points
2. Slightly soft cervical consistency = 1 point 
3. Anterior cervical position = 1 point
4. Fetal station of -1 = 1 point
5. Cervical length < 0.5 cm = 2 points
Total Bishop score = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = [REDACTED] points
However, [REDACTED] points corresponds to choice [REDACTED], which is incorrect.
Let's recheck the addition: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = [REDACTED] points
Therefore, the correct Bishop score is [REDACTED], which corresponds to choice [REDACTED].
