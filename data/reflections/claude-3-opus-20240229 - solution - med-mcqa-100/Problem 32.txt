Solution:
The question stem mentions that a 60-year-old male presents with right-sided nasal obstruction and blood-tinged nasal discharge. It also states that biopsy findings are shown, which would be essential in differentiating between the given choices. 
[REDACTED], [REDACTED], and rhinosporidiosis can all present with similar symptoms of nasal obstruction and blood-tinged discharge. However, each condition has characteristic histopathological findings that help in making the correct diagnosis.
Without seeing the actual biopsy findings, it is impossible to make a definitive diagnosis. The correct answer, rhinosporidiosis, would be confirmed by the presence of fungal sporangia on histopathology, which is a unique feature of this condition.
