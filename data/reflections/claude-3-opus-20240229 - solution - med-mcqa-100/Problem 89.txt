Solution:
1. Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over the vertebra below it.
2. The key diagnostic feature is the forward slippage, best seen on lateral view X-rays.
3. [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is a crucial investigation as it clearly demonstrates the forward slippage.
4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] provide additional detailed information about bony abnormalities, nerve compression, and soft tissue involvement.
5. Anteroposterior (AP) X-ray is not particularly useful in diagnosing spondylolisthesis as it does not show the forward slippage effectively.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDA[REDACTED]ED]: [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is NOT a useful investigation for spondylolisthesis.
