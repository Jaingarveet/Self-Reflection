Solution:
1. The patient has a 5x5 cm primary tumor in the right upper lobe and a 2x2 cm nodule in the right middle lobe. 
2. Both lesions are confined to the right lung with no evidence of distant metastases mentioned.
3. In the absence of distant metastases, the presence of a separate tumor nodule in the same lobe (T3) or different ipsilateral lobe (T4) still potentially allows for surgical resection if the patient has adequate lung function.
4. Complete surgical resection of both lesions would be the preferred primary treatment if feasible, as it provides the best chance for cure in localized non-small cell lung cancer.
5. [REDACTED] and radiation would likely be recommended after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence, but surgery is still the primary modality.
