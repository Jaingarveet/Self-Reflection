Solution:
Senescent red blood cells are older red blood cells that are nearing the end of their lifespan. Among the different species of malaria parasites, Plasmodium malariae, which causes quartan malaria, has a greater affinity for invading and multiplying within these older, senescent red blood cells. In contrast, Plasmodium falciparum (falciparum malaria), Plasmodium vivax (vivax malaria), and Plasmodium ovale (ovale malaria) prefer to invade younger red blood cells.
