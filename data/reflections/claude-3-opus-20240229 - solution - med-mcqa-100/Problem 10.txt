Solution:
1. Etched enamel patterns are observed when enamel is treated with acid, as in the process of dental bonding.
2. The different types of etched enamel patterns are classified based on their appearance under a microscope.
3. The Type 1 pattern is characterized by a honeycomb-like appearance with distinct prism cores.
4. The Type 2 pattern, in contrast, has a more irregular, bumpy surface that resembles cobblestones.
5. The Type 3 pattern shows a mixture of the Type 1 and Type 2 patterns.
Therefore, the Type 2 pattern of etched enamel is known as the "Cobblestone pattern".
