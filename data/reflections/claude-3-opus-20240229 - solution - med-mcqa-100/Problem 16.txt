Solution:
1. The axillary artery is the main artery of the upper limb, divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle.
2. If the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed, blood supply to the upper limb can be maintained by anastomoses with arteries that are not direct branches of the axillary artery.
3. The deep branch of the transverse cervical artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk of the subclavian artery.
4. The subscapular artery is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery.
5. There is an important anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery.
6. This anastomosis can provide collateral circulation to the upper limb if the second part of the axillary artery is obstructed.
