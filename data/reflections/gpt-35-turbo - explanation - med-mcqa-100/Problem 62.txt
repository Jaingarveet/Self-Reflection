Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I confused the fallopian tube with the uterine tube. The fallopian tube has three parts: infundibulum, ampulla, and isthmus, while the uterine tube has two parts: the isthmus and the interstitial part. The narrowest part of the uterine tube is the interstitial part, which is the part that passes through the uterine wall.
