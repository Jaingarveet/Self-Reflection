Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED], which is incorrect. The correct answer is [REDACTED]. The subscapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery anastomose to form the scapular anastomosis, which provides collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction of the axillary artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries are not part of this anastomosis and do not provide collateral circulation in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
