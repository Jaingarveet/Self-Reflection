Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by choosing option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], as the antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid. The correct answer is [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in pathology but in the specific antigens involved in Cicatricial pemphigoid. 
I knew the general concept of Cicatricial pemphigoid and salt split skin technique but did not know the specific antigen involved.
