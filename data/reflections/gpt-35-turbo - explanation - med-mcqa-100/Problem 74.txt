Explanation:
I incorrectly chose the vagus nerve as the nerve most likely injured during surgery. The correct answer is the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) because it is responsible for the sensation of the larynx and the cough reflex. Damage to the SLN can cause difficulty in swallowing and recurrent aspirations. The glossopharyngeal nerve is also involved in swallowing, but it is not the most likely nerve to be injured during lateral skull base surgery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is responsible for the movement of the vocal cords and can cause hoarseness if damaged during surgery.
