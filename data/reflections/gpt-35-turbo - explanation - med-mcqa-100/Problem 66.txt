Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by choosing option [REDACTED] instead of option [REDACTED].
The gap in my knowledge was not in the transmission of Hepatitis [REDACTED] virus but in the timing of virus shedding in feces.
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because Hepatitis [REDACTED] virus shedding in feces starts two weeks before the symptoms appear and continues for two weeks after the onset of symptoms.
