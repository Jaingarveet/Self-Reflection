Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by choosing the liver as the site of transplantation for islet cell transplant for diabetes mellitus. The correct answer is the portal vein. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in anatomy but in the specific details of the procedure. 
I knew that islet cell transplantation is used to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus, but I did not know the specific site of transplantation.
