Explanation:
I misidentified the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion associated with spring catarrh. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the classification of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions. 
I knew that spring catarrh was an allergic re[REDACTED]tion [REDACTED]ut did not know the correct type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion.
