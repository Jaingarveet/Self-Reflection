Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not know that [REDACTED] does not require aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] for protein synthesis. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the specific amino acids that require aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] for protein synthesis. 
I knew that aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] was required for protein synthesis, but I did not know which amino acids required it.
