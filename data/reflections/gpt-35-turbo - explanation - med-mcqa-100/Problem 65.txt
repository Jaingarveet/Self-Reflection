Explanation:
I incorrectly chose petroleum jellies as the treatment for post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation. The correct answer is observation alone. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in radiology but in the treatment of post-radiation skin lesions. 
I knew what desquamation was and that topical agents could be used to treat it, but I did not know that observation alone was the recommended treatment.
