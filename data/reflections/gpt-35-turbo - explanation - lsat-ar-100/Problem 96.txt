Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect. I assumed that since Himalayans were not featured on day 2, they must be featured on days 4, 5, and 6. However, this is not necessarily true. Himalayans could be featured on any three days other than day 1 and day 2. Therefore, Rottweilers could be featured on day 5, which means that choice [REDACTED] could be true. However, choice [REDACTED] is also a possibility since Siamese could be featured on day 4.
