Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], as the target that must also be 2 days. However, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. This is because the question states that [REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. If Image's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Therefore, [REDACTED] must also be 2 days to satisfy the conditions.
