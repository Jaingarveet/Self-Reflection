Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that Theresa would test H on the first day, but that is not necessarily true. 
If Theresa tests G on the second day, then H must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
Reynaldo cannot test F. 
Yuki cannot test J. 
Therefore, Reynaldo must test J on the first day. 
And, Yuki must test F on the first day. 
This leaves Seamus to test H on the first day, and Theresa to test J on the second day. 
Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day.
