Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible days that Himalayans could be featured.
I correctly identified that Himalayans could not be featured on day 1, but I incorrectly assumed that they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
The correct days that Himalayans could be featured are days 2, 4, and 5.
I also failed to consider the restriction that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
