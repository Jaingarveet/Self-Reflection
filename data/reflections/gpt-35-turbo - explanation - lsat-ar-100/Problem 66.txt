Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if Y is fifth, we can determine the order of all the articles. However, this is not true. If Y is fifth, we know that S must be earlier than Y, which means that S must be either first, second, or third. However, we don't know the order of the remaining articles. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED]. If R is fourth, we can determine the order of all the articles except the last one. If R is fourth, then G must be first, J must be second, R must be fourth, Q must be fifth, S must be sixth, H must be seventh, and Y must be third.
