Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the constraints in the problem. 
The problem states that [REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s. 
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] must lead the Wednesday session. 
If [REDACTED] leads the Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] must lead the Thursday session, which violates the constraint that [REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s. 
Therefore, [REDACTED] must lead the Wednesday session, and [REDACTED] must lead the Thursday session.
