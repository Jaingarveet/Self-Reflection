Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the schedule of the lab assistants. 
I correctly identified that Julio's session must be on Thursday afternoon and that Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
However, I incorrectly assumed that Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
I also incorrectly assumed that Lan's session must be on Wednesday.
