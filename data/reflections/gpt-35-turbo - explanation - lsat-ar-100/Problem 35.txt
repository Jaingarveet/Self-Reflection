Explanation:
I misinterpreted the given conditions and made an incorrect deduction. 
I assumed that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the third batch of peanut butter cookies. However, this is not necessarily true. 
The correct deduction is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies.
