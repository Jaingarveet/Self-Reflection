Explanation:
My reasoning was correct up to a point, but I made an error in identifying the possible positions for the composition F. 
If O is performed immediately after T, then the order of the compositions must be T, O, and then the remaining six compositions. 
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately before T. 
If T is performed immediately before F, then at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
Therefore, F must be performed either [REDACTED].
However, I missed the fact that the eighth composition performed is either L or H, which means that F cannot be performed seventh.
