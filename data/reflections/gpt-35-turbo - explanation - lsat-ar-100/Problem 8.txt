Explanation:
I correctly identified that the bay holding livestock must be in [REDACTED] or 3, but I did not consider all of the given information. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, which means that the bay holding livestock cannot be in [REDACTED] because that would mean the bay holding textiles would have to be in [REDACTED] or 3, which is not possible. Therefore, the only possible bay for livestock is [REDACTED].
