Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the bay holding [REDACTED] must be in bay 5 or 6. However, the problem only states that the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], but it does not specify which bays they are in. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect, and my subsequent reasoning was also incorrect.
