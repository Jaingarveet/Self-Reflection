Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that Truvest's website target must be 3 days because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. However, this assumption is incorrect because Solide's website target could be 1 day, which means Truvest's website target could be either 2 days or 3 days. Therefore, Truvest's website target could still be shorter than Image's website target, which means the correct answer is [REDACTED].
