Explanation:
My mistake was in assuming that F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves if G is placed on the top shelf. However, the problem only states that at least two books are placed on each shelf, not that all books are placed on the shelves. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because if G is placed on the top shelf, then F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves. I is placed on the middle shelf, so K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf. F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be placed on the bottom shelf as well. Therefore, the books placed on the middle shelf are I, K, and L.
