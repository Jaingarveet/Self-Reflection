Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday, but it could also be made on Wednesday or Thursday. 
I also did not consider the possibility that the first batch of peanut butter cookies could be made on Friday.
