Explanation:
I misread the question and did not consider all the given conditions. 
I only focused on the fact that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and that only two students can review the same play. 
I did not consider the other conditions, such as Megregian reviewing more plays than Kramer and Lopez and that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
