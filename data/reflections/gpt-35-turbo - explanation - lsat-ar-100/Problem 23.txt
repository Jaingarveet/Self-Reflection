Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition that "If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday." I assumed that if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. However, the condition only applies if Nina's report is given on Tuesday.
