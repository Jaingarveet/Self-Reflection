Explanation:
I misread the question and did not consider all the given conditions. 
I overlooked the fact that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
I also did not consider the fact that Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports.
