Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the hypothesis of the economist. The economist's hypothesis is that developed countries would benefit from the improvement of the natural environment, while developing countries would be compensated for the environmental pollution by solving employment and increasing taxes. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries.
