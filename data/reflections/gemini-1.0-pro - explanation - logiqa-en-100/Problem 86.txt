Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the relative positions of the stations. 
My error was in assuming that Jiushang Station being adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station meant that there were no stations between them. 
This assumption led me to incorrectly conclude that Fuyi Station was on the west side.
