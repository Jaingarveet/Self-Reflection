Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted the meaning of the words "Doximayo" and "Makasey" in the first sentence. 
I assumed that "Doximayo" meant "hostage" and "Makasey" meant "student" based on their positions in the sentence. 
However, the correct interpretation is that [REDACTED] and "Makasey" means "hostage." 
This misinterpretation led me to choose the incorrect answer.
