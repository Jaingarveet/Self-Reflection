Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the condition "There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time" meant that only one assistant could be in charge of multiple departments. This led me to eliminate options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], which all implied that two assistants were in charge of the same department. However, the condition only states that there is one assistant who is in charge of three departments, not that there cannot be other assistants who are in charge of multiple departments.
