Explanation:
The argument relies on the assumption that a person can know exactly how long he can live before deciding whether to steal. 
This assumption is not stated explicitly in the argument, but it is necessary for the argument to be valid. 
Without this assumption, the argument would be flawed because it would be possible for someone to steal something from someone else even if they knew they would live for a long time.
