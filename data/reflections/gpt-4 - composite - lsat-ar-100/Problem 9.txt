Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the rules. I thought that Young could not be assigned parking spaces #1 or #2, but the rules only state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Souza. Therefore, Young could be assigned parking space #2 if Togowa and Souza are assigned parking spaces #1. This misunderstanding led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of rules
- Incorrect elimination of options
Solution:
Given the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Young could be assigned parking space #2 if Togowa and Souza are assigned parking spaces #1. Robertson could be assigned parking space #3 if Young is assigned parking space #2 and Togowa and Souza are assigned parking spaces #1. Therefore, Togowa could be assigned parking space #1.
Instructions:
1. Understand the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.
2. Identify the restrictions for each employee.
3. Determine the possible parking spaces for each employee based on the restrictions.
4. Evaluate each option based on the possible parking spaces for each employee.
5. Choose the option that could be true based on the possible parking spaces for each employee.
Advice:
- Always read and understand the rules before attempting to answer the question.
- Be careful not to misinterpret the rules.
- Evaluate each option carefully based on the rules.
- Do not eliminate options prematurely based on incorrect interpretations of the rules.
