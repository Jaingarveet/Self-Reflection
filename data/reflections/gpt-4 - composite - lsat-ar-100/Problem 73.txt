Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Megregian had to review Undulation because they review more plays than Kramer and Lopez. However, the conditions do not specify which plays each student reviews, only the relative quantity.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Assumption
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. This means Jiang must review Undulation and/or Sunset. Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, it's possible that Megregian reviews all three plays, including Undulation. However, the conditions do not specify that Megregian must review Undulation. Therefore, it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset, making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each student.
3. Determine the possible plays each student can review based on the constraints.
4. Consider the question, which asks for a possible truth given the conditions.
5. Evaluate each answer choice based on the constraints and the question.
6. Choose the answer that fits within the constraints and could be true.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Evaluate each answer choice individually.
- Use logical reasoning to determine the possible scenarios.
- Remember that the question asks for a possible truth, not a definite one.
