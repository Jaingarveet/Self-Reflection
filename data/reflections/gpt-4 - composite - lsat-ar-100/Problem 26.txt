Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I assumed that Wayne had to perform the [REDACTED]th solo because it was a traditional piece. However, the conditions allow for Zara to perform a modern piece in the [REDACTED]th solo, which means Wayne could potentially not perform any traditional pieces.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Conditional reasoning error
- Assumption error
Solution:
The third and [REDACTED]th solos are traditional pieces. The [REDACTED]th solo can be performed by Wayne with a traditional piece or Zara with a modern piece. Since Zara can perform a modern piece in the [REDACTED]th solo, Wayne doesn't necessarily have to perform a traditional piece. The condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least [REDACTED] modern piece also doesn't require Wayne to perform a traditional piece. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece could be [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the constraints for each solo.
3. Determine the possibilities for each solo based on the constraints.
4. Consider all possible scenarios, not just the [REDACTED]s that seem obvious.
5. Choose the answer that fits all conditions and scenarios.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Consider all possible scenarios.
- Practice conditional reasoning problems to improve your skills.
