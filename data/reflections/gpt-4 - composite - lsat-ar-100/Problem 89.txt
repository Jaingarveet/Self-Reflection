Explanation:
I misunderstood the condition that "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day." I incorrectly assumed that this meant no two batches of the same kind of cookie could be made on consecutive days, which led me to eliminate choice [REDACTED]. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension error
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the conditions, the first batch of sugar cookies could be made on Monday. This does not conflict with any of the conditions. The condition that "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day" does not prevent the first batch of sugar cookies from being made on Monday. 
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Interpret the conditions correctly, especially the condition that "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day."
3. Evaluate each choice against the conditions.
4. Do not assume conditions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
5. Choose the answer that does not conflict with any of the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Evaluate each choice against the conditions.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
