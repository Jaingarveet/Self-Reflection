Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions set in the problem. I incorrectly assumed that Solide's website target must also be 2 days, which led me to the wrong conclusion that Truvest's website target must be 3 days. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition application error
Solution:
Given that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the voicemail targets must be either 1 or 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets must be 2 days. 
Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day. 
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Given that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, Solide's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions set in the problem.
2. Apply the conditions to the given situation.

- Use logical reasoning to deduce the answer.
- Double-check your deductions against each answer choice.
- Be aware of your assumptions and make sure they are supported by the conditions in the problem.
