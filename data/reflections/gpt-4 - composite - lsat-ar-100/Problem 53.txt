Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the sequence of the houses to be shown. I assumed that M must be shown in the afternoon because only two houses can be shown in the evening. However, I overlooked the fact that L must be shown after K and before M, which means L must be shown in the afternoon.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Sequence error
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the rules, J must be shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning, and L must be shown after K and before M. This means that K must be shown either in the afternoon or evening, L must be shown after K (so also in the afternoon or evening), and M must be shown after L (so in the evening). However, since J must also be shown in the evening and only two houses can be shown in the evening, one of K, L, or M must be shown in the afternoon. Since K cannot be shown in the morning and L must be shown before M, L must be shown in the afternoon.
Instructions:
1. Understand the rules given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each house.
3. Determine the possible time slots for each house based on the constraints.
4. Identify the houses that must be shown in the evening.
5. Determine the remaining houses that can be shown in the afternoon.
6. Choose the answer that must be true based on the constraints and possible time slots.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Use logical reasoning to determine the sequence of events.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with all the given constraints.
- Practice more problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
