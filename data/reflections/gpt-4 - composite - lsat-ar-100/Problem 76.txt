Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the sequence of the bays. I assumed that the bay holding textiles could not be next to the bay holding fuel, but the question asked which statement must be false, not which could be false. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Sequence error
- Logic error
Solution:
Given the conditions, the bay holding grain must be at a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock must be at a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce must be at a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding textiles must be next to the bay holding produce. 
Given these conditions, the bay holding livestock cannot be next to the bay holding fuel because the bay holding produce (which must be at a higher number than the bay holding fuel) is next to the bay holding textiles (which must be at a lower number than the bay holding livestock). Therefore, the statement that must be false is "[REDACTED]"
Instructions:
1. Understand the sequence of the bays based on the conditions given.
2. Identify the relationships between the different types of cargo.
3. Determine which statements could be true based on these relationships.
4. Identify the statement that must be false based on these relationships.
5. Choose the answer that matches this statement.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Understand the relationships between different elements in a problem.
- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not supported by the information given.
- Remember that a statement that could be false is not necessarily the statement that must be false.
