Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. In my chosen answer, Robertson was assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which contradicts the rules.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking information
- Misinterpretation of rules
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Additionally, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
Looking at the choices again, only choice [REDACTED] satisfies all these conditions. In choice [REDACTED], Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Also, Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is within the range specified.
