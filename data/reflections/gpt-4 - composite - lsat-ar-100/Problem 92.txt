Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I incorrectly assumed that if Quinn and [REDACTED] were in the same zone, Parra and [REDACTED] would also be in the same zone. However, the conditions do not state that Parra and [REDACTED] cannot be in the same zone. The conditions only state that either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical error
- Assumption error
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same zone. If Quinn and [REDACTED] were in the same zone, that would mean Parra and [REDACTED] are in the same zone, which contradicts the condition that either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the relationships between the sales representatives and the zones.
3. Analyze the conditions and relationships to determine which sales representatives cannot work in the same zone.
4. Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches your analysis.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the relationships and conditions before making any conclusions.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it does not contradict any conditions.
