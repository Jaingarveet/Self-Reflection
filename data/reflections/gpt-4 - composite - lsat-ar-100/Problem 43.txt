Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions given in the question. I failed to consider that if Y is fourth, then S, which must be earlier than Y, cannot be third because Q can only be third if S is earlier than Q. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option [REDACTED] and choose option [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition analysis error
Solution:
Given that Y is fourth and S must be earlier than Y, S must be one of the first three. Also, since consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, the first three articles must be a combination of finance and nutrition topics. Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, J cannot be third. However, J can be second. Q cannot be first because S can be earlier than Q only if [REDACTED]. R cannot be seventh because G must be earlier than R and J must be earlier than G, so there must be at least two articles after G. Therefore, the only option that fits all conditions is that [REDACTED]
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Analyze the implications of each condition.
3. Apply the conditions to the possible answers.
4. Eliminate options that do not meet all conditions.
5. Choose the answer that meets all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Analyze each condition and its implications separately.
- Apply logical reasoning to eliminate incorrect options.
- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
