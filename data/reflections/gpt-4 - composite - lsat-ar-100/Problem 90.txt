Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the conditions. I focused on the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and concluded that [REDACTED] cannot be set for more than one client. However, I overlooked the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This condition implies that [REDACTED] cannot be set for more than one client because if it were, the corresponding voicemail target would have to be longer than 3 days, which is not possible.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking conditions
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means that [REDACTED] can only be set for a client if its voicemail target is also 3 days. However, since there are only three possible targets (1 day, 2 days, and 3 days), [REDACTED] would mean that the website target would also have to be 3 days. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be set for more than one client. The correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question and conditions carefully.
2. Understand the implications of each condition.
3. Consider each choice in light of the conditions.
4. Remember that if a client has [REDACTED], its voicemail target cannot be shorter.
5. Choose the answer that cannot be set for more than one client based on the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the implications of each condition.
- Consider each choice in light of the conditions.
- Be careful not to overlook any conditions.
- Use logical reasoning to deduce the correct answer.
