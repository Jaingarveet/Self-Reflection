Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. I focused on the fact that Julio and Kevin were leading morning sessions, but failed to consider the implications of this on the scheduling of the other lab assistants.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking constraints
- Incorrect interpretation
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the constraints, if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then:
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. This means Olivia's session cannot be on Wednesday or Thursday morning, as Julio is leading a morning session and it must be before Olivia's.
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. If Kevin is leading a morning session, Rebecca must lead an afternoon session on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. If Olivia's session is on Friday morning, Lan's session cannot be on Friday afternoon.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This can be any day.
Given these constraints, the only option that cannot be true is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]" If Julio and Kevin are both leading morning sessions, they must be on Wednesday and Thursday. If Lan were to lead a session on Wednesday morning, it would conflict with either Julio or Kevin's session.
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints given in the question.
2. Identify the implications of each constraint.
3. Apply the constraints to each of the answer choices.
4. Identify the answer choice that violates one or more of the constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Understand the implications of each constraint.
- Apply the constraints systematically to each answer choice.
- Be careful not to overlook any constraints or implications.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
