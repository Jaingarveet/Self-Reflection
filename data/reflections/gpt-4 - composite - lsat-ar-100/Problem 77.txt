Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to fully consider the implications of each rule on the parking space assignments. I only considered the direct limitations imposed by each rule, but I did not consider how these rules interacted with each other to further limit the options for each employee.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Logical reasoning error
- Rule application error
Solution:
Let's analyze the rules again:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. This means Young cannot be in space #1 and Togowa cannot be in space #6.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means Xu cannot be in space #1 and Souza cannot be in space #6.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This means Robertson cannot be in space #6 and Young cannot be in space #1.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This further limits Robertson's options.
From these rules, we can see that Robertson, Young, Togowa, Xu, and Souza all have their parking space options limited. However, Robertson, Young, Togowa, and Souza are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces. 
Robertson can only be in spaces #3 or #4, because he must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and he must be in spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
Young can only be in spaces #2 or #3, because he cannot be in spaces #1 (due to rule 3) or #6 (due to rule 1), and since Robertson must be in a higher-numbered space, Young can only be in spaces #2 or #3.
Togowa can only be in spaces #1 or #2, because Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Young can only be in spaces #2 or #3.
Souza can only be in spaces #1 or #2, because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Xu can be in any space except #1.
Instructions:
1. Understand the rules and restrictions given in the problem.
2. Analyze each rule individually and note the direct limitations it imposes on the parking space assignments.
3. Consider how the rules interact with each other to further limit the options for each employee.
4. Identify the employees whose parking space options are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.
5. Count the number of such employees and choose the corresponding answer.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Consider the implications of each rule or restriction individually.
- Consider how the rules or restrictions interact with each other.
- Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
