Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I miscounted the number of lab assistants for whom we can determine the sessions. I included Julio in my count, but the question asked for the number of "other" lab assistants, meaning Julio should not have been included.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Miscounting
- Reading comprehension
Solution:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia cannot lead a session on Thursday because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. So, Olivia must lead a session on Friday. 
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and the Friday afternoon session is the only [REDACTED] left, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. 
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and the only day with [REDACTED] sessions left is Wednesday, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions. 
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan cannot lead a session on Friday. The only session left for Lan is Thursday morning. 
So, we can determine the sessions for [REDACTED] of the other lab assistants: Olivia, Nessa, Kevin, Rebecca, and Lan. However, excluding Julio, we can determine the sessions for only [REDACTED] other lab assistants.
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints given in the question.
2. Apply the constraints to the given situation.
3. Count the number of lab assistants for whom you can determine the sessions, excluding the [REDACTED] menti[REDACTED]d in the question.
4. Choose the answer that matches your count.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Pay attention to words like "other" in the question, which can change the count.
- Double-check your count before choosing an answer.
- Practice more problems to improve your reading comprehension and counting skills.
