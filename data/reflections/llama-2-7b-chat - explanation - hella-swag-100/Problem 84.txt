Explanation:
The text provides instructions for making eggplant fritters, and the correct completion to the text is option [REDACTED]: Beat the egg with a quarter teaspoon of fine salt.

The reason for this is that the text does not provide any information or context that would suggest the other options are relevant or applicable to the recipe. Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because soaking the eggplant in chicken stock would not be necessary for making eggplant fritters. Option [REDACTED] is also incorrect because soaking the eggplant for 30 minutes would not be necessary or beneficial. Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because the cooking time for the eggplant fritters is not mentioned in the text, and adding additional cooking time would not be appropriate.

Therefore, the correct completion to the text is option [REDACTED], which aligns with the instructions provided and makes sense in the context of the recipe.
