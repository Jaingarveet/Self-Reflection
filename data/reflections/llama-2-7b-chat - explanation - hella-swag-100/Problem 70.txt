Explanation:
I made an error in my response as I misinterpreted the scenario. The correct completion to the text is indeed option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The text describes the woman having her hair styled while turned away from the camera, which means she is facing the stylist and not the camera. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would be speaking to the camera or switching hair accessories.
