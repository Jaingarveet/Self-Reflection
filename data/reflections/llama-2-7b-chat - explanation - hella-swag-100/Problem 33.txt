Explanation:
I chose option [REDACTED], "If there is static behind the agitator coils, remove this and check for static." as the correct completion to the text.

The text states that before cleaning the dryer drum, you should unplug the dryer to prevent accidents. This is a crucial step to ensure safety while cleaning the dryer. Option [REDACTED] provides a specific action to take before unplugging the dryer, which is to check for static behind the agitator coils and remove it if necessary.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because it suggests removing an inside fitting and disposing of it, which is not related to cleaning the dryer drum. Option [REDACTED] is also incorrect because it suggests running the dryer on neutral mode, which is not a step in the text. Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it provides a final check to ensure that the dryer has been properly unplugged.
