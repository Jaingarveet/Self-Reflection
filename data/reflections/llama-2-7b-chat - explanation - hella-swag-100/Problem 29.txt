Explanation:
I chose option [REDACTED], "Both work well, so use whichever you have on hand," as the correct answer because it accurately completes the text. The text suggests using calamine lotion or witch hazel to ease the itchiness of chilblains without scratching, and both options are effective. It does not specify which one is better or more effective, so using either option is a viable solution.
