Explanation:
The correct completion to the text is option [REDACTED]: "If you're smoking alone, a small plastic bottle should work. You may want a large plastic bottle if you're smoking with multiple people."

Reasoning:
The text is providing instructions on how to make a gravity bong, which is a simple smoking device that uses gravity to filter and smoke marijuana. The text mentions that any size bottle can be used, but the bigger the bottle, the bigger the hits will be. Option [REDACTED] is the most likely completion because it provides additional information on the size of the bottle based on the number of people smoking. Using a small bottle for smoking alone and a large bottle for multiple people makes sense, as it will provide a more even distribution of the smoke.
