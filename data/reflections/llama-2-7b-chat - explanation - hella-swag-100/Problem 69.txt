Explanation:
I misinterpreted the context of the text and made an incorrect choice. I thought the text was describing a different activity, such as a high jump competition, where the participants stand and clap after their turns. However, the text actually describes a weightlifting competition where the participants lift a heavy barbell and receive a score based on their efforts.
