Advice:
- Always understand the assertion or claim made in the question.
- Evaluate each option in relation to the assertion, not in isolation.
- Look for contradictions to the assertion in the options.
- The option that most directly contradicts the assertion is the most doubtful.
- Don't be distracted by alternative explanations that don't directly address the assertion.
