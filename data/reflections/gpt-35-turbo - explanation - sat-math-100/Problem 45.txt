Explanation:
I correctly identified that the function is linear and used the slope-intercept form, but I made an error in calculating the y-intercept. 
The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is not given in the table. 
Therefore, I should have used the given data to find the slope and then used the slope and any point in the table to find the y-intercept.
