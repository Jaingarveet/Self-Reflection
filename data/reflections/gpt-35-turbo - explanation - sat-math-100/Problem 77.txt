Explanation:
I correctly calculated the mean of both lists, but I made an error in calculating the standard deviation of list [REDACTED]. 
The standard deviation of list [REDACTED] is $\sqrt{\frac{(1-3.5)^2+(2-3.5)^2+(3-3.5)^2+(4-3.5)^2+(5-3.5)^2+(6-3.5)^2}{6}}\approx1.71$.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], not [REDACTED].
