Explanation:
I correctly rewrote the quadratic equation in vertex form by completing the square. However, I made an error in identifying the vertex of the parabola. 
The vertex of the parabola is $(2,-8a)$, not $(2,-d)$.
To find the value of $d$, we need to substitute $2$ into the equation for $x$ and simplify.
$$y=a(2-2)(2+4)$$
$$y=0+12a$$
$$y=12a$$
Thus, $d=12a$.
