Explanation:
I made an error in simplifying the second equation after adding it to the first equation.
I incorrectly simplified $[REDACTED]x+4y=12$ to $[REDACTED]x+2y=[REDACTED]$ instead of $[REDACTED]x+2y=4$.
This led me to believe that the two equations represent the same line and have infinitely many solutions.
