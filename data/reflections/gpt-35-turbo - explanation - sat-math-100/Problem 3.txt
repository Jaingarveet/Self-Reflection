Explanation:
I made a calculation error when multiplying the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$ by $\frac{4}{3}$. 
The correct answer is obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\frac{5}{3}$. 
This gives us $w=\frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3}=\frac{20}{9}$.
