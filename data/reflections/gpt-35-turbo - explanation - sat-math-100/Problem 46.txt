Explanation:
I incorrectly chose the mean as the answer. The range will change the most if the outlier measurement of 24 inches is removed from the data. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the definitions of mean, median, and range, but in understanding the impact of outliers on these measures of central tendency. 
I knew the definitions of mean, median, and range, but did not consider the impact of outliers on these measures.
