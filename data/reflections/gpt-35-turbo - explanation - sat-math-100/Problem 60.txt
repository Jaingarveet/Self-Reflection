Explanation:
My algebraic setup was correct, but I made a mistake in solving the equations.
The correct setup of equations is:
3x + 5 = n
4x + [REDACTED] = n
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
x + [REDACTED] = 0
x = -[REDACTED]
Since the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.
The correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.
n = 3x + 5
n = 4x + [REDACTED]
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
3x + 5 = 4x + [REDACTED]
x = [REDACTED]
Therefore, there are [REDACTED] students in the class.
