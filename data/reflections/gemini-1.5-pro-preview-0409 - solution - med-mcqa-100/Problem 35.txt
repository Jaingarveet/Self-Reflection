Solution:
While I cannot personally analyze the X-ray, I can provide information about each condition and its typical X-ray findings to guide a medical professional in making the diagnosis:
*   **[REDACTED] (Tetralogy of Fallot):** X-ray may show a boot-shaped heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy, and decreased pulmonary vascular markings due to pulmonary stenosis.
*   **[REDACTED] (Ventricular Septal Defect):** X-ray may show cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) and increased pulmonary vascular markings due to increased blood flow to the lungs.
*   **TAPV[REDACTED] (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection):** X-ray may show a "snowman" or "figure-eight" appearance of the heart due to the abnormal drainage of pulmonary veins, and increased pulmonary vascular markings.
*   **TG[REDACTED] (Transposition of the Great Arteries):** X-ray may show an "egg-on-a-string" appearance due to a narrow base of the heart and a large superior mediastinum, and varying degrees of pulmonary vascular markings depending on the presence of associated defects.
**Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")**  
Based on the information provided and the fact that TG[REDACTED] often presents with cyanosis and heart failure in the neonatal period, TG[REDACTED] is a likely diagnosis. However, a definitive diagnosis requires careful analysis of the chest X-ray and other clinical findings by a qualified medical professional.
