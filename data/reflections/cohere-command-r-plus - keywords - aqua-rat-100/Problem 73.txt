Solution: Let the total number of students be $x$. The number of students who took physics is $20\%$ of $x$, which is $0.2x$. The number of students who took math is $28\%$ of $x$, which is $0.28x$. The number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of these, $0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x$. The number of students who took neither subject is the remaining percentage, $100\% - 48\% = 52\%$, which is $0.52$ of $x$, or $0.52x$.

We are given that there are more than $501$ students in the school, so we can set up the following inequality: $0.52x > 501$. To solve for $x$, we divide by $0.52$, resulting in $x > 963.46$. Thus, the least possible number of students in the school is a value slightly greater than $963.46$. 

Since none of the answer choices represent a value slightly greater than $963.46$, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.
