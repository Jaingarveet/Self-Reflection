Solution: The rectangular solid has dimensions $3, 4$, and $15$. The diameter of the sphere is the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

$$\text{diameter} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{118} \approx 10.87$$

The correct answer is choice [REDACTED], approximately $15.81$.
