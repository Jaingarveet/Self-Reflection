Solution:
George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.
George can only give a report on Tuesday.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports.
Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on either Monday or Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
But George also gives a report on Tuesday, which violates the condition that only two reports can be given on each day.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
Since George also gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday.
