Solution:
1. Identify the articles and their topics: G, H, J (finance), Q, R, S (nutrition), Y (wildlife).
2. Analyze the constraints:
    - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
    - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
    - S must be earlier than Y.
    - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
3. Build a logical sequence:
    - G is fourth, so it cannot be the first or second article.
    - J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be the first or second article.
    - S must be earlier than Y, so S cannot be the fifth or sixth article.
    - Q is third, so it cannot be the second or fourth article.
    - H is not restricted by any other article, so it can be the first, second, fifth, or sixth article.
    - R is not restricted by any other article, so it can be the first, second, third, fifth, or sixth article.
    - Y is not restricted by any other article, so it can be the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth article.
4. Evaluate the answer choices:
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not possible.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not possible.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This is not possible.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible.
