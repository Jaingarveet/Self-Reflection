Solution:
1. Grain > Livestock > Textiles: This means Grain is in a higher numbered bay than Livestock, which is in a higher numbered bay than Textiles.
2. Produce > Fuel: Produce is in a higher numbered bay than Fuel.
3. Textiles is next to Produce: This means they are in adjacent bays.
4. Analyze bay 4: Since Textiles cannot be in bay 4 due to the adjacency requirement with Produce, and Produce cannot be in bay 4 due to the Produce > Fuel condition, the only remaining option for bay 4 is Grain.
5. Analyze bay 5: Since Grain is in bay 4, bay 5 must hold Livestock to satisfy the Grain > Livestock condition.
6. Analyze bay 6: Since Livestock is in bay 5, bay 6 must hold Textiles to satisfy the Livestock > Textiles condition.
7. Analyze bay 3: Since Textiles is in bay 6, bay 3 must hold Fuel to satisfy the Textiles is next to Produce condition.
8. Analyze bay 2: Since Fuel is in bay 3, bay 2 must hold Produce to satisfy the Produce > Fuel condition.
9. Analyze bay 1: Since Produce is in bay 2, bay 1 must hold Machinery.
