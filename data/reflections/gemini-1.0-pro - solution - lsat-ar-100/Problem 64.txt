Solution:
Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 2, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 3. This would satisfy all of the conditions.
If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 2, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 3. This would also satisfy all of the conditions.
If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1, and Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 2. This would also satisfy all of the conditions.
However, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, the scenario where Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3 is the most likely.
Therefore, the only statement that could be true is:
[REDACTED]
