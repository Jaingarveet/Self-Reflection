Solution:
1. Identify the scientists who are already selected: F, L, Q, and R.
2. Verify that at least one scientist of each type is selected: F (botanist), L (chemist), and Q (zoologist).
3. Apply the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since only one botanist (F) is selected, we can select another zoologist.
4. Apply the condition that F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected. [REDACTED] is not selected.
5. Apply the condition that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected. [REDACTED] is not selected.
6. Apply the condition that if [REDACTED] is selected, both [REDACTED] and R must be selected. Since [REDACTED] is not selected, [REDACTED] and R are not selected.
7. Identify the remaining scientists: [REDACTED] (botanist), [REDACTED] (chemist), and [REDACTED] (zoologist).
8. Choose the scientist who satisfies the remaining conditions: [REDACTED] (zoologist).
