Solution:
Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
Hong does not testify on Monday.
At least one witness testifies on Monday.
Based on these conditions, let's analyze each option:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible. Franco can testify on Monday, and the remaining four witnesses can be split between Tuesday and Wednesday, satisfying the conditions.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not possible. Franco and Iturbe cannot testify on the same day due to the condition that they cannot testify together.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible. Garcia and Hong can both testify on Tuesday, along with one other witness, while Franco and Iturbe can be split between Monday and Wednesday.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible. Garcia can testify on Monday, Hong and one other witness can testify on Wednesday, and Franco and Iturbe can be split between Tuesday and Wednesday.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not possible. If Jackson testifies on Tuesday, then only one witness can testify on Monday due to the condition that at least one witness must testify on Monday. This violates the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
