Solution:
The original constraint states: "If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne."
We need to find a constraint that has the same effect on the assignment of Jaramillo and Kayne.
Let's analyze each option:
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This is the converse of the original constraint. It's not logically equivalent because it restricts Kayne's assignment based on Jaramillo's, while the original restricts Jaramillo's based on Kayne's.
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This constraint is unrelated to the original constraint. It focuses on a different combination of candidates and doesn't influence the assignment of Jaramillo and Kayne.
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This is the contrapositive of the original constraint. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning it will have the same effect on the assignment. If Ong is not assigned, then the original constraint wouldn't restrict Kayne's assignment. Similarly, under this contrapositive, if Ong is not assigned, Kayne is free to be assigned to any country.
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This constraint is independent of the original constraint. It restricts the assignments of Jaramillo and Novetzke but doesn't influence whether Kayne needs to be assigned if Jaramillo is.
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" Similar to option [REDACTED], this constraint focuses on a different pair of candidates and doesn't influence the relationship between Jaramillo and Kayne's assignments.
Therefore, the only option that has the same effect as the original constraint is [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]"
