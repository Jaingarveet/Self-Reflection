Solution:
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give reports on the same day.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a morning report.
Therefore, George must give an afternoon report on Tuesday.
Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, one of them must give a morning report on Tuesday.
If Olivia gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Robert must give the afternoon report on Monday.
If Robert gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Olivia must give the afternoon report on Monday.
In either case, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday.
So the answer is [REDACTED].
