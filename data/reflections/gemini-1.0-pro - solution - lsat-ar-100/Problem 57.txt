Solution:
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Since Nina's report cannot be on Tuesday, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, if [REDACTED] give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.
