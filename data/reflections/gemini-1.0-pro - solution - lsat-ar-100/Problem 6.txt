Solution:
1. Identify the relative comparisons provided:
    - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
    - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
    - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
    - Exactly two students review the same plays.
2. Analyze the choices based on the relative comparisons:
    - [REDACTED]: Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    - [REDACTED]: Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang does. This MUST be true. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review at least one more play than Jiang.
    - [REDACTED]: Megregian reviews more plays than O'Neill does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    - [REDACTED]: O'Neill reviews more plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    - [REDACTED]: O'Neill reviews more plays than Kramer does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
