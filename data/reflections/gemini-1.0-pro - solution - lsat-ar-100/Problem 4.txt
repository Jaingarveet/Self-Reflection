Solution:
Lan cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day as [REDACTED].
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then she could lead a Thursday or Friday session, or she could still lead a Wednesday session.
If Lan leads a Thursday session, then [REDACTED] cannot lead a Thursday session.
If Lan leads a Friday session, then [REDACTED] can lead a Thursday session.
If Lan leads a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] can lead a Thursday session.
Therefore, if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then we cannot determine which lab assistant must lead a Thursday session.
