Solution:
Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
Therefore, Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Rottweilers are featured on days 1, 3, and 5.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
Newfoundlands are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Siamese are featured on days 3, 5, and 7.
Day 2 and day 6 cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy because Himalayans and Newfoundlands are featured on both days.
