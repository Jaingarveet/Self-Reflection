Solution:
1. Identify the given conditions:
    - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target if Solide's website target is 1 day.
2. Analyze the possible scenarios for each client's voicemail and website targets:
    - Image: Voicemail (1 or 2), Website (1, 2, or 3)
    - Solide: Voicemail (1 or 2), Website (1, 2, or 3)
    - Truvest: Voicemail (1 or 2), Website (1, 2, or 3)
3. Consider the condition that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days:
    - This eliminates the possibility of any client having a voicemail target of 3 days.
4. Evaluate each answer choice:
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible if Image's voicemail target is 1 or 2 days.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible if Solide's voicemail target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible if Solide's website target is 2 or 3 days.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible if Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days and Solide's website target is 1 day.
    - [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not necessarily true. Truvest's voicemail target could be 1 day if Solide's website target is 1 day.
