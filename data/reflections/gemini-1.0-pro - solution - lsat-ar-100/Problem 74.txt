Solution:
1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Now, let's consider each option:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This satisfies all constraints. [REDACTED] can be unassigned, and the remaining three candidates (Jaramillo, Landon, and Ong) can be assigned to the three ambassadorships without violating any constraints.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates constraint 2, as if Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates constraint 4, as Landon must be assigned to Zambia if assigned at all.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates constraint 1, as both [REDACTED] cannot be unassigned.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates constraint 3, as if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
Therefore, the only pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships could be [REDACTED].
