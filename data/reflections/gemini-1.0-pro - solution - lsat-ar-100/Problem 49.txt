Solution:
1. Pharmacy at one end, restaurant at the other:
    - This leaves 5 spaces in the middle for the remaining 5 businesses.
2. Restaurants separated by at least 2 businesses:
    - This means there must be at least 1 business between them, and they cannot be adjacent.
3. Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian:
    - This leaves 2 options for the pharmacy's placement.
4. Toy store not next to veterinarian:
    - This further restricts the placement options.
5. Consider all possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
