2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Let's analyze the choices:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates condition 1 as only two books are on the bottom shelf.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This satisfies all conditions. G and H are on the top shelf, I is on the middle shelf, K and O are on the bottom shelf, and F and M are on the bottom shelf.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates condition 4 as L and O are on the same shelf.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates condition 1 as only four books are on the bottom shelf.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates condition 3 as F and K are on the same shelf.
