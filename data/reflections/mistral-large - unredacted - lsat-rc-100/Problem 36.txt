Explanation:
I misinterpreted the objection raised by the critics in the second paragraph. The critics argue that the historical and social circumstances of a culture play an important role in the development of that culture's values, and that these circumstances should be taken into account when studying other cultures. They do not necessarily argue that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the objection raised by the critics
* Misunderstanding of the importance of historical and social circumstances in the development of a culture's values

Solution:
The critics in the second paragraph argue that the historical and social circumstances of a culture play an important role in the development of that culture's values. They claim that these circumstances should be taken into account when studying other cultures, and that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western and value-laden. Therefore, they would be most likely to agree with choice B.

Instructions:

1. Carefully read the objection raised by the critics in the second paragraph.
2. Identify the main argument of the critics.
3. Consider the importance of historical and social circumstances in the development of a culture's values.

* Carefully read and consider the objection raised by the critics.
* Pay attention to the importance of historical and social circumstances in the development of a culture's values.
* Evaluate each answer choice in light of the main argument of the critics.
* Do not make assumptions about the critics' argument based on your own beliefs or values.
