Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the specific example of Mexican American communities and overlooked the broader definition of proverbs provided in the passage.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the content of the passage but in identifying the most strongly implied statement.
I misinterpreted the question and failed to recognize that the correct answer was a general statement about proverbs, not a specific statement about Mexican American communities.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Overlooking the broader definition of proverbs
 - Focusing too much on specific examples
Solution:
The passage defines a proverb as a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom.
The passage also states that each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.
Therefore, the statement that is most strongly implied by the passage is "D: There are some sayings that do not require a verbal context to be understood but whose meaning for each particular use depends on the social context in which that use occurs."
