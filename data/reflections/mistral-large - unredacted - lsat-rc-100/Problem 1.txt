Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the objection raised by the proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph. I thought they objected to the use of Western scientific methods to investigate nonscientific cultures, but they actually objected to the use of one society's literary theories to criticize the literature of a society that has different values.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of the objection
 - Misinterpretation of the passage
 - Incorrect identification of the objectionable study

Solution:
The proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph argue that it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved. Therefore, they would most likely object to a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values.

Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully to understand the objection raised by the proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.
2. Identify the study that is most likely to be considered objectionable by the proponents of this version of multicultural education.
3. Eliminate the answer choices that do not match the objection raised by the proponents.
4. Choose the answer that best matches the objection raised by the proponents.

Advice:
 - Always read the passage carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the objection raised by the proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the passage.
 - Always eliminate the answer choices that do not match the objection raised by the proponents.
 - Always choose the answer that best matches the objection raised by the proponents.
 - Never rush to answer the question without fully understanding the objection raised by the proponents.
