  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the question and the choices, I realize that the correct answer is indeed A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.

The question asks which choice is most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency between the survey's findings and the experts' beliefs. Choice A addresses this inconsistency by suggesting that even though drunk driving is strictly investigated in some cities, severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents. This means that the stricter enforcement of drunk driving laws has not necessarily led to a reduction in traffic accidents, which aligns with the survey's findings.

The other choices do not address the inconsistency between the survey's findings and the experts' beliefs. Choice B, the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving, does not explain why the stricter enforcement has not led to a reduction in traffic accidents. Choice C, it is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management, suggests that improving drivers' awareness is more important than strict enforcement, but it does not address the inconsistency. Choice D, in addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped, is not relevant to the inconsistency between the survey's findings and the experts' beliefs.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
