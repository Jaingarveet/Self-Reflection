  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After re-evaluating the question, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect. Let's analyze the given choices again:

A: This choice violates condition (2) as F and G are in the same department.

B: This choice violates condition (3) as X is in the sales department, but W is not in the production department.

C: This choice satisfies all the given conditions:

* H and Y are in the same department (Public Relations Department).
* F and G are not in the same department (F is in Production, and G is in Sales).
* X is in the Sales Department, and W is in the Production Department.

D: This choice satisfies all the given conditions:

* H and Y are in the same department (Public Relations Department).
* F and G are not in the same department (F is in Production, and G is in Sales).
* X is in the Sales Department, and W is in the Production Department.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this answer is helpful.
