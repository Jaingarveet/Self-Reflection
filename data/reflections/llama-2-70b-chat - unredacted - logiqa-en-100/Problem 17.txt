  The correct answer is indeed A: After the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is put into use, the running cost is one-third of the steel armored vehicle with the same performance.

The initial statement suggests that the manufacturing cost of an aluminum alloy armored vehicle is twice that of a steel armored vehicle, making it less advisable from a financial point of view. However, choice A reveals that the running cost of the aluminum alloy armored vehicle is significantly lower than that of the steel armored vehicle, which was not considered in the initial statement. This lower running cost could potentially offset the higher manufacturing cost, making the aluminum alloy armored vehicle a more cost-effective option in the long run. Therefore, choice A raises doubts about the conclusion that it is not advisable to replace steel armored vehicles with aluminum alloy armored vehicles with the same protective properties.
