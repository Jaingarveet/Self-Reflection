  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Liu Xiang's victory and statement actually support the assertion that most track and field champions are black athletes. His statement, "Black athletes have been monopolizing this project for many years," acknowledges the dominance of black athletes in the sport. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

The error in the previous response was due to a misunderstanding of the question. The question asked for the assertion that Liu Xiang's victory and statement do not refute, but the previous response incorrectly identified the assertion that Liu Xiang's victory and statement actually support.
