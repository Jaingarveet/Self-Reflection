  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the problem, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is indeed D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.

Here's my reasoning:

From the given information, we know that Li was hired by Tianshu, Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit, and Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was also hired by Tianxuan.

From the options, we can see that option D states that only Wang was hired by Tianxuan, which is consistent with the given information. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because Li and Liu were not hired by the same unit, according to the given information.

Option B is incorrect because Wang, Zhao, and Liu were not all hired by Tianji, according to the given information.

Option C is incorrect because it is possible that both Wang and Zhang were hired by Tianxuan, according to the given information.

I hope this clears up any confusion, and I apologize again for the mistake in my previous response.
