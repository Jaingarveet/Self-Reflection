Professor Qian's statement eliminates the Tsinghua University team but implies that the University of Science and Technology of China team will win. 
Professor Sun's statement eliminates the China University of Science and Technology team and implies that the Tsinghua University team will win. 
Since only one of the professors made a correct judgment, the winner must be the Tsinghua University team, as eliminated by Professor Zhao's statement.
