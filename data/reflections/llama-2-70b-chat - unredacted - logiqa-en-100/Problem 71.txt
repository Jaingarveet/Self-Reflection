  Explanation:
The seemingly contradictory phenomenon can be explained by the fact that while 63% of respondents favor college students as nannies, nearly 60% said "no" when asked if they would ask college students to be nannies. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that among those who favor college students as nannies, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services. This suggests that while respondents may favor college students as nannies, they do not necessarily believe that college students are the best choice for housekeeping services. Therefore, choice C is the best answer.
