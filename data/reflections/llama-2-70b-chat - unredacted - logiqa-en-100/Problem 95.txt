  I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the question and options, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The correct answer is indeed D: Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high.

Premier Wen Jiabao's statement is a metaphorical expression, suggesting that when a large number of people work together, even a small task can become significant. The phrase "everyone collects firewood and the flame is high" is a Chinese idiom that means when many people work together, they can achieve great things.

Option D is the best match for the statement given by Premier Wen Jiabao, as it conveys a similar message about the power of collective effort.

Option A is not related to the statement given by Premier Wen Jiabao.

Option B is incorrect because it focuses on the complexity and difficulty of managing a large population, rather than the collective power of the people.

Option C is also incorrect because it states that China cannot threaten any other country, which is not related to the idea of collective effort.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high.
