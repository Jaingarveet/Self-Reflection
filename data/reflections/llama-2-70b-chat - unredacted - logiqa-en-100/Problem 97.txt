  The correct answer is D: The online forum is a legal forum.

The fact that the online forum is a legal forum suggests that it is a legitimate platform for people to express their opinions and ideas. If the forum is legal, it is likely that the posts published on it are also legal and not necessarily indicative of a deteriorating social atmosphere.

This choice weakens the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating because it suggests that the observed increase in certain types of posts may be due to the fact that people feel comfortable expressing themselves on a legal platform, rather than a decrease in societal standards.

In contrast, choice B, The number of Internet users has quadrupled in the past 5 years, does not necessarily weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating. While it is true that an increase in the number of Internet users may account for some of the observed increase in certain types of posts, it does not necessarily explain why those posts are becoming more prevalent. The increase in posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people, for example, may still indicate a deterioration of societal values, even if there are more people posting overall.

Choices A and C do not weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating. Choice A, "Good things don't go out, bad things spread thousands of miles," is a proverb that suggests that negative things tend to spread more quickly and widely than positive things, which may still be true even if the number of Internet users has increased. Choice C, In recent years, some people have used rumors online to achieve profit-making purposes, does not necessarily weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating, as it may suggest that people are using the internet for nefarious purposes, which could still indicate a decline in societal values.
