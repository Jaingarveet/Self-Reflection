Instructions:
1. Identify the metabolic pathway in question (glycolysis).
2. Determine whether the conditions are aerobic or anaerobic.
3. Recall the net production of ATP in glycolysis ([REDACTED]).
4. Identify the steps in glycolysis where NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
5. In anaerobic conditions, remember that NADH must be oxidized back to NAD+ to continue glycolysis.
6. Recognize that the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ is coupled with the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.
7. Conclude that the end products in anaerobic glycolysis are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
