Instructions:
1. Recognize that desquamation is a common side effect of radiation therapy.
2. Assess the severity of the desquamation.
3. For mild cases, choose observation alone as the appropriate management.
4. Reserve more aggressive treatments for severe cases or those with signs of infection.
5. Remember that most cases of radiation-induced desquamation are self-limited and do not require intervention.
