Instructions:
1. Identify the patient's main complaint and relate it to the possible underlying cause.
2. Review the functions of the cranial nerves involved in swallowing and airway protection.
3. Consider the specific roles of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in the swallowing process and laryngeal function.
4. Evaluate the presence or absence of additional symptoms, such as voice changes, to help differentiate between possible nerve injuries.
5. Select the nerve whose injury best explains the patient's symptoms and presentation.
