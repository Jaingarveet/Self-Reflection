Instructions:
1. Carefully assess the location and extent of disease to determine the lung cancer stage.
2. Consider surgery as the primary treatment if the tumor is localized to the lung without distant metastases.
3. Remember that separate tumor nodules in the same lung may still be resectable and should not automatically rule out surgery.
4. Evaluate the patient's overall health and lung function to determine if they can tolerate surgery.
5. Recommend adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation after surgery to reduce recurrence risk.
