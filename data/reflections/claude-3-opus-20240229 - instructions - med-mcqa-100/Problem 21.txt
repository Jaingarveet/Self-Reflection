Instructions:
1. Identify the key terms in the question (senescent RBCs, malaria types).
2. Recall the specific red blood cell preferences of each malaria parasite species:
   - P. malariae (quartan malaria) prefers senescent RBCs
   - P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. ovale prefer younger RBCs
3. Select the malaria type that matches the red blood cell preference mentioned in the question.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the specific parasite-host cell association.
