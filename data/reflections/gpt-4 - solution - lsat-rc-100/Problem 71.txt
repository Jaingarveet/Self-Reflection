Solution:
The author of passage [REDACTED] criticizes the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by the desire to propagate one's genes. However, the author also argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a given behavior, and that it is a mistake to assume that a behavior is only reasonable if it serves the interest of gene propagation. This criticism aligns with choice [REDACTED], which suggests that to explain a behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.
