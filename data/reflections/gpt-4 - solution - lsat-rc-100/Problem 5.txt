Solution:
The passage presents three positions on the role of art and literature. The first two positions are briefly described, while the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's, is elaborated in detail. The passage primarily differentiates Dostoyevsky's view from the second position, the radical critics' view, by discussing Dostoyevsky's disagreement with their insistence on art's utility and their understanding of reality.
