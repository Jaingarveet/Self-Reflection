Solution:
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that no writer had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz. This assertion would be most called into question if it were true that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, depending on whether or not it is read aloud. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
