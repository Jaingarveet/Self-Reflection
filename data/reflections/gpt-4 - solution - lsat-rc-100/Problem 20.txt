Solution:
The author's attitude towards the twofold obligation of defense lawyers (to the defendant and to the court/society) is that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. The author believes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, nor should they try to prove the innocence of a client they believe to be guilty. Instead, they should present the case in the client's favor as much as possible, while also considering the facts on the other side and arguing for leniency if they believe it is warranted. This suggests that the author is convinced that the twofold obligation does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers.
