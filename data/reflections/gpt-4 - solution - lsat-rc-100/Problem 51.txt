Solution:
The sentences at lines 28-31 argue that lawyers should not deny a client's guilt if they know it to be true, but should instead argue for leniency. The sentences at lines 7-11 argue that lawyers should not judge defendants, but should instead provide the best defense possible. These two positions are not unrelated or equivalent, nor is one a hypothetical situation supporting the other. Instead, they represent different perspectives on the role of a defense lawyer, with the later sentences opposing the earlier ones on the specifics of how a lawyer should handle a case when they believe their client is guilty. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
