Solution:
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the process where life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators. This suggests that the work was originally created by a member of one culture (Native American) but was then translated, recorded, and edited by a member of another culture (non-Native American). However, the key point is that the original content was based on oral communication by a member of another culture, which makes option [REDACTED] the correct answer.
