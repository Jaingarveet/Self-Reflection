Solution:
The author's connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the idea that larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses, driving smaller firms out of business. This leads to an industry being dominated by a few players, creating a monopoly. 
Choice [REDACTED] undermines this connection by suggesting that if a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover. This implies that increased size and specialization do not necessarily lead to lower costs and monopoly power.
