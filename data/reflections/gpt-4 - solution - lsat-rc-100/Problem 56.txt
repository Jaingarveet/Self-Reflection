Solution:
The reference to railroads is used to illustrate an industry that demonstrates the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand. Railroads, like the pin factory, benefit from increasing returns because the larger the operation, the more efficient it becomes. This contradicts the Invisible Hand theory, which assumes diminishing returns and requires many competitors in each industry.
