Explanation:
The authors of Passage [REDACTED] and Passage [REDACTED] would likely disagree on the issue of [REDACTED]. Passage [REDACTED] asserts that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability, suggesting that it should be considered a scientific law. On the other hand, Passage [REDACTED] argues that there are no objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, casting doubt on its reliability and suitability for scientific law status.

Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are not correct because they do not accurately reflect a point of disagreement between the two passages. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because both passages agree that uniformity in training is desirable. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because Passage [REDACTED] suggests that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and is reliable, while Passage [REDACTED] argues that there are no objective standards for evaluation, but does not directly address the status of scientific law. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because both passages mention that different agencies have different requirements for correlation before permitting a positive identification, but this is not the main point of disagreement between the two passages. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because both passages acknowledge that fingerprint examiners can make mistakes, but they differ on the likelihood of such mistakes and the implications for the reliability of fingerprint identification.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED], which accurately reflects the disagreement between the two passages regarding the status of fingerprint identification as a scientific law.
