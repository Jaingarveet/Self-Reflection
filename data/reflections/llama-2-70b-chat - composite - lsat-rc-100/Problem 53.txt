Explanation:
The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. It is an impulsive and emotional reaction to a perceived injustice, rather than a calculated decision based on a cost-benefit analysis of potential outcomes. The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected overall satisfaction or utility, but physically assaulting someone is unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the worker, and could lead to negative consequences such as legal troubles, damage to his reputation, and further strained relationships with his former employer and colleagues.

The other options can be described as rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives:

[REDACTED]: The waiter's decision to conceal his tip income to reduce his taxes is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding taxes.

[REDACTED]: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding is a rational response to the economic disincentive of a speeding ticket and the potential loss of her driver's license.

[REDACTED]: The industrialist's decision to illegally discharge the pollutant is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding the cost of treatment, even though it is illegal.

[REDACTED]: The government official's decision to risk prosecution for soliciting bribes is a rational response to the economic disincentive of a low government salary in the face of rampant inflation.

Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
