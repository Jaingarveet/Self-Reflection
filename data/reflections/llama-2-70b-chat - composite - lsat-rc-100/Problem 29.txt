Explanation:
The passage states that the physics community during the 1930s never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, despite numerous experiments that produced puzzling radioactive substances. The community was hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, and they were also limited by their expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. It wasn't until Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations that the physics community realized that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer, as the passage does not mention the physics community recognizing the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
