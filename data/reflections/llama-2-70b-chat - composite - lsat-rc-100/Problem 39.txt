Explanation:
The passage suggests that the market system has a democratizing effect on technology, making it accessible to a wider range of people over time. The author notes that while profits from technological developments may initially accrue to a small group of people, the drive to expand markets and lower prices leads to increased accessibility for a larger share of the population. Therefore, option [REDACTED], "Often the desire of some people for profits motivates changes that are beneficial for large numbers of other people," aligns with the author's perspective.

The other options do not accurately reflect the author's views:

[REDACTED]: The passage does not mention anything about the distribution of profits from computer technology compared to other technological developments.

[REDACTED]: While the passage mentions that technology can extend beyond national boundaries, it does not explicitly state that national boundaries are not barriers to the democratizing spread of technology.

[REDACTED]: The passage does not discuss the riskiness of investing in technology compared to other investments.

[REDACTED]: The passage does not mention how greater geographical mobility of populations affects the profits of entrepreneurs and investors in technology.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
