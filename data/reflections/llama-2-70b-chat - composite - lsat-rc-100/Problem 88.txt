Explanation:
The passage states that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility that atoms might be split, and that their research was hampered by their expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, option [REDACTED], "The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products," would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Without preconceived notions about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, the physicists would have been more open to considering alternative explanations for the data they were collecting, including the possibility of nuclear fission. This would have allowed them to recognize the significance of the evidence more quickly and come to the conclusion that atoms were being split sooner.

The other options do not address the key issue of the physicists' expectations and preconceptions, and therefore would not have had the same impact on the amount of time it took for them to realize that atoms were being split.
