Explanation:
The author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work is best captured by the statement "[REDACTED]." The author notes that Lichtenstein's work possesses an "inner sweetness" and a "faith in reconciliation" between parody and true feeling, and that it reflects contemporary life while also displaying a deliberate naivete. The author does not express enthusiasm for the work's rebellious aspects (choice A), nor does he show [REDACTED] (choice B). While the author notes that Lichtenstein's work rejects abstract expressionism (choice C), this is not the primary focus of the author's attitude toward the work. Finally, the author does not explicitly express admiration for the work's subtle critique of contemporary culture (choice D). Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.
