Explanation:
Passage [REDACTED] suggests that "capricious enforcement" refers to a situation where a law enforcement agency exercises its discretion in enforcing the law in an arbitrary or unpredictable manner, without following the intent of the legislature. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.

In Passage [REDACTED], the author notes that law enforcement agencies have the power to decline to prosecute violators of the law, and that this power is frequently exercised. The author also explains that laws are often overinclusive, meaning that they prohibit some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid. The author suggests that enforcing such laws to the letter would be overly costly and could result in punishing innocent people. Instead, the author proposes a technique called "discretionary nonenforcement" to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.

Therefore, option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," best captures the idea of capricious enforcement described in Passage [REDACTED].

It's worth noting that the other options do not accurately describe the concept of capricious enforcement discussed in Passage [REDACTED]. Option [REDACTED] refers to [REDACTED], which is not necessarily arbitrary or unpredictable. Option [REDACTED] refers to enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent, which is the opposite of capricious enforcement. Option [REDACTED] prioritizes enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes, which may be a factor in law enforcement decisions, but it is not the same as capricious enforcement. Option [REDACTED] refers to [REDACTED], which may contribute to capricious enforcement, but it is not the same as not following the intent of the legislature.
