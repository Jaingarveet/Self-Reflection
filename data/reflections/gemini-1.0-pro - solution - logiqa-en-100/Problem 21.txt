Solution:
Xiao Chen argues that the flickering light of Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before.
Xiao Wang counters that comets far away from the sun are not normally observed, and the flickering light was discovered through careful tracking observation.
Xiao Wang is directly refuting Xiao Chen's claim about the lack of evidence. By pointing out that the flickering light was only observed through careful tracking, Xiao Wang is suggesting that the lack of previous observations is not a valid reason to conclude that the flickering light is unusual.
