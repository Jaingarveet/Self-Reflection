Solution:
1. X and F are assigned to the same department (production).
2. F must be allocated in the production department (already satisfied by step 1).
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department (not applicable in this case as X is not in sales).
4. H and Y must be allocated in the same department. This condition is not affected by X and F being in production.
5. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. This condition is also not affected by X and F being in production.
Based on these conditions, let's re-analyze the choices:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This could be true. G and F can be in different departments, and there is no restriction on G being in sales.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could also be true. H and Y can be in any department other than production (to satisfy condition 5), including the public relations department.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could be true as well. There is no restriction on I's department based on the given information.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This could be true. Even though X and F are in production, condition 3 does not apply in this case, and W can be in any department, including public relations.
Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is still:
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
