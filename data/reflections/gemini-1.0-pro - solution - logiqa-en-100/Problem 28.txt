Solution:
1. E or F, but not both: This means either E or F will be selected, but not both.
2. J or K, but not both: This means either J or K will be selected, but not both.
3. If J, then G: This means if J is selected, then G must also be selected.
4. Unless F, then not M: This means if F is not selected, then M cannot be selected. This is equivalent to "If F, then M".
5. Analyze the choices based on the corrected conditions.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates condition 1, as both F and E are selected.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This satisfies all conditions. If J is selected, then G is also selected (condition 3). If F is not selected (condition 4), then M cannot be selected.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This violates condition 4, as F is not selected and M is selected.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]: This satisfies all conditions. If F is selected (condition 4), then M can be selected.
