Solution:
The premises state that the microorganism usually breeds above freezing and the lake water has frozen.
This suggests that the microorganism is unlikely to reproduce now.
However, it is possible that the microorganism could still reproduce, even though it is unlikely.
Therefore, the conclusion is highly likely to be true, but it may also be false.
