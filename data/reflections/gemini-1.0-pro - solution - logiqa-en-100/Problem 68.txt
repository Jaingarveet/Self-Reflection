Solution:
The argument states that whether a person does good behavior or bad behavior depends on the length of his life. 
The argument then concludes that if a person only lived one day, it would be best for him to steal other people's things because he would not suffer the fear of being caught. 
However, this conclusion is only valid if the person can know exactly how long he can live. 
If the person cannot know how long he can live, then he may choose to do good behavior even if he knows he will only live for a few days.
