Solution:
The economist's hypothesis is that transferring polluting industries from developed countries to developing countries would benefit both sides.
This hypothesis is based on the assumption that developed countries would benefit from the improvement of the natural environment, while developing countries would be compensated for the environmental pollution by solving employment and increasing taxes.
This hypothesis implies that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries.
