Solution:
1. The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3. The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department.
4. The human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department.
Based on the information provided, we can eliminate options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
Option [REDACTED]: If the sales department is on the upper level of the R&[REDACTED] department, then the human resources department and the sales department would be adjacent, which contradicts statement 1.
Option [REDACTED]: If the sales department is on the second floor, then the human resources department and the sales department would be adjacent, which contradicts statement 1.
Option [REDACTED]: If the sales department is at the next level of the planning department, then the human resources department would be at the upper level of the administration department, which contradicts statement 4.
Therefore, the only option that remains is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This satisfies all the constraints and is a valid possibility.
