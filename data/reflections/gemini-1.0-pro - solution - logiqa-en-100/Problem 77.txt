Solution:
The printing group has only three members, G, H, and L.
The binding group must have at least 3 members.
F and K cannot be in the same group.
If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
At least one of the same employees in both groups.
To minimize the number of members in the binding group, we can have M, J, and K in both groups. This satisfies all the conditions and results in a binding group with 3 members and a printing group with 3 members.
