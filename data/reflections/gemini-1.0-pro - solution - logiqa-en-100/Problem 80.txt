Solution:
(1) The two floors of the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent;
(2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department;
(3) The floor of the administrative department is above the planning department, but in the manpower Below the Resources Department.
From (2), we know that the finance department is not on the first floor.
From (3), we know that the administrative department is not on the first floor or the sixth floor.
From (1), we know that the human resources department and the sales department are not on adjacent floors.
Therefore, the possible arrangements are:
- First floor: Finance Department
Second floor: Planning Department
Third floor: Administration Department
Fourth floor: Human Resources Department
Fifth floor: R & [REDACTED] Department
Sixth floor: Sales Department
- First floor: Finance Department
Second floor: Planning Department
Third floor: R & [REDACTED] Department
Fourth floor: Administration Department
Fifth floor: Human Resources Department
Sixth floor: Sales Department
We need to consider both possibilities.
