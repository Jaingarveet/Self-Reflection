Solution:
1. The team did not go to I Peak.
2. According to rule (4), if the team did not go to I Peak, they could not go to Lake J.
3. According to rule (1), the team must visit at least one of Lake G and Lake J. Since they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit Lake G.
4. According to rule (2), if the team did not go to E city or F city, they could not go to G lake. Since they visited G lake, they must have gone to either E city or F city.
5. The team could have visited both E city and F city, satisfying rule (2) and allowing them to visit G lake.
6. Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that the team went to F city and G lake.
