Solution:
1. At least one person of Bingding is selected.
2. If E is selected, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are also selected.
3. [REDACTED] maximum of 2 people are selected.
The rules apply to the final selection of four, not the initial identification of five candidates.
Therefore, Ding must be in the fourth because of rule 1 (at least one person of Bingding is selected).
