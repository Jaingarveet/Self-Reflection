Solution:
F and M are not in charge of the same department.
F and G are not in charge of the same department.
H and I are not in charge of the same department.
There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
Since F and M are not in charge of the same department, and there is only one assistant in charge of three departments, then either F or M must be the assistant in charge of three departments.
If F is in charge of three departments, then G, H, and I must each be in charge of one department. Since F and G cannot be in charge of the same department, G must be in charge of a different department than F. This leaves H and I to be in charge of the remaining two departments. Since H and I cannot be in charge of the same department, they must be in charge of different departments. Therefore, if F is in charge of three departments, then I and P must be in charge of the same department.
If M is in charge of three departments, then F, G, and H must each be in charge of one department. Since F and M cannot be in charge of the same department, F must be in charge of a different department than M. This leaves G and H to be in charge of the remaining two departments. Since F and G cannot be in charge of the same department, G must be in charge of a different department than F. This leaves H to be in charge of the remaining department. Therefore, if M is in charge of three departments, then I and P must be in charge of the same department.
