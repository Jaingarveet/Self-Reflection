Solution:
Robot 1 picked up the red squares instead of the red balls, so it cannot recognize colors and therefore cannot be type [REDACTED].
Robot 2 picked up the blue balls instead of the red balls, so it cannot recognize shapes and therefore cannot be type [REDACTED].
Therefore, both robots must be either type [REDACTED] or another type that does not recognize colors or shapes.
