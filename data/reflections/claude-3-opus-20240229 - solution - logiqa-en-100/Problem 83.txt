Solution:
Given:
- Either E or F will participate, but not both. 
- Either J or K will participate, but not both.
- If J participates, then G must also participate.
- M will only participate if F participates. 
- H is not participating.
If H does not participate, that leaves 3 spots remaining.
We know one spot must go to either E or F. Let's consider each case:
Case 1: E participates
- If E participates, F cannot. 
- If F does not participate, then M cannot participate either.
- That leaves 2 spots for J, K, and G.
- We know J and K cannot both participate. 
- If J participates, G must also participate, filling the 2 spots.
- If K participates, G may or may not participate. 
- There is no definite answer in this case.
Case 2: F participates 
- If F participates, E cannot.
- If F participates, M must also participate. That fills 2 spots.
- There is 1 spot left for either J or K.
- If J takes the last spot, G must also participate. But there are no spots left, so this is impossible.
- Therefore, K must take the last spot.
In Case 2, we see that if H does not participate, and F does participate, then the 3 remaining spots must be filled by F, M, and K. 
G cannot participate in this scenario because there is no room if J participates, and J must participate for G to participate.
Therefore, if H does not participate, [REDACTED] must both be included.
