Solution:
1. Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients. The male patients are E, F, and J.
2. J is a child patient, so if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat an adult male patient.
3. There are only two adult male patients: E and F.
4. Therefore, Dr. Zhang must treat J (the child male patient) and either E or F (an adult male patient).
5. There is no other possible assignment for Dr. Zhang given the constraints.
6. Thus, it must be true that J is treated by Dr. Zhang.
