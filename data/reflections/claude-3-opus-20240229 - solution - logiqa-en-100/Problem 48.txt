Solution:
The given context states that Chinese buyers have become the second-largest group of foreign buyers of US real estate, with a significant increase in transaction volume compared to previous years. Some people argue that this indicates more wealthy Chinese transferring their assets abroad.
Option B provides the best counterargument by suggesting that the increased investment could be driven by real estate speculation among wealthy Chinese in Beijing and Shanghai. This alternative explanation weakens the argument that the increased investment necessarily means a transfer of assets abroad.
