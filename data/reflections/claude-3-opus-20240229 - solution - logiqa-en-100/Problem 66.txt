Solution:
1. G is the northernmost island.
[REDACTED]. F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H. So the arrangement of F and H is fixed as: F - H
[REDACTED]. I and E are adjacent, but their relative positions can vary. There are two possible arrangements: I - E and E - I
[REDACTED]. The I-E or E-I pair can be placed either north or south of the F-H pair.
[REDACTED]. Considering all the possibilities, we have the following [REDACTED] arrangements:
   - G - I - E - F - H
   - G - E - I - F - H
   - G - F - H - I - E
   - G - F - H - E - I
6. Therefore, there are [REDACTED] possible arrangements in total.
