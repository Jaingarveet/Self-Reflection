Solution:
Xiao Chen argues that since the flickering of Comet 1996D3 far from the sun has not been observed before, it must be an unusual occurrence. 
Xiao Wang counters by saying that people don't normally observe distant comets, and this flickering was only discovered through continuous, careful tracking. 
Xiao Wang is pointing out that Xiao Chen's argument jumps to a conclusion and lacks persuasion. Just because something hasn't been observed before doesn't mean it's necessarily unusual - it could simply be due to lack of sufficient observation in the past.
Therefore, Xiao Wang's refutation focuses on exposing the weakness and lack of persuasion in Xiao Chen's line of reasoning, not on providing an alternative explanation.
