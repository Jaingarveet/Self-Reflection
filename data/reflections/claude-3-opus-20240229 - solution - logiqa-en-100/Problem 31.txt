Solution:
Let's re-evaluate each choice to determine if it allows the given opinion to be questioned:
[REDACTED]: The fact that grass in Xilin Gol grassland has significantly decreased in height over time supports the idea that grassland degradation has occurred, which is consistent with the opinion. This choice does not question the opinion.
[REDACTED]: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia and the thriving grasslands in Mongolia suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible for the degradation. This choice questions the opinion.
[REDACTED]: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.
[REDACTED]: This choice directly states that human factors are the main causes of increased dust storms, questioning the opinion that they are inevitable natural disasters caused by climate drought.
Therefore, choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] allow the given opinion to be questioned, while choice [REDACTED] supports the opinion.
