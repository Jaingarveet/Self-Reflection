Solution:
The survey showed that 63% of respondents favored college students as nannies, but nearly 60% said they would not hire a college student as a nanny.
This seems contradictory on the surface. 
Choice [REDACTED] states that among those who favor college students as nannies, 69% think it's good for the students, while only 31% think the students would provide better service.
This suggests that people's reason for favoring student nannies is not based on expecting superior housekeeping. 
Instead, they seem to favor the idea because they believe the experience is valuable for the students.
However, when considering their own needs, this belief is not enough to persuade them to actually hire a student.
They may prefer to hire nannies with more experience or availability, even if they generally like the idea of students working as nannies for their own growth and development.
Therefore, choice [REDACTED] reveals an underlying motivation that explains the seemingly contradictory survey results.
