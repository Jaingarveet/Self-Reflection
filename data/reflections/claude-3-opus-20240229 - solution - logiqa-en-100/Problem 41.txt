Solution:
Given:
- Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy.
- If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve a 20% increase.
Analyzing the answer choices:
[REDACTED]. If Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, it will go bankrupt. - This must be true. If Green Island can achieve a 10% increase, it can also achieve a 20% increase. Therefore, if it cannot achieve a 20% increase, it cannot achieve a 10% increase either, leading to bankruptcy.
[REDACTED]. If Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt. - While this is likely true, it is not a necessary conclusion based on the given information.
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED] - The statement does not provide information about what happens if the market does not change.
[REDACTED]. Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve a 20% increase. - This contradicts the given information, which states that a 10% increase implies a 20% increase is possible.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
