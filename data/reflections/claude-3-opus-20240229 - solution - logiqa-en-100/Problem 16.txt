Solution:
The economist's argument can be summarized as follows:
1. Transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries benefits both sides:
   - Developed countries gain from improved natural environment
   - Developing countries are compensated with increased employment and taxes
2. This leads to an increase in total global welfare.
For this argument to hold, the economist must assume that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than in developing countries (Choice A). This assumption is necessary to justify the claim that the transfer leads to an overall improvement, despite the pollution in developing countries.
The other choices, while potentially relevant, are not necessary assumptions for the economist's specific argument.
