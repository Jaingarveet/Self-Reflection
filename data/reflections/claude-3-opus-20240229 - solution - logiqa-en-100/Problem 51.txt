Solution:
1. Given that F must be in production (condition 4), and X is in the same department as F, we know that X, F, and W are all in production (condition 3).
2. This leaves G, H, I, and Y to be distributed among sales and public relations.
3. H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1), so they will fill 2 of the 3 spots in either sales or public relations.
4. F and G cannot be in the same department (condition 2), and F is in production, so G must be in either sales or public relations.
5. If H and Y are in sales, then G and I must be in public relations (as G cannot be with H and Y). But this is impossible as there is only one spot in public relations.
6. Therefore, H and Y must be in public relations, and G and I must be in sales.
7. So the statement "H is assigned to the production department" cannot be true.
