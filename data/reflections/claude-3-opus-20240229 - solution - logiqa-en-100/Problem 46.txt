Solution:
1. From condition (4), F must be in production.
2. From condition (2), since F is in production, G cannot be in production. So G must be in either sales or public relations.
3. From condition (1), H and Y must be in the same department.
4. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. 
   - This means that if X is in sales, H and Y cannot be in production (because W would be the 3rd person in production, leaving no room for H and Y).
   - It also means that if X is in sales, H and Y must be in public relations (because they can't be in production or sales).
5. So if X is in sales:
   - W must be in production
   - H and Y must be in public relations
   - F is in production
   - This leaves only I and G for the remaining 2 sales spots and 1 production spot.
6. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together. If X is in sales, G must be in the remaining production spot.
7. Looking at the other choices:
   - [REDACTED] could be in sales together (if X is not in sales)
   - [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together (because H and Y must be together, and if they're in sales, G must be in PR)
   - [REDACTED] could be in sales together (if X is not in sales)
Therefore, the pair that cannot be in sales together is [REDACTED].
