Solution:
1. Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.
2. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are both doctors.
3. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are the same height.
4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall.
5. Since [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall, and they are different heights from [REDACTED], it means [REDACTED] must be tall.
6. [REDACTED] is a doctor but not tall, so he can't meet all the requirements.
7. [REDACTED] is a doctor and must be tall (because there are 3 tall men, and [REDACTED] is tall, and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall).
8. Since there is only one handsome man among the four, and [REDACTED] is the only one who is known to be both tall and a doctor, he must be the handsome one.
Therefore, [REDACTED] meets all the requirements of Li Na.
