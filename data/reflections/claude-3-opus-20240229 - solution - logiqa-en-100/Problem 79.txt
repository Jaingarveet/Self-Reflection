Solution:
Let's reconsider each choice in light of the original argument:
[REDACTED]: Poses a valid doubt by highlighting the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence to prove the external world. 
[REDACTED]: Raises a valid question about proving others have similar experiences, casting doubt on that aspect of the argument.
[REDACTED]: Points out that if visual experience is reliable, then mirages would be real. This challenges the reliability of visual experience, a key part of the original argument. So this is a relevant doubt.
[REDACTED]: Argues that science's practical successes suggest there is a real external world that science reflects. This supports the original argument rather than challenging it.
Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the one that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument.
