Solution:
Given: H is in Team 2
1. Condition (6) applies: If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
2. Only choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] have Q in the middle of Team 1, so [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] can be eliminated.
3. Check conditions (3), (4), and (5) for choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]:
   Choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
   - Condition (3) is satisfied as L is in team 1.
   - Condition (4) is satisfied as neither P nor K are in the same team as N.
   - Condition (5) is satisfied as P is not involved.
   Choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
   - Condition (3) is satisfied as L is in team 1.
   - Condition (1) is violated as G is not in the front position.
   - Conditions (4) and (5) are satisfied as neither P, K, nor N are involved.
4. Therefore, Choice [REDACTED] satisfies all the relevant conditions and is the correct answer.
