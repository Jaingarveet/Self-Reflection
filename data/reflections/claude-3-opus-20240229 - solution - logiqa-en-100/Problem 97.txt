Solution:
The argument concludes that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating based on an increase in certain types of posts on an online forum. However, the fact that the online forum is described as a "legal forum" in choice [REDACTED] is significant. [REDACTED] legal forum would be expected to operate within the bounds of the law and have moderation to prevent truly harmful or illegal content. 
The presence of increased posts about topics like "evildoing" on a legal, moderated forum suggests these discussions are likely not as severe as the argument implies. If the social atmosphere was truly deteriorating as rapidly as claimed, a legal forum would likely not allow such posts. Therefore, the legal status of the forum weakens the conclusion by suggesting the increased posts are not necessarily indicative of a severe social problem, as a truly problematic increase would not be allowed on a legal forum.
