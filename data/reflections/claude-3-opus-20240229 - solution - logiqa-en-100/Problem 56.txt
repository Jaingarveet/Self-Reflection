Solution:
The expert asserts the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow giant ships to pass. 
Choice [REDACTED] supports this view by noting goods must be transported by road/rail due to large ships being unable to pass.
Choice [REDACTED] casts some doubt by suggesting few large ships travel above Nanjing.
Choice [REDACTED] also supports the expert by pointing out other bridges have the same low 24m clearance. 
However, Choice [REDACTED] directly contradicts the expert's key claim by stating that 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan. This proves giant ships can in fact pass under the bridge, so demolishing it is not necessary.
Therefore, Choice [REDACTED] raises the most doubt about the expert's view.
