Solution:
1. Robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls. This could mean:
   a) It recognizes color (red) but not shape, so it is type [REDACTED].
   b) It recognizes neither color nor shape, so it is type [REDACTED].
2. Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls. This could mean:  
   a) It recognizes shape (balls) but not color, so it is type [REDACTED].
   b) It recognizes neither color nor shape, so it is type [REDACTED].
3. We can't definitively say which specific type ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], or C) each robot is. But we know:
   - No.1 is not type [REDACTED], because it didn't recognize shape.
   - No.2 is not type [REDACTED], because it didn't recognize color.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: No.1 is not Type [REDACTED] and No.2 is not Type [REDACTED].
