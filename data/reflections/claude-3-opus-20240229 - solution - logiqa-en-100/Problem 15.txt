Solution:
1. The first premise states the microorganism usually breeds above freezing temperatures. The word "usually" suggests this is not an absolute rule.
2. The second premise states it is currently winter and the lake is frozen, so the temperature is below freezing.
3. The conclusion states that if the microorganism is present, it will not reproduce now due to the freezing temperatures. 
4. While the conclusion is highly likely to be true based on the premises, the use of "usually" in the first premise allows for the small possibility the conclusion could be false if this microorganism is capable of reproducing below freezing, even if it does not typically do so.
5. Therefore, the best answer is that the conclusion is highly likely to be true, but may also be false.
