Solution:
1. Li was hired by Tianshu. (given)
2. Li and Zhao were not hired by the same unit. (given)
   So Zhao was not hired by Tianshu.
3. Liu and Zhao were hired by the same unit. (given) 
   Since Zhao was not hired by Tianshu, Liu was also not hired by Tianshu.
4. If Zhang was hired by Tianxuan, then Wang was hired by Tianxuan. (given)
   This means either both Zhang and Wang are in Tianxuan, or neither of them are.
5. We know that all units hired at least one person. 
   If Zhang and Wang are not in Tianxuan, then they must both be in Tianji (because Tianshu is taken by Li). 
   In this case, Zhao and Liu must be in Tianxuan.
6. The other possibility is that both Zhang and Wang are in Tianxuan. 
   In this case, Zhao and Liu must be in Tianji.
7. In either case, only one person (either Wang or Liu) is in Tianxuan.
8. Looking at the choices, only [REDACTED] matches this deduction.
