Solution:
The passage argues that hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave, based on excavated artifacts like tools and pottery.
[REDACTED]: The cave inspiring mythological descriptions of hell does not refute people living there. 
[REDACTED]: The cave being an ancient cemetery and funeral venue would directly contradict it being a living space for hundreds. Cemeteries are for burying the dead, not housing the living.
[REDACTED]: Being the earliest prehistoric village found supports rather than refutes habitation.
[REDACTED]: The entrance collapsing 5000 years ago doesn't refute earlier Neolithic habitation, as the artifacts predate the collapse.
Therefore, [REDACTED] is the correct answer, as it provides evidence directly incompatible with the argument.
