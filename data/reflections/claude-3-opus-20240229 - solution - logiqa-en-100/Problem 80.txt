Solution:
1. The finance department is directly above the planning department (condition 2).
2. The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department (condition 3).
3. The human resources department and sales department are not on adjacent floors (condition 1).
4. Based on conditions 1-3, the bottom 3 floors must be, in order: Planning, Finance, Administration.
5. The top 3 floors must contain Human Resources, R&[REDACTED], and Sales in some order.
6. To satisfy condition 1, Human Resources and Sales cannot be adjacent, so R&[REDACTED] must be adjacent to one of them.
7. The two possible orderings for the top 3 floors are:
   - Human Resources, R&[REDACTED], Sales
   - R&[REDACTED], Human Resources, Sales
8. Combining with the known bottom 3 floors, the two possible complete orderings are:
   - Planning, Finance, Administration, Human Resources, R&[REDACTED], Sales
   - Planning, Finance, Administration, R&[REDACTED], Human Resources, Sales
9. The first ordering matches answer choice [REDACTED].
