Solution:
Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. Either E or F will participate, but not both.
2. Either J or K will participate, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G must participate.
4. M will only participate if F participates.
Now, let's consider the implications:
- If J participates, then G must participate, and K cannot participate. This accounts for 2 slots.
- If K participates, then J cannot participate. This accounts for 1 slot.
- If F participates, then E cannot participate, and M may participate. This accounts for 1 or 2 slots.
- If E participates, then F cannot participate, and thus M cannot participate. This accounts for 1 slot.
The question asks which two players, if selected, would make the four-person team the only choice. This means that these two players, along with the constraints, should uniquely determine the other two players.
The only pair that does this is [REDACTED]:
- If [REDACTED] are selected, then F must be selected (because of M), and thus E cannot be selected.
- With F selected, either J or K can be selected for the fourth slot, but if J is selected, then G must also be selected, which would exceed the team size. Therefore, K must be selected.
Thus, if [REDACTED] are selected, the only possible four-person team is F, H, K, and M.
