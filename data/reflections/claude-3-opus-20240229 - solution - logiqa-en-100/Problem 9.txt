Solution:
1. The printing group consists of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M.
2. The binding group consists of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and J.
3. K cannot replace [REDACTED] in the printing group because condition (2) states that [REDACTED] and K cannot be in the same group.
4. K can replace [REDACTED] in the binding group. This would not violate any conditions:
   - Each group would still have at least 3 employees (condition 1).
   - [REDACTED] and K would be in different groups (condition 2).
   - If K replaces [REDACTED] in the binding group, J is also in that group (condition 3).
   - M would still be in at least one group (condition 4).
   - There would still be at least one common employee ([REDACTED]) in both groups (condition 5).
5. K can replace [REDACTED] in either the printing group or the binding group, as explained in my initial response.
6. K cannot replace [REDACTED] in the printing group because then there would be no common employee in both groups, violating condition (5).
Therefore, K can replace either [REDACTED] in the binding group or [REDACTED] in either group without violating any conditions.
