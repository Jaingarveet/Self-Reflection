Solution:
Let's re-examine each choice considering all conditions:
[REDACTED]: Violates condition 2 (F and G cannot be in the same department).
[REDACTED]: Violates condition 4 (F must be in production).
[REDACTED]: Violates condition 3 (If X is in sales, W must be in production. Here X is not in sales, but W is also not in production).
[REDACTED]: Satisfies all conditions:
   - F is in production (condition 4)
   - H and Y are in the same department (sales) (condition 1)
   - F and G are in different departments (condition 2)
   - X is in public relations, so condition 3 doesn't apply
Therefore, [REDACTED] is the only choice that may list a valid final distribution.
