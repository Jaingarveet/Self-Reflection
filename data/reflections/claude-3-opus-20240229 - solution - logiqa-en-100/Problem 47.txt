Solution:
Given:
1. For listed companies, only companies with dividends can issue new stocks.
2. If a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.
3. If a company needs financing, there is no way to pay dividends.
Analyzing each statement:
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED] listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends."
   This statement cannot be false. If a listed company needs financing, it cannot pay dividends (from 3). Therefore, it must not be a company with dividends.
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED] listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends."
   This statement can be false. [REDACTED] listed company may not need financing and still be a company with dividends.
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED] listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends."
   This statement can be false. [REDACTED] listed company with dividends may choose not to issue new stocks even though it can (from 1).
[REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]"
   This statement is false. If a listed company needs financing, it cannot pay dividends (from 3), and therefore cannot issue new stocks (from 1).
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
