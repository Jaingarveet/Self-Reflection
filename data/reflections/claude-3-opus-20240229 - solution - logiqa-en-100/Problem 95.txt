Solution:
Premier Wen Jiabao's statement emphasizes the following points:
1. China has a large population of 1.3 billion.
2. [REDACTED] small problem multiplied by 1.3 billion becomes a big problem.
3. [REDACTED] large total divided by 1.3 billion becomes a small number.
4. Many foreigners do not understand this concept.
The Chinese proverb "Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high" (option D) metaphorically represents the idea that when many people contribute to a cause, the result is significant. This proverb aligns with the main point of Premier Wen Jiabao's statement, which is that China's large population can amplify small problems and diminish large totals.
