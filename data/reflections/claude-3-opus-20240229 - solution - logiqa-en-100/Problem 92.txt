Solution:
Let's reconsider the statements of each professor:
1. Professor Zhao: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team nor the Zhejiang University team."
   - If true, this eliminates Tsinghua and Zhejiang, leaving China University of Science and Technology and [REDACTED] as possibilities.
2. Professor Qian: "The champion is not the Tsinghua University team, but the University of Science and Technology of China."
   - If true, this directly states that China University of Science and Technology is the champion.
3. Professor Sun: "The champion is not the China University of Science and Technology team, but the Tsinghua University team."
   - If true, this directly states that Tsinghua University is the champion.
We know that only one professor is fully correct, one is half correct, and one is fully incorrect.
- If Professor Zhao is fully correct, then both Professor Qian and Professor Sun must be incorrect, which violates the constraint.
- If Professor Qian is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct and Professor Sun is fully incorrect. However, this is inconsistent because Professor Zhao's statement eliminates Tsinghua, contradicting Professor Qian.
- If Professor Sun is fully correct, then Professor Zhao is half correct (correct about Zhejiang not being champion) and Professor Qian is fully incorrect. This is the only scenario that satisfies the constraints.
Therefore, the champion must be the Tsinghua University team.
