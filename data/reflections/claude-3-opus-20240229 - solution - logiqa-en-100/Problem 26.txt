Solution:
The two given statements are:
1. "Money is like dung"
2. "Friends are worth a thousand dollars"
If we assume statement 2 is true, that friends are indeed worth a thousand dollars, then combining it with statement 1 leads to the absurd conclusion that "friends are like dung".
However, if statement 2 is true, then for the conclusion to be false, statement 1 must be false. In other words, if friends are truly worth a lot of money, then it cannot be true that money is like dung.
This is a conditional statement: If friends are worth a thousand dollars, then money is not like dung.
