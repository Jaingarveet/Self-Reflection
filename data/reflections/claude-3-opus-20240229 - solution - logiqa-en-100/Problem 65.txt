Solution:
1. The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict drunk driving investigations and those without.
2. Experts believe that strict drunk driving investigations can reduce traffic accidents.
3. There seems to be an inconsistency between the survey results and expert opinion.
4. Option [REDACTED] states that severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
5. This information helps explain the survey results. If strict investigations are only occurring in cities that already have a high incidence of accidents, it could explain why the accident rates are similar to cities without strict investigations.
6. Option [REDACTED] directly addresses the inconsistency by providing a plausible reason for the survey results, making it the most helpful in eliminating the inconsistency.
