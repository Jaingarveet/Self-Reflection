Solution:
Given:
1. "Alingoits Doximayo Makasey" means "kidnapping student (host) hostage"
2. "Huholikaso Makasey Mugbudengs" means "hostage holding (see) reporter" 
3. "Mugbudengs Ftoufgke Alingoits" means "kidnapping reporters away"
From sentences 2 and 3, we can deduce that "Mugbudengs" means "reporter(s)".
Now, looking at sentence 1, we see that "Doximayo" is in the same position as "student" in the translation. 
Since we know "Mugbudengs" means "reporter(s)", by process of elimination, "Doximayo" must mean "student".
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
