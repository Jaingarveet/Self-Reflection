Solution:
The passage argues that some advertisers consider ethical responsibilities in addition to economic benefits, as evidenced by their refusal to renew contracts with "Inferno" magazine after it changed its content to include violence and pornography.
To strengthen this argument, we should look for additional evidence that supports the claim about advertisers' motivations.
[REDACTED]: The cost and pricing of "Inferno" do not directly relate to advertisers' ethical considerations. (Irrelevant)
[REDACTED]: Advertisers maintaining benefits after switching publications suggests they didn't suffer economically, but it doesn't necessarily prove they were motivated by ethics. (Weak support)
[REDACTED]: Reader preferences don't directly address advertisers' motivations. (Irrelevant)
[REDACTED]: If some advertisers are switching to "Inferno" despite the content change, it suggests that not all advertisers are prioritizing ethical concerns over reaching the new target audience. This weakens the claim that advertisers are motivated by ethical responsibilities, thereby strengthening the argument by contrast. (Strongest support)
Therefore, option [REDACTED] most strengthens the argument.
