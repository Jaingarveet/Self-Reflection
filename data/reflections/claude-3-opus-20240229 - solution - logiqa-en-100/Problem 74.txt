Solution:
1. If He Zhilian is not selected, then Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the selected girls.
2. If Guo Yanran is selected, then [REDACTED] cannot be selected (condition 1).
3. So the three selected boys must be chosen from [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Ren Xiangyang, and [REDACTED].
4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected (condition 2).
5. [REDACTED] can be selected since [REDACTED] is not selected (condition 3 allows this).
6. Therefore, one valid selection for the boys is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and Ren Xiangyang.
7. [REDACTED] cannot be selected in any case if He Zhilian is not selected.
