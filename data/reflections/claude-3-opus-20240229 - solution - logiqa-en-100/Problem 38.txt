Solution:
The argument is that the increase in seals caused the decrease in crocodiles. This is considered a weak argument because seals rarely feed on crocodiles directly. 
However, answer choice [REDACTED] states that crocodiles and seals both eat capelin as their main food source. If the number of seals greatly increased, they would consume more capelin, reducing the food supply for the crocodiles. Increased competition for a limited food source could then lead to a decline in the crocodile population, even though seals don't directly prey on crocodiles.
Therefore, answer choice [REDACTED] actually strengthens the argument that seals caused the decline in crocodiles, rather than weakening it. The other answer choices do not provide as compelling a link between seal and crocodile population dynamics.
