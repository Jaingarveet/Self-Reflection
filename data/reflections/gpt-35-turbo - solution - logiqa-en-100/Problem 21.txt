Solution:
Xiao Chen believes that the flickering light emitted by Comet 1996D3 is unusual because it has never been observed before when the comet is far from the sun.
Xiao Wang refutes this by pointing out that normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun, and the flickering light was observed through continuous and careful tracking observation.
Xiao Wang's method of refutation is to point out the weakness in Xiao Chen's argument, which is lacking in persuasion.
