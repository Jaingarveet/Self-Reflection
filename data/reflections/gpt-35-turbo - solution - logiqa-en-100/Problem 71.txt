Solution:
The survey shows that a majority of respondents favor college students as nannies, but a majority of respondents would not actually hire college students as nannies. There must be a reason for this contradiction.
Option [REDACTED] provides a possible explanation for the contradiction. If respondents who favor college students as nannies believe that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, they may not be as concerned about the quality of the housekeeping services provided by college students. On the other hand, respondents who would not actually hire college students as nannies may be more concerned about the quality of the housekeeping services provided and may not believe that college students are capable of providing high-quality services.
