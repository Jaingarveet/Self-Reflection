Solution:
The statement implies that there is a trade-off between cost and profit. If the cost is high, the profit is low, and if the profit is high, the cost is low. This means that the interests of the boss and the employees are not necessarily aligned. If the cost is high, the employees' wages are high, but the boss's profit is low. If the profit is high, the employees' wages may be low, but the boss's profit is high. Therefore, the conclusion that is most strongly supported is that if the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest.
