Solution:
The problem requires selecting four players from a group of seven players. 
E or F has one person to participate, but not both. 
One of J or K will participate, but not both. 
If J participates, then G participates. 
Unless F participates, M does not participate. 
If E is selected, then F cannot be selected. If F is selected, then E cannot be selected. So, either E or F will be selected, but not both. 
If J is selected, then G must be selected. If K is selected, then G cannot be selected. So, either J or K will be selected, but not both. 
If M is not selected, then F cannot be selected. So, if M is not selected, then E will be selected. 
Therefore, the possible combinations are:
- E, G, J, and F
- E, G, J, and K
- F, G, J, and M
- F, G, K, and M
The only combination that satisfies all the conditions is F, G, J, and M.
