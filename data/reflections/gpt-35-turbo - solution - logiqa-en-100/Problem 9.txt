Solution:
Printing group: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], M
Binding group: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], J
K cannot be in the same group as [REDACTED].
If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
At least one of the same employees in both groups.
If K replaces [REDACTED] in the printing group, then the printing group will be composed of [REDACTED], K, [REDACTED], and M. [REDACTED]owever, this violates the condition that if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Therefore, K cannot replace [REDACTED] in the printing group. 
If K replaces [REDACTED] in the binding group, then the binding group will be composed of [REDACTED], J, and K. This satisfies all the given conditions. The printing group will be composed of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M, which also satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, K can replace [REDACTED] without violating any of the given conditions.
