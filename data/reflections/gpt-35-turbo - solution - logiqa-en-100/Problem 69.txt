Solution:
Zhang Shan's bonus > Li Si's bonus
Zhang Shan's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus
Wang Wu's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus
If Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's bonus, then Zhang Shan's bonus would be higher than Li Si's bonus as well.
If Li Si's bonus is equal to or higher than Wang Wu's bonus, then Zhang Shan's bonus would be equal to or higher than Wang Wu's bonus.
