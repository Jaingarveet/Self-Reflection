Solution:
If G is the northernmost island, it could be either at the top of the line or second from the top. 
Case 1: G is at the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From ([REDACTED]), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From ([REDACTED]), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is G-F-H-E-I.
Case [REDACTED]: G is second from the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From ([REDACTED]), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From ([REDACTED]), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the possible arrangement is F-G-H-E-I.
