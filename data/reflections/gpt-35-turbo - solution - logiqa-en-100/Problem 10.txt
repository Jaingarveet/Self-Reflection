Solution:
The researchers believe that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power.
The question asks for the choice that best supports the researchers' views.
Choice [REDACTED] supports the researchers' views by providing additional information that the mathematics scores of the two groups of students were almost the same before the experiment. This information supports the idea that the improvement in the test group's mathematics ability was due to the micro-shocks in the brain and not due to any pre-existing differences between the two groups.
