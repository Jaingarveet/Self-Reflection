Solution:
If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then F and M are in charge of different departments.
From the given conditions, we know that H and I are not in charge of the same department.
Therefore, F and I cannot be in the same department.
Also, if F and M are in different departments, then P cannot be in the same department as either F or M.
Therefore, I and P must be in the same department.
