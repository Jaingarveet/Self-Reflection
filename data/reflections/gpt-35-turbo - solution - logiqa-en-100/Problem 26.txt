Solution:
If "friends are like dung" is not true, then it must be false that "friends are worth a thousand dollars". This is because the two statements are logically equivalent. If one is false, then the other must also be false. Therefore, the statement "friends are valuable" is not necessarily true. However, if a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung. This statement provides a logical explanation for why the conclusion "friends are like dung" is not true.
