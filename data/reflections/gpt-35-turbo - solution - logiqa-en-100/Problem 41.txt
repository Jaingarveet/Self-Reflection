Solution:
If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt.
The contrapositive of the conditional statement is: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, then it cannot increase productivity by 10%.
Therefore, if Green Island does not increase productivity by 10%, it does not necessarily mean it will go bankrupt.
