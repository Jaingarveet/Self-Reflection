Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible days that Himalayans could be featured.
I correctly identified that Himalayans could not be featured on day 1, but I incorrectly assumed that they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
The correct days that Himalayans could be featured are days 2, 4, and 5.
I also failed to consider the restriction that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Failure to consider all restrictions
Solution:
If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 5.
Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
Using these restrictions, we can eliminate the pairs of days that cannot feature the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.
For example, we know that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so we can eliminate answer choice A.
We also know that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, so we can eliminate answer choices C and E.
The correct answer is B because it is the only pair of days that violates the restriction that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all of the restrictions.
2. Identify the days that each breed can be featured based on the given restrictions.
3. Use the restrictions to eliminate the pairs of days that cannot feature the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.
4. Double-check your reasoning to ensure that you have considered all of the restrictions.
5. Choose the answer that violates one or more of the restrictions.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and make sure you understand all of the restrictions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that you have considered all of the restrictions.
 - Always eliminate answer choices that violate one or more of the restrictions.
 - Remember to consider all of the restrictions, even if they seem redundant or unnecessary.
