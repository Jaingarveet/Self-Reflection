Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the possible orderings of the articles. 
I did not consider all possible orderings and did not fully apply the given conditions. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Insufficient application of conditions
 - Logical error
Solution:
If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and H must be fourth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and H must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
If S is third, then Q must be first or second, which means G must be first or second, respectively. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
Therefore, if Y is fourth, S must be second, Q must be third, G must be first, H must be fifth, R must be sixth, and J must be seventh. This means that J is second, not third.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given conditions and constraints.
3. Consider all possible orderings of the articles.
4. Apply the given conditions and constraints to eliminate impossible orderings.
5. Deduce the possible orderings that satisfy all the conditions and constraints.
6. Check each possible ordering to determine which statements must be true.
7. Choose the answer that matches your deduction.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the given conditions and constraints.
 - Always consider all possible cases and orderings.
 - Always apply the given conditions and constraints to eliminate impossible cases.
 - Always deduce the possible cases that satisfy all the conditions and constraints.
 - Always check each possible case to determine which statements must be true.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving problems in law.
