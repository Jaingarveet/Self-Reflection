Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I did not consider the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. 
Error Keywords:
 - Ignored constraint
 - Misunderstood constraint
 - Overlooked constraint
Solution:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, Kayne and Novetzke must be assigned to Zambia and Yemen, respectively. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively. Finally, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Landon and Novetzke.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the constraints and write them down.
3. Use the constraints to eliminate impossible scenarios.
4. Use the constraints to identify possible scenarios.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always write down the constraints to help you visualize the problem.
 - Always use the constraints to eliminate impossible scenarios.
 - Always use the constraints to identify possible scenarios.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that constraints are essential in solving problems.
