Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option C, Solide's voicemail target, as the target that must also be 2 days. However, the correct answer is option A, Image's voicemail target. This is because the question states that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. If Image's website target is 2 days, then its voicemail target must be shorter than 2 days. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must also be 2 days to satisfy the conditions.
