Explanation:
My mistake was in misinterpreting the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. I assumed that Solide's website target was 1 day because Truvest's website target was 1 day. However, the correct interpretation is that Solide's website target is longer than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. This means that Image's website target must be 2 days.

Solution:
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days. 
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 2 days. 
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day. 
Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days.
