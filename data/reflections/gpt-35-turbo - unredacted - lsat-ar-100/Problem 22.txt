Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all the conditions while selecting the answer. 
If both G and H are selected, then we can't select F, K, and M together. 
If we select F, then we can't select more than one zoologist. 
If we select K, then we can't select M. 
If we select M, then we must select both P and R. 
If we select H, then we can't select F and M together. 
Therefore, the panel must include either F or K. 
Error Keywords:
 - Missed conditions
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Logical error
Solution:
If both G and H are selected, then we can't select F, K, and M together. 
If we select F, then we can't select more than one zoologist. 
If we select K, then we can't select M. 
If we select M, then we must select both P and R. 
If we select H, then we can't select F and M together. 
Therefore, the panel must include either F or K.
