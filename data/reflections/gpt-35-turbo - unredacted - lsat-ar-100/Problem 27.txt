Explanation:
I misread the question and did not consider all the given conditions. 
I only focused on the fact that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and that only two students can review the same play. 
I did not consider the other conditions, such as Megregian reviewing more plays than Kramer and Lopez and that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Ignoring conditions
 - Overgeneralization
Solution:
Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Therefore, only two students can review Tamerlane.
However, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
Therefore, the only possible combination is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand all the given conditions.
2. Identify the students who review Tamerlane.
3. Identify the students who review the same play or plays as each other.
4. Identify the students who review the same play or plays as those who review Tamerlane.
5. Identify the students who do not review any play reviewed by Jiang.
6. Identify the student who reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez.
7. Combine the identified students to form a list of students who review Tamerlane.
8. Double-check that the list satisfies all the given conditions.
9. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand all the given conditions.
 - Never ignore any given conditions or overgeneralize from partial information.
 - Always double-check that your solution satisfies all the given conditions.
 - Remember that some conditions may be interdependent, and you need to consider all of them together.
