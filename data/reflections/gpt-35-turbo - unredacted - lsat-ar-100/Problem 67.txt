Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday, but it could also be made on Wednesday or Thursday. 
I also did not consider the possibility that the first batch of peanut butter cookies could be made on Friday. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Limited scope
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Wednesday or Thursday. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday or Friday. If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. If the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
