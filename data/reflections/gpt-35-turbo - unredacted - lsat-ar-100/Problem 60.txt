Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the possible days that Himalayans and Rottweilers could be featured. 
I also did not consider all of the rules when evaluating the answer choices. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of rules
 - Error in analysis
 - Failure to consider all rules
Solution:
We know that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or days 3, 4, and 5.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 4, and 6 or days 1, 3, and 5.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Therefore, Greyhounds cannot be featured on days 2 or 3.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, we can eliminate some of the answer choices based on this rule.
Answer Choice A: Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese
- Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 3 and 4). Eliminate.
Answer Choice B: Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx Himalayan, Manx
- Himalayans are featured on consecutive days (days 2 and 3). Eliminate.
Answer Choice C: Manx, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Manx, Siamese
- Rottweilers are featured on consecutive days (days 2 and 4). Eliminate.
Answer Choice D: Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Himalayan, Siamese, Siamese, Himalayan
- Rottweilers are featured on consecutive days (days 1 and 3). Eliminate.
Answer Choice E: Siamese, Himalayan, Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Himalayan
- This order satisfies all of the rules.
