Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning when I assumed that the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. 
The gap in my knowledge was in not considering all possible scenarios. 
I also made an error in assuming that the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Scenario error
 - Logic error
Solution:
If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. 
From the second condition, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday. 
If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, which satisfies the first condition. 
If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, which satisfies the first condition. 
Therefore, options A, B, and C are all possible. 
Instructions:
