Explanation:
I misread the question and did not pay attention to the fact that the question asked for a list of sales representatives working in Zone 3, not the total number of sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
I also did not consider the fact that the question asked for a complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3, not just any possible combination of sales representatives. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Inattention to detail
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrect interpretation
Solution:
Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey are not mentioned in any of the conditions that specify which sales representatives work in which sales zones. Therefore, they could work in any of the three sales zones. 
If Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3. 
If Udall works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 3. 
Therefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim and Mahr.
