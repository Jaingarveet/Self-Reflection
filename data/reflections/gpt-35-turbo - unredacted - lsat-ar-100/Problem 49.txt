Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not follow all the constraints given in the problem. I missed the constraint that one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row from the pharmacy. 
Error Keywords:
 - Missed constraint
 - Misunderstood problem
 - Logical error
Solution:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
The only option that satisfies all the constraints is E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
2. Identify the constraints and write them down.
3. Use the constraints to eliminate any options that do not satisfy them.
4. Double-check that all the constraints are satisfied by the chosen option.
5. Choose the option that satisfies all the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
 - Write down the constraints to help you visualize the problem.
 - Use the constraints to eliminate any options that do not satisfy them.
 - Double-check that all the constraints are satisfied by the chosen option.
 - If you miss a constraint, start over and read the problem again.
