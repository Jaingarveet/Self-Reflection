Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning when setting up the equation. I tried to calculate the new number of miles Alan should drive each week to reduce his expenditure by $5, but I set up the equation incorrectly. Instead of equating the cost of the reduced miles to the desired reduction of $5, I equated it to the new total expenditure of $11.
