Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I thought that because there were two unknowns (x and y) and only one equation, it would be impossible to determine the value of the expression. However, I failed to recognize that the expression $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ can be simplified to $2^{3x-y}$, which is exactly the left-hand side of the given equation multiplied by 2. Therefore, the value of the expression can be determined.
