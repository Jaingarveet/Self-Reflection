Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required for all amino acids. 
However, hydroxylysine is an exception. 
It is synthesized directly from lysine after protein synthesis.
Error Keywords:
 - Overgeneralization
 - Incomplete knowledge
 - Exception not considered
Solution:
Aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required for protein synthesis.
[REDACTED] is an exception.
[REDACTED] is synthesized directly from lysine after protein synthesis.
Therefore, aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is not required for hydroxylysine.
