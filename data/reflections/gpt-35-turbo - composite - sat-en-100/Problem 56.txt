Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of the phrase "hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands." I assumed that Sempere did not want the narrator to pay for the books, but the correct interpretation is that Sempere did not expect the narrator to pay the full price for the books.
