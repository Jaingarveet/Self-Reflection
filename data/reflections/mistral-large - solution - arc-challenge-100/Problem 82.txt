Solution:
The mass of an atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, as electrons have negligible mass.
In this case, the atom has [REDACTED] protons and [REDACTED] neutrons.
The mass of the atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.
The sum of [REDACTED] protons and [REDACTED] neutrons is [REDACTED].
