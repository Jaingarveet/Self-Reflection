Solution:
The formation of new stars occurs when a cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. As the cloud collapses, it begins to spin and form a disk of material around a central protostar. The protostar continues to gather material from the disk, eventually becoming hot and dense enough to initiate nuclear fusion, at which point it becomes a main sequence star.

The process described in choice [REDACTED] is associated with the death of stars, not their formation. Choice [REDACTED] describes the formation of second-generation stars, which occurs after the first generation of stars has died and released material into space. Choice [REDACTED] describes a process that occurs in the later stages of a star's life, not during its formation. Choice [REDACTED] is not necessarily associated with the formation of new stars.
