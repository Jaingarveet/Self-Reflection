Solution:
Animal instinct refers to the innate behaviors that animals exhibit without being taught. Migrating, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are all examples of animal instinct. However, [REDACTED] can be learned behaviors, not just instinctual ones. For example, a mother lion may teach her cubs how to hunt. Therefore, [REDACTED] are not always an example of animal instinct.
