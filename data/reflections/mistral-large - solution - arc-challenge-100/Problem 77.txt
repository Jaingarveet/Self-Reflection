Solution:
The introduction of a new predator to the island will likely affect the sheep population based on their physical traits, such as size and color.
Since the dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, they are more likely to survive and reproduce, making them less vulnerable to predation.
On the other hand, the light wool sheep are smaller and weaker, making them more vulnerable to predation.
Therefore, the population of sheep with light wool is more likely to decrease first.
