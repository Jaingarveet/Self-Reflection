Advice:
- Always read the question and the premises carefully.
- Understand the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
- Consider the possibility of other factors not mentioned in the premises that could affect the conclusion.
- Don't assume that the premises provide absolute certainty for the conclusion.
- Be aware that in logic, a conclusion can be highly likely based on the premises, but it may also be false due to other factors.
