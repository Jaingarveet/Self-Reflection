Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking.
- Pay attention to the wording of the question. The word "except" indicates that you are looking for the statement that does not fit with the others.
- Use logical reasoning to evaluate each statement and determine whether it supports or challenges the opinion.
- Be aware of your own biases and do not let them influence your interpretation of the statements.
