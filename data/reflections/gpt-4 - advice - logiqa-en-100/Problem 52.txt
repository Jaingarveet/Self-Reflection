Advice:
- Always read the statement carefully and understand the relationship between the variables.
- Try to infer the implicit implications of the statement.
- Evaluate each conclusion based on the information and implications of the statement, not on external assumptions.
- Choose the conclusion that is most strongly supported by the statement, even if it is not explicitly stated.
