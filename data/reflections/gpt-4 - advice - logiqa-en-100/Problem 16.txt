Advice:
- Always read the question and context carefully.
- Try to identify the implicit assumptions in the argument.
- Don't focus solely on explicit information; consider the underlying implications.
- Compare these assumptions with the answer choices before making a decision.
- Practice more logic-based questions to improve your ability to identify implicit assumptions.
