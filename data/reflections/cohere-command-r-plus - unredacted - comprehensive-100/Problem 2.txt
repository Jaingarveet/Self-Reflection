Explanation: 
I correctly calculated the total length of the fence in inches, but I made a mistake in converting it to feet. I divided by 12 instead of multiplying by 1/12, which is the correct conversion factor for inches to feet. This is a simple unit conversion error.

- Unit conversion error
- Arithmetic error
- Simplification error

Solution: 
Each picket plus the space is 6.5 inches. 
The total length of the fence is (6+1/2)x inches = 13/2*x inches.
To convert this to feet, we multiply by 1/12, not divide.
So, the length of the fence in feet is (13x/2)*1/12 feet, which simplifies to (13x-12)/24 feet.

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total length of the fence in inches.
2. Identify the conversion factor for inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).
3. Multiply the length in inches by the conversion factor to get the length in feet.
4. Simplify the final expression.
5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result.

Advice:
- Always double-check your unit conversions. 
- Be aware of common unit conversion factors and use them correctly. 
- Simplify expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. 
- Read the answer choices carefully, and ensure your simplified expression matches exactly.
