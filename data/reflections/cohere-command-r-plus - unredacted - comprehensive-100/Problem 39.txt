Explanation:
I overlooked the keyword "some" in the question and the option choices. 
The correct answer is E because it is the only option that refers to "some stories," indicating a partial truth, rather than making a generalization about all horror stories.
Error Keywords:
- Oversight
- Keyword neglect
- False generalization
Solution:
The provided statements describe two types of horror stories: those featuring mad scientists and those featuring monstrous beasts. Both types share two common features: they violate the laws of nature and evoke dread in readers.

Option E states: "Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature."
This option is the correct answer because it is the only one that captures the partial truth reflected in the statements. While not all horror stories employ symbolism, the statements indicate that some stories within these two subtypes do violate the laws of nature.

The other options make broader generalizations that are not supported by the provided information. They either refer to "all" stories or make assertions about the intentions or content of all stories within a specific type, which goes beyond the scope of the given statements.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the keywords, such as "some" or "all."
2. Analyze the provided statements to identify the common features of the two types of horror stories.
3. Evaluate each option:
    - Option A: Incorrect because it refers to "all" descriptions and makes a broader assertion than what is stated.
    - Option B: Incorrect because it generalizes beyond the scope of the provided information.
    - Option C: Incorrect because it makes a broad assertion about all horror stories, which is not supported.
    - Option D: Incorrect because it focuses on authors' views, which is not the main point of the statements.
    - Option E: Correct because it refers to "some stories" and captures the partial truth about violations of the laws of nature.
4. Select option E as the correct answer.
