Explanation: I misinterpreted the information in the passage and overlooked the critical clue that the absence of crops was intended to avoid competition with weeds, which would have influenced the weed coverage. This led me to conclude that the weed coverage percentages would be indeterminate when, in fact, the presence of crops would likely have reduced weed coverage.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Oversight
- Incomplete reasoning

Solution: The passage states that Seydel did not plant crops to avoid competition with weeds. This suggests that the presence of crops would have provided additional competition and potentially reduced the weed coverage. Therefore, if Seydel had planted wheat or corn, the percentage of weed coverage would likely have been lower than what Hartmann observed without any crops.

Instructions:
1. Identify the key information in the passage: Seydel's decision not to plant crops and the reason for it.
2. Consider the impact of crop competition on weed coverage.
3. Reason through the potential outcome if crops had been planted.
4. Choose the answer option that aligns with the expected outcome.

Advice:
- Read the passage thoroughly and identify any critical information that could influence the outcome.
- Consider all relevant factors and their potential impact on the situation.
- Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions based on incomplete information.
- Always consider alternative explanations or outcomes.
- Choose the answer option that best aligns with the information presented and any reasonable inferences that can be made.
