Explanation: I misinterpreted the information given in the question and made an error in calculating the length of line segment RU. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
- Length calculation error

Solution: 

Given:
- RS = 5
- RT = 17
- ST = 22

We want to find RU. 

Since U is the midpoint of ST, then:
- UT = 22 / 2 = 11

Now, we can find RU:
- RU = RT - UT = 17 - 11 = 6

So, the length of line segment RU is 6.

Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST.
2. Identify the relationship between the segments: U is the midpoint of ST.
3. Calculate the length of UT since U is the midpoint: UT = ST / 2.
4. Find the length of RU using the given information: RU = RT - UT.
5. Double-check your calculations and the relationship between the segments.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
- Read the question carefully and identify the given information.
- Draw a diagram if it helps visualize the problem.
- Clearly define the variables and relationships in the problem.
- Double-check your calculations and the logic behind them.
- Ensure you understand the geometric properties and definitions involved.
