Explanation: I incorrectly calculated the number of family members and then the share for each nephew. This led me to choose answer option A, which is incorrect. The correct answer is indeed option E. 

Error Keywords:
- Arithmetic error
- Division error
- Calculation error

Solution: 
The total amount to be distributed is Rs. 8600, and there are 11 family members in total: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of family members: 
Total family members = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

Step 2: Find the share for each nephew: 
Nephew's share = Total amount / Total family members = Rs. 8600 / 11 = Rs. 781.82 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Step 3: Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share: 
Daughter's share = 4 * Nephew's share = 4 * Rs. 781.82 = Rs. 3127.28. 

Step 4: Check the answer options: 
Option E offers the closest rounded value to our calculated result, so the final answer is E. 

Instructions: 
- Calculate the total number of family members. 
- Find the share for each nephew by dividing the total amount by the total number of family members. 
- Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share. 
- Check the answer options for the closest match to your calculated result. 

Advice: 
- Always double-check your calculations, especially when dividing amounts. 
- Pay attention to the relationships between the amounts received by different family members. 
- Ensure you understand the question's context and relationships before beginning calculations. 
- Rounding values can help simplify calculations, but be mindful of significant figures and potential rounding errors.
