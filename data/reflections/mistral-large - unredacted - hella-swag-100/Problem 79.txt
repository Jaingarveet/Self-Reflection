Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the context of the text carefully enough. I assumed that the closing image would be a visual representation of the dog being clean, rather than additional information about the wash.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumptions
 - Context
 - Reading comprehension

Solution:
The text describes the process of bathing a dog, which typically takes place in a tub or shower. The closing image is likely to provide additional information about the wash, such as the type of soap used or the frequency of bathing.

2. Identify the main topic of the text.
3. Consider what additional information might be relevant to the topic.
4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the context and topic of the text.
