Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the context of the competition and the fact that it was a snatch competition, not just a weightlifting competition.
The gap in my knowledge was not in common sense but in understanding the specific context of the competition.
I knew that shaking hands and saluting is a common way for competitors to show respect and sportsmanship towards each other after they have finished their lift, but I did not consider that this may not be the most likely completion of the text in the context of a snatch competition.

Error Keywords:
 - Lack of context
 - Misinterpretation of the competition
 - Incorrect assumption

Solution:
The text describes a snatch competition where large men lift a heavy barbell over their heads and receive a score.
The most likely completion of the text would be a description of what happens after the competition has ended and the victor has been declared.
The top three men posing with their medals is a common way to celebrate the winners of a competition, and this is a likely completion of the text as it describes what happens after the competition has ended.
