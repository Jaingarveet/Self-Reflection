I incorrectly answered the question because I did not carefully read and understand the text provided. I assumed that the text was describing a specific scenario and chose the answer that seemed most related to that scenario, even though it was too long and convoluted. However, the correct answer was actually a more general description of the scene, which was a title screen showing the man pulling from the ground up on the same machine.
