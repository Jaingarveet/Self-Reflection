Explanation:
I did not pay close attention to the details in the text and did not use common sense to eliminate unlikely options. 
I chose "None of the Above" because none of the options matched the description in the text. However, the correct answer was B, which was a plausible completion of the text. 
Error Keywords:
 - Lack of attention to detail
 - Failure to eliminate unlikely options
 - Overthinking the problem
Solution:
The text describes a man in blue kneeling and pulling a handle on an exercise machine while another man gives directions. The kneeling man finishes and stands up. 
Option B is the most likely completion of the text because it describes the man pulling the handle from the ground up on the same machine. 
Instructions:
1. Read the text carefully and pay attention to the details.
2. Eliminate unlikely options based on common sense.
3. Choose the most plausible completion of the text.
4. Double-check your answer to ensure it matches the description in the text.
Advice:
 - Always read the question or text carefully and pay attention to the details.
 - Use common sense to eliminate unlikely options.
 - Do not overthink the problem or add unnecessary details.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure it matches the description in the text.
