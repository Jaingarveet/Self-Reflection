Explanation:
I misread the passage and did not pay close attention to the details of how the Chukars climbed the ramps. 
The passage explains that the Chukars angled their wings differently from birds in flight and aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp.
