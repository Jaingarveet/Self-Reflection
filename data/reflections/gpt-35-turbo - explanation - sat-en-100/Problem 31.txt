Explanation:
I incorrectly inferred that Usherwood used ibises because they were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration. However, the passage clearly states that the ibises were hand-raised and that data loggers were specially built for the study. The correct answer is [REDACTED] because the passage states that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
