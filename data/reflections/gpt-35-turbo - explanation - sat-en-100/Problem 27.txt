Explanation:
I misread the question and chose the wrong answer. 
The authors proposed that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine in DN[REDACTED]. 
The question asked if the data in the table supported the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DN[REDACTED]. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine.
