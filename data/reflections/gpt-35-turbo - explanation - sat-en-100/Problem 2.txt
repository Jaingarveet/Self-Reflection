Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Passage 1 was arguing that running a household and raising children were rewarding for women. However, the passage only argues that women are better suited for these roles due to their "delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood." Passage 1 does not make any claims about the rewards of these roles for men or women.
