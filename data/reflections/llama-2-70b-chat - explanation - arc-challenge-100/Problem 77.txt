Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between the sheep's traits and their ability to survive and breed. I thought that the larger and stronger sheep with dark wool would have an advantage in the presence of a new predator, but in reality, the opposite is true. The sheep with light wool, which are smaller and weaker, will be better able to escape the predator and survive, leading to an increase in their population.
