Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the definition of a mixture. I thought that a mixture was defined as a combination of substances that are not chemically combined, but I forgot that the components of a mixture must also retain their original properties. In this case, the snack is a mixture because the peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces are all distinct and retain their original properties, making it a heterogeneous mixture.
