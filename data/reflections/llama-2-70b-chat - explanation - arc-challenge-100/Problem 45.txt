Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the weight of the astronaut on the Moon.
I correctly calculated the weight of the astronaut on the Moon as 31/6 = 5 pounds, but then I incorrectly converted it to kilograms.
I mistakenly thought that 5 pounds was equal to 14 kilograms, when in fact it is equal to approximately 2.3 kilograms.
