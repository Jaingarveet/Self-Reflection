Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the term "reversible" in the context of the question. I thought it referred to the possibility of restoring the wood to its original state, which is not possible. However, the correct interpretation of "reversible" in this context is that the energy in the wood can be transformed into other forms, such as heat and light, but it is not destroyed.
