Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the term "sample" and thought it referred to the number of atoms in a substance, which remains constant regardless of its size or state. However, the question was asking about the physical properties of a small, solid sample of aluminum and a large, liquid sample of aluminum.
