Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between density and mass. I thought that the higher density of red-clay bricks meant that a given volume of bricks would have a higher mass than the same volume of air. However, the density of an object is actually a measure of its mass per unit volume, so the mass of an object is directly proportional to its density and volume. Therefore, the mass of a given volume of bricks will be higher than the mass of the same volume of air.
