Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. I thought that [REDACTED] was the process that led to the construction of new land, but it is actually [REDACTED] that plays this role. Deposition is the process of sediment settling in a new location, which can lead to the formation of new land.
