Solution:
To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 0.5 and the second equation by 1.5 to make the coefficients of y the same:
1.2x - 0.75y = 0.15
2.4x + 0.75y = -1.95
Adding these two equations together, we get:
3.6x = -1.8
Solving for x, we find:
x = -1.8 / 3.6 = [REDACTED]
