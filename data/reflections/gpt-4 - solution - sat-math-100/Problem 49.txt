Solution:
The equation is a rational equation, and it can be solved by equating the numerators of both sides since the denominators are already equal. 
So, we have: 
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - [REDACTED] - 5[REDACTED]
24x^2 + 25x - 47 = -8x - 56
After correctly combining the terms, we get:
24x^2 + [REDACTED][REDACTED]x + 9 = 0
This is not the correct equation. The correct equation after combining the terms should be:
24x^2 + [REDACTED][REDACTED]x + 9 = 0
Solving this equation gives us the correct value of 'a' which is [REDACTED].
