Solution:
The given equation is a quadratic equation. The solutions to a quadratic equation $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$ are given by the formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.
Here, a=3, b=12, and c=6.
So, the solutions are $x=\frac{-12\pm\sqrt{12^{2}-4*3*6}}{2*3}$.
This simplifies to $x=-2\pm\frac{\sqrt{36}}{6}$, which further simplifies to $x=-2\pm\sqrt{2}$.
