Solution:
The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a + 2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$.
Since the equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients on the left side must equal the coefficients on the right side.
Therefore, $ab = 15$ and $7a + 2b = c$.
We also know that $a + b = 8$.
We can solve for a and b using the equations $ab = 15$ and $a + b = 8$.
The solutions are $(a, b) = (5, 3)$ or $(a, b) = (3, 5)$.
Substituting these values into the equation $7a + 2b = c$ gives $c = 41$ or $c = 31$.
