Solution:
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, we can take the points (a, 0) and (3a, -a). The slope m = (-a - 0) / (3a - a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.
The y-intercept is the y-value when x = a, which is 0.
So, the equation of the line is y = -1/2x + 0. 
We can rearrange this to the form of the answer choices: 2x + y = 0.
However, we need to express the equation in terms of 'a', so we multiply the entire equation by 'a' to get: 2ax + ay = 0, which simplifies to x + 2y = 0, or in terms of 'a', x + 2y = a.
