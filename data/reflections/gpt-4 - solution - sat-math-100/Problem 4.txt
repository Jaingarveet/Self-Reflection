Solution:
The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If the line passes through the origin, then the y-intercept must be zero. This means that when x=[REDACTED], y must also be [REDACTED]. 
We can set up the equation of the line using the slope and one of the points, (2, k), and then set y=[REDACTED] and solve for x:
[REDACTED] = [(32-k)/(k-2)]*([REDACTED]-2) + k
[REDACTED] = -2*(32-k)/(k-2) + k
[REDACTED] = -6[REDACTED] + 2k + k(k-2)
[REDACTED] = k^2 - 66k + 6[REDACTED]
Solving this quadratic equation for k, we find that k = 2 or k = 32. However, k cannot be 2 because the denominator of the slope would be zero, which is undefined. Therefore, the only possible value for k is 32.
