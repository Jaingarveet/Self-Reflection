Solution:
Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5. Since gasoline costs $4 per gallon, this means he wants to use 5/4 = 1.25 gallons less each week. 
Since his car can travel an average of 25 miles per gallon, the equation to find the number of fewer miles he should drive each week is 4/25 * m = 5, where m is the number of miles less he should drive each week.
