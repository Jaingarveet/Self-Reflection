Solution:
The principal site of acidification of urine is the collecting duct in the kidney.
The collecting duct is the part of the nephron where the urine is concentrated and prepared for excretion.
The acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct through the action of hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).
