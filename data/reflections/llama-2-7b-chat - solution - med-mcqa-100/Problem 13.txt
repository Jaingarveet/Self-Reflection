Solution:
Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and small intestine, becomes narrowed or blocked. The investigation of choice for pyloric stenosis depends on the age of the patient and the severity of the symptoms.

1. Identify the age range of the patient.
2. Assess the severity of the symptoms.
3. Choose the appropriate investigation: [REDA[REDACTED]ED] for children under 1 year of age, [REDA[REDACTED]ED] for older children and adults, and [REDACTED] for rare cases where other investigations are inconclusive.
