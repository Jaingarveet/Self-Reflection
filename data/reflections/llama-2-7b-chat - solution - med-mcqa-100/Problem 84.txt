Solution:
The trabecular meshwork is a structure in the eye that regulates aqueous outflow. [REDACTED] increases aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by increasing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, allowing aqueous humor to flow more easily. [REDACTED], brimonidine, and brinzolamide decrease aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork by reducing the number of channels between the trabecular cells, thereby decreasing the flow of aqueous humor.
