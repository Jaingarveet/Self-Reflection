Solution:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:

1. Identify the given information: concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) = 1 x 10-6 moles/litre
2. Calculate the pH of the solution using the pH formula: pH = -log[H+]
3. Consider the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and calculate the pH of the solution using the updated formula: pH = -log[H+] - log[OH-]
