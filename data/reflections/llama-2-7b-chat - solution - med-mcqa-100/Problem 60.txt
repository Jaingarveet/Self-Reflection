Solution:
For an epidemiological study, every 10th person is selected from a population. This type of sampling is known as systemic random sampling.

In systemic random sampling, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of their location or any other characteristic. This method is suitable for studying the prevalence of a disease or condition in a population.
