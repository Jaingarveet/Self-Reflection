Advice:
 - Always consider safety first when designing experiments. 
 - Ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of the experimental procedure and requirements. 
 - Avoid making assumptions about the necessity of safety equipment. 
 - Remember that a stopwatch is used for timing, which is not required to determine a fixed temperature like the boiling point.
