Advice:
 - Focus on the key concepts: inherited traits, genetics, and consistency across generations. 
 - Distinguish between environmental influences and genetic determinants when evaluating traits. 
 - Recognize that inherited traits are those that remain relatively consistent across generations, indicating their genetic basis. 
 - Avoid the pitfall of attributing environmental variations to genetic inheritance. 
 - Always consider the underlying genetic mechanisms when evaluating potential inherited traits.
