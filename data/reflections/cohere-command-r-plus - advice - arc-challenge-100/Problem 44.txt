Advice:
 - Understand the fundamental forces acting on an object: gravity, normal force, friction, etc.
 - Recognize how forces influence an object's motion: acceleration, deceleration, or constant speed.
 - Decompose complex forces into their components when necessary, especially with inclined planes.
 - Always consider all forces and their interactions, not just a single force in isolation.
 - Remember that speed changes occur when forces are imbalanced, and constant speed occurs when forces are balanced.
