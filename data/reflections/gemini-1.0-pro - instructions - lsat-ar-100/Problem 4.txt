Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints on the assignment of lab assistants to sessions.
2. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
3. Analyze each scenario to determine the possible lab assistants for the Thursday session.
4. If a single lab assistant is possible in all scenarios, then that lab assistant must lead the Thursday session.
5. If multiple lab assistants are possible, then we cannot determine which lab assistant must lead the Thursday session.
