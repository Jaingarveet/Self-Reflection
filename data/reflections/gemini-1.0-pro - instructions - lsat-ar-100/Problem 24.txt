Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the original constraint.
2. Identify the variables involved in the constraint (e.g., which candidates are being considered, what conditions are being set).
3. Analyze each option and determine how it would affect the assignment of the variables compared to the original constraint.
4. Look for options that are logically equivalent to the original constraint, such as the converse, inverse, or contrapositive.
5. Choose the option that has the same effect on the assignment as the original constraint.
