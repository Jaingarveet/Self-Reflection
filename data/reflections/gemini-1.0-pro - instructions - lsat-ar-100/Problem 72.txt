Instructions:
1. Read and understand all constraints.
2. Start with the most constrained element (pharmacy) and place it first.
3. Place elements with the most restrictions next.
4. Consider the separation requirements between elements.
5. Work step-by-step, placing elements and checking constraints.
6. Double-check placement against all constraints before finalizing.
