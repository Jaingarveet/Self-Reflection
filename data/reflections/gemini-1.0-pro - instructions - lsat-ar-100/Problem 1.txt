Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand all conditions and constraints.
2. Analyze each option systematically, considering all conditions and constraints.
3. If a condition or constraint is violated in an option, eliminate that option.
4. If an option satisfies all conditions and constraints, consider it a possible solution.
5. If multiple options satisfy all conditions and constraints, identify the one that best fits the overall context or additional information.
6. Double-check your analysis and reasoning to ensure accuracy.
