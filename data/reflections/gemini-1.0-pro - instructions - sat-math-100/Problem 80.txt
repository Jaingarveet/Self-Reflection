Instructions:
1. Multiply both equations by appropriate constants to make the coefficients of one variable equal but opposite.
2. Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into one of the original equations.
5. Solve for the other variable.
6. Substitute the values of both variables into the other original equation.
7. Solve for the constant $k$.
8. Double-check all calculations and steps to ensure accuracy.
9. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
