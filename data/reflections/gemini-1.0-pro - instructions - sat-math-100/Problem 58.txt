Instructions:
1. Identify the solution point $(x,y)$.
2. Substitute the solution point into each inequality.
3. Simplify each inequality to determine the conditions on $a$ and $b$.
4. Compare the conditions on $a$ and $b$ to determine their relative values.
5. Choose the answer that reflects the correct relationship between $a$ and $b$.
