Instructions:
1. Identify the slope of the line.
2. Remember that the slope represents the change in $y$ for every 1 unit change in $x$.
3. Starting from the origin, move the $x$ coordinate by the desired amount.
4. Calculate the corresponding change in $y$ based on the slope.
5. Move the $y$ coordinate by the calculated amount.
6. The resulting point lies on the line.
