Instructions:
1. Identify the change in $f(n)$ for each increase of 1 in $n$.
2. Calculate the slope of the function by dividing the change in $f(n)$ by the change in $n$.
3. Identify the value of $f(n)$ when $n$ is equal to the first value in the table.
4. Calculate the y-intercept of the function by subtracting the product of the slope and the first value of $n$ from the first value of $f(n)$.
5. Write the equation of the function in slope-intercept form: $f(n)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
