Instructions:
1. Identify the initial value (y-intercept).
2. Identify the rate of change (slope).
3. Determine the equation of the line using the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
4. Substitute the values of the slope and y-intercept into the equation.
5. Simplify the equation.
