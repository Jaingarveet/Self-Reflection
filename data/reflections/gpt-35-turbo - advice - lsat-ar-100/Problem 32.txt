Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conditions and constraints given in the problem.
 - Always make a list of the variables and their possible values.
 - Always use the conditions to eliminate the impossible values for each variable.
 - Always use the constraints to deduce the possible values for each variable.
 - Always check each option against the conditions and constraints to see if it is necessarily true or false.
 - Remember that not necessarily true means that it could be true or false, while necessarily true means that it must be true.
