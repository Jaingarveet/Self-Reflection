Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and answered incorrectly.

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

Here's why:

The line passes through the origin, so one of the points must be the origin. The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every $1$ unit of $x$, the line moves $7$ units to the right.

So, if the line passes through the origin, it must also pass through the point [REDACTED], since $14$ units to the right of the origin is $2$ units above the origin.
