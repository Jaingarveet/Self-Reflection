Explanation:
The formula $H=1.88L+32.01$ is used to approximate the height $H$, in inches, of an adult male based on the length $L$, in inches, of his femur. The value 1.88 in the formula represents the ratio of the height of the male to the length of his femur.

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

The formula $H=1.88L+32.01$ can be interpreted as the height of an adult male increases by $1.88$ inches for every one-inch increase in the length of his femur. Therefore, the value 1.88 represents the proportional relationship between the height and the femur length.

In this context, the value 1.88 is not the approximate femur length, as option (A) suggests, nor is it the approximate increase in a man's femur length for each increase of 32.01 inches in his height, as option (B) suggests. Nor is it the approximate increase in a man's femur length for each one-inch increase in his height, as option (C) suggests.

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
