Explanation:

The given equation is $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$. To solve for the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, we need to isolate the variable $x$.

I. $x = 4$

So, $x - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1$

Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 4$.

II. $x = 9$

So, $\sqrt{4x} = \sqrt{4(9)} = 9 - 3 = 6$

Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x = 9$.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")

Correct Answer: B

Explanation of the Correct Answer:

The correct answer is (B) because the equation $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$ can be solved for $x$ in two ways: $x = 4$ and $x = 9$. Therefore, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 4$ and $x = 9$.
