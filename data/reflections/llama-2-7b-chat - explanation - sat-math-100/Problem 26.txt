Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer by selecting option [REDACTED], which is not the correct sum of the two polynomials.

The correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

Here's why:

When adding the like terms of the two polynomials, we need to combine the identical terms, which are the terms that have the same degree (or power) and the same variable. In this case, the like terms are $x^2$ and $x^2$.

So, we can add the two $x^2$ terms to get:

$3 x^{2}-5 x+2 + 5 x^{2}-2 x-6 = 8 x^{2}-7 x-4$

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].
