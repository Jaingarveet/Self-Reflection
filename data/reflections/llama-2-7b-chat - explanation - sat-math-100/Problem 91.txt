Explanation:

I made a mistake in my previous answer. After reevaluating the table provided, I realized that the correct formula for the linear function $f$ is $f(n) = 3n - 5$.

Here's how I arrived at this answer:

1. Observe the pattern in the table: The values of $f$ for different values of $n$ are -2, 1, 4, and 7.
2. Identify the common difference between consecutive values of $f$: The common difference is 3.
3. Determine the formula for $f$: The formula for $f$ is $f(n) = 3n - 5$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $f(n) = 3n - 5$.
