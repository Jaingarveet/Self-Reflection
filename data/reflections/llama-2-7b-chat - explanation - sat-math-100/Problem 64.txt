Explanation:

Great job on solving the problem! You correctly identified the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ based on the given equation $3x - y = 12$. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the steps you took to arrive at the correct answer:

1. You recognized that to solve for the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$, you needed to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation and $y$ on the other side.
2. You subtracted $y$ from both sides of the equation to get $3x = 12 + y$, which simplified to $x = \frac{12 + y}{3}$.
3. You took the $y$th root of both sides of the equation to get $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{12}{3} + \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{y}{3}$.
[REDACTED]. You correctly identified the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ as $[REDACTED] = 2^{12}$.

Great job! Here are some tips to help you improve your problem-solving skills:

1. Read the question carefully: Make sure you understand what the question is asking and what information is given. In this case, the question asked for the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ based on the equation $3x - y = 12$.
2. Break down the problem: Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps. In this case, you correctly identified the steps needed to solve for $x$ and $y$ separately, and then combined them to find the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$.
3. Use the right tools: In this case, you used algebraic manipulations to solve for $x$ and $y$, and then combined them to find the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$. Make sure you have the right tools and techniques to solve the problem.
[REDACTED]. Check your work: Double-check your calculations to make sure you arrived at the correct answer. In this case, you correctly identified the value of $\frac{8^{x}}{2^{y}}$ as $[REDACTED] = 2^{12}$.

Keep up the good work!
