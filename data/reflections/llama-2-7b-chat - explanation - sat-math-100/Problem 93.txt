Explanation:

The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED].

To determine the category that accounts for approximately 19 percent of the survey respondents, we need to count the number of respondents in each category and then divide that number by the total number of respondents.

From the table, we can see that:

* 35 respondents are females taking Algebra I.
* 44 respondents are males taking Algebra II.
* 53 respondents are females taking Geometry.
* 57 respondents are males taking Geometry.
* 160 respondents are taking a total of 310 math courses.

Therefore, the number of respondents taking Geometry is:
53 + 57 = 110

And the number of respondents taking Algebra I is:
35

So, the proportion of respondents taking Geometry is:
110/310 = 0.357 (or approximately 19 percent)

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED].
