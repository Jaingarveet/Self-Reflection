Explanation:
You are correct that the equivalent of $4z + 8y$ in terms of the given equations is $(a + 2b)^2$. However, the correct answer is (B).

Here's why:

When you simplified the expression for $4z + 8y$, you wrote:

$4z + 8y = (a + 2b)^2$

But, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is (B): $(2a + 2b)^2$.

Here's how you can see this:

From the first equation, we know that $a^2 + b^2 = z$.

From the second equation, we know that $ab = y$.

Substituting these values into the equation for $4z + 8y$, we get:

$4z + 8y = (2a + 2b)^2$

So, the correct answer is (B): $(2a + 2b)^2$.

I hope this helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions.
