Explanation:

To find the probability that the winner will be either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older, we need to count the number of people in these two groups and divide it by the total number of people in the contest.

From the table, we can see that there are 8 females under age 40 and 3 males age 40 or older. Therefore, the total number of people in these two groups is 8 + 3 = 11.

The total number of people in the contest is 25, so the probability of the winner being either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older is:

Probability = Number of people in the desired group / Total number of people in the contest
= 11 / 25
= [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].
