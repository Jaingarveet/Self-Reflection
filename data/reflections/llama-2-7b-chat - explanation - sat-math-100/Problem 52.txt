Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly assumed that if Type [REDACTED] trees produced 20% more pears than Type [REDACTED] trees, then the production of Type [REDACTED] trees was 80% of the production of Type [REDACTED] trees. However, this is not the correct conclusion.

The correct reasoning is:
If Type [REDACTED] trees produced 20% more pears than Type [REDACTED] trees, then the production of Type [REDACTED] trees is 100% - 20% = 80% of the production of Type [REDACTED] trees.

So, if the Type [REDACTED] trees produced 144 pears, the Type [REDACTED] trees produced 80% of that amount, which is:
144 x 0.8 = [REDACTED] pears

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED] pears.
