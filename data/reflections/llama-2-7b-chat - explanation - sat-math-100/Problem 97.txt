Explanation:
I understand now that the function $h(x) = [REDACTED]^x$ means that $h(x)$ is equal to $[REDACTED]$ raised to the power of $x$. To find $h(5)-h(3)$, I evaluated $h(5)$ and $h(3)$ and then subtracted their values:

$h(5) = [REDACTED]^5 = 3[REDACTED]$

$h(3) = [REDACTED]^3 = 8$

$h(5) - h(3) = 3[REDACTED] - 8 = [REDACTED][REDACTED]$

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")

I hope this updated response meets your requirements. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
