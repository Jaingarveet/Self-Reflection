Explanation:

The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].

To find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point of the system of equations, we need to solve the first equation for $x$ and then substitute the solution into the second equation.

Solving the first equation for $x$, we get:

$2.4x - 1.5y = 0.3$

$x = 0.3 / 2.4$

$x = 0.125$

Now, substituting the value of $x$ into the second equation:

$1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3$

$1.6(0.125) + 0.5y = -1.3$

$0.19 + 0.5y = -1.3$

$0.7y = -1.41$

$y = -2.02$

Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $x = 0.125$, which corresponds to the answer (B) [REDACTED].

However, there is a mistake in the answer key. The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].
