Solution:
We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition allowed) out of 26, and then 2 digits out of 10.
Number of ways to choose 2 letters (with repetition) = 26 * 26 = 676 
Number of ways to choose 2 digits = 10 * 10 = 100
Total number of distinct bike numbers = 676 * 100 = 67600
