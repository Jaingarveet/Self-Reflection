Solution:
Each picket is 0.5 inches wide, and each space is 6 inches wide.
So, each picket-space unit is 0.5 + 6 = 6.5 inches wide.
With x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces between them. 
Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is 0.5x + 6(x-1) = 6.5x - 6.
Converting inches to feet (12 inches/foot) gives (6.5x - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24 feet.
