Solution:
Annual profit needed: $626,400
Monthly profit needed: $626,400 / 12 = $52,200
Units produced per month: 420
Required profit per unit: $52,200 / 420 = $124.2857... (keep the full decimal for now)
Production cost per unit: $110
Minimum selling price: $110 + $124.2857... = $234.2857...
Since the selling price must be an integer, we round up to the nearest dollar to ensure the profit target is met: $235
