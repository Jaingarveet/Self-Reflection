Solution:
The speed calculation was correct: 700 meters / 40 seconds = 17.5 meters per second.
The time to pass a point is also correct: 5 seconds.
However, the length of the space shuttle is not the distance it travels in those 5 seconds. The space shuttle travels its own length plus an additional distance in those 5 seconds. 
Let L be the length of the space shuttle.
In 5 seconds, the space shuttle travels 17.5 m/s * 5 s = 87.5 meters.
Therefore, L + 87.5 meters = 700 meters (the height it reaches in 40 seconds).
Solving for L, we get L = 700 meters - 87.5 meters = 612.5 meters.
Now, we need to find the distance the space shuttle travels in 5 seconds due to its own length.
This distance is 612.5 meters - 700 meters = -87.5 meters (negative because it's the distance traveled before reaching the 700m mark).
Finally, we divide this distance by the time to find the length of the space shuttle: -87.5 meters / 5 seconds = -17.5 meters/second.
Since the length cannot be negative, we take the absolute value, which is 17.5 meters/second.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 17.5 meters/second * 5 seconds = 87.5 meters.
The closest answer to this value is [REDACTED]eters.
