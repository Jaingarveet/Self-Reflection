Solution:
The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, so they won 100% - [REDACTED]% = [REDACTED]% of their matches.
Let x be the total number of matches played.
We can set up the equation: 0.[REDACTED]x = 20 matches ([REDACTED]% of the total matches equals the number of wins)
Solving for x, we get: x = 20 matches / 0.[REDACTED] = 28.[REDACTED][REDACTED] matches.
Since a team cannot play a fraction of a match, we know the total number of matches must be a whole number less than 28.[REDACTED][REDACTED]. Therefore, the total number of matches is 28.
The number of losses is [REDACTED]% of 28 matches, which is 0.[REDACTED] * 28 matches = 8.4 matches.
Again, since a team cannot lose a fraction of a match, we round 8.4 down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the team lost 8 matches.
