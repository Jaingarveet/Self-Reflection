Solution:
Let x be the number of months [REDACTED] invested after [REDACTED] joined.
A's investment: 40,000 * 12 = 480,000 (amount * time)
B's investment: 60,000 * (12-2) = 600,000
C's investment: 120,000 * x
Ratio of their profits = Ratio of their investments
C's profit share / Total profit = C's investment / Total investment
150,000 / 375,000 = (120,000 * x) / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x)
2/5 = x / (5 + x)
Solving for x, we get x = [REDACTED].
