Solution:
1. **Individual Non-Occurrence Probabilities:** Calculate the probabilities of each stock not increasing in value:
    - P(A' not increasing) = 1 - P(A' increasing) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
    - P(B' not increasing) = 1 - P(B' increasing) = 1 - 0.74 = [REDACTED]
2. **Maximum Joint Non-Occurrence Probability:** The maximum probability of neither event occurring is limited by the smaller individual non-occurrence probability. This is because if one event doesn't occur (with a certain probability), the probability of both not occurring cannot be greater than that. 
Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither event will occur is [REDACTED].
