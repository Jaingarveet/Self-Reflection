Explanation:
I misinterpreted the problem and provided an incorrect answer. The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]

The change in the problem from "What should I do to make money?" to "What can I do to be the best?" indicates that the focus has shifted from individual enterprises to the industry as a whole. This means that what was once good or bad for an individual enterprise may no longer be relevant in the new context of the industry.
