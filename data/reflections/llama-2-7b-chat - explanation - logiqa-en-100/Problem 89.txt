Explanation:

Based on the conditions provided, we need to assign the patients to the doctors in a way that meets all the requirements.

Dr.Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients, so he cannot treat J or K.
Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, so she cannot treat more than 1 patient.
Dr.Wang is responsible for treating adult patients, so he cannot treat J or K.

From the patient list, we can see that:

* J and K are children (male and female, respectively).
* E, F, and H are adults (male and female, respectively).

So, we need to assign J and K to doctors who are responsible for treating male patients, and E, F, and H to doctors who are responsible for treating adult patients.

The only possible assignment of patients to doctors is:

* J is treated by Dr.Li (as she is the only doctor who can treat a child patient and has no other patients to treat).
* K is treated by Dr.Wang (as he is the only doctor who can treat a child patient and has no other patients to treat).
* E is treated by Dr.Zhang (as he is the only doctor who can treat a male adult patient).
* F is treated by Dr.Liu (as she is the only doctor who can treat a female adult patient).
* H is treated by Dr.Li (as she is the only doctor who can treat a male adult patient).

Therefore, the answer is (B) [REDACTED] is treated by Dr.Liu.
