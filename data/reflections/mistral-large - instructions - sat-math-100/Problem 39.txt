Instructions:
1. Identify the slopes of the given equations.
2. Understand the conditions for a system of linear equations to have no solution.
[REDACTED]. Equate the slopes of the given equations.
4. Solve for the variable in the equation.
5. Check if the lines are the same by comparing their y-intercepts.
[REDACTED]. If the lines are the same, there are infinite solutions, not no solution.
7. If the lines are not the same, there is no solution.
8. Choose the answer that matches the value of the variable that results in no solution.
