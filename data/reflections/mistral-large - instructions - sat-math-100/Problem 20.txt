Instructions:
1. Identify the system of equations.
2. Choose a method to solve the system of equations (substitution or elimination).
3. Multiply the equations by appropriate values to eliminate decimal points and make the coefficients of one variable the same in both equations.
4. Subtract one equation from the other to eliminate one variable.
5. Solve for the remaining variable.
6. Substitute the value of the variable back into one of the equations to solve for the other variable.
7. Round the values of the variables to the nearest tenth to match the answer choices.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
