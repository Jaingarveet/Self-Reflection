Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option [REDACTED], which states that the Sun is near the end of its life cycle. However, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which states that the Sun has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.

The reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the context of the question. I thought the question was asking about the Sun's current energy state, rather than its overall energy consumption throughout its life cycle. As a result, I overlooked the important detail provided in the question about the Sun's expected fuel exhaustion in the future.
