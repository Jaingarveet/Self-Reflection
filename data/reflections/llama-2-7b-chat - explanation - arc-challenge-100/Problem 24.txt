Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between temperature and humidity on chemical weathering rates. I thought that cooler temperatures and higher humidity would result in the fastest rate of chemical weathering, but the correct answer is actually [REDACTED].

The rate of chemical weathering depends on the amount of water available for chemical reactions, and [REDACTED] typically have more water available for chemical weathering than [REDACTED]. Additionally, warm temperatures can increase the rate of chemical reactions, leading to faster weathering.
