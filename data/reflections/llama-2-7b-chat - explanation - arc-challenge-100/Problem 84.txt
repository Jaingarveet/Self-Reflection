Explanation:
I selected option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," as the correct answer, but upon further reflection, I realize that the addition of organic waste from fertilizers can actually lead to an increase in algae blooms in freshwater ecosystems.

Here's why:

When fertilizers containing organic materials are added to freshwater ecosystems, they provide a source of nutrients for algae to grow. Algae are microscopic plants that can multiply rapidly in response to an abundance of nutrients, leading to an overgrowth of algae known as an algae bloom.

Algal blooms can have negative impacts on freshwater ecosystems, including:

1. Decreased water clarity: As algae grow and die, they can cause the water to become cloudy or discolored.
2. Decreased oxygen levels: When algae decompose, they use up oxygen in the water, leading to low oxygen levels that can be harmful to aquatic life.
3. Increased risk of harmful algal blooms: Some algal blooms can produce toxins that are harmful to humans and wildlife.

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]."
