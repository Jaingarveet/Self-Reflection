Explanation:
I correctly identified the answer as "[REDACTED]" - "[REDACTED]"

The correct explanation is:
When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air can sublimate, meaning it changes directly from a liquid to a gas without going through the solid phase (i.e., ice). This process is known as sublimation, and it is the reason why frost forms on cold surfaces in winter.

So, the correct answer is "[REDACTED]" - "[REDACTED]"
