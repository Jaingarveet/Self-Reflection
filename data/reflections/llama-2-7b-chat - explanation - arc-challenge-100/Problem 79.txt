Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is indeed (D) [REDACTED].

The process of digestion involves [REDACTED], but this does not indicate a physical change. The digestive juices in the stomach and small intestine do not physically change the food, but rather break down its molecular bonds through chemical reactions.

The squeezing of food through the intestines, on the other hand, is a physical process that occurs after the food has been broken down. The intestines contract and relax to move the digested food through the digestive system, and this process can be considered a physical change.

So, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

Keywords: digestion, digestive juices, molecular bonds, physical change, intestines.
