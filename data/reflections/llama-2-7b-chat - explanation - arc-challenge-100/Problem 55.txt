Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as there is a mistake in my reasoning. I thought that as water changes state from steam to liquid, the molecules slow down and move closer together, which is not the correct explanation.

The correct statement that best describes the motion of water molecules as the water changes state from steam to liquid is:
