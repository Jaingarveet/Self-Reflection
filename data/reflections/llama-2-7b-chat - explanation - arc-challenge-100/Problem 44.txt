Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of forces and their impact on an object's motion.

The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]

When the toy car rolls down the inclined track, it experiences a force due to gravity, which is acting downward. As the car reaches the flat surface, the force of gravity acting on the car does not change, but the car's speed decreases due to the lack of friction on the flat surface. This means that the forces acting on the car are not balanced, as there is no opposing force to counteract the force of gravity. As a result, the car's speed decreases.
