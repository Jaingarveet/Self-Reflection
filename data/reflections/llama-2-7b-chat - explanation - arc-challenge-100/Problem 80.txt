Explanation:
I correctly identified that heat is being transferred by convection in the scenario of the spoon stirring the soup. However, my answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]. When the spoon stirs the soup, it creates circular motion that moves the hot soup away from the spoon and carries the heat to the surrounding air, which is an example of convection.
