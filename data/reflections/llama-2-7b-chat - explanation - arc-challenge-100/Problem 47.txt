Explanation:
I incorrectly selected answer "[REDACTED]" as the correct response. The correct answer is actually "[REDACTED]".

The oil spill will likely have a negative impact on the coastal habitat, including:

* Harming or killing marine life, including fish, birds, and other organisms that depend on the coastal ecosystem.
* Coating or smothering plants and habitats, reducing their ability to photosynthesize and providing shelter for marine life.
* Altering the water's chemistry, reducing the amount of oxygen available and affecting the overall health of the ecosystem.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of how the oil spill will affect the coastal habitat:

* Option "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because oil spills can actually have a negative impact on fish reproduction rates, rather than increasing them.
* Option "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because oil spills can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching water plants, rather than exposing them to more sunlight.
* Option "[REDACTED]" is incorrect because coastal plants may not have access to more nutrients as a result of an oil spill.
