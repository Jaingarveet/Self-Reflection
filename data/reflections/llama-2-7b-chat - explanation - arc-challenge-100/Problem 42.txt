Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by selecting option [REDACTED], which states that the object will [REDACTED] However, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], which states that the object will [REDACTED]

The reason for my mistake is that I misunderstood the concept of forces acting in opposite directions. I thought that the object would continue to move in the same direction due to the equal and opposite forces, but in reality, the object will accelerate in the direction of the larger force.
