Explanation:
I selected option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option is not the best choice.

When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations. Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," is a more appropriate response in this situation.

Here's why:

Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," may be necessary if the initial investigation was flawed or if there were limitations to the methodology that could have affected the results. However, if the results do not match the hypothesis, it is important to consider alternative explanations and revise the hypothesis accordingly.

Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," is not the best choice because it does not address the issue of the discrepancy between the results and the hypothesis.

Option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]," is a good choice because it allows Michelle to gather more data and potentially obtain more accurate results. However, it is important to note that repeating the investigation without addressing the issues with the initial investigation may lead to the same results.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]."
