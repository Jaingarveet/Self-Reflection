Explanation:
I correctly identified the characteristic that must be different between the two samples based on the information provided in the question. However, I made a mistake in my answer choice.

The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED]

The two pieces of metal have the same density, mass, and texture, which means they are made of the same type of matter. The only difference between the two samples is their size, as they have different dimensions.
