Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly. The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED] Paleontologists cannot infer the skin color of a dinosaur from its fossil bones and teeth. While the fossil record can provide information about a dinosaur's diet, length, and type of food it ate, it does not contain any clues about its skin color.
