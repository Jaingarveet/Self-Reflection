Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer [REDACTED], "It is made up of more than one substance," as the reason why the snack is a mixture. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"

[REDACTED] mixture is a combination of two or more substances that maintain their original properties. In the case of the snack, each ingredient (peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces) retains its original properties, such as taste, texture, and chemical composition, even when mixed together. Therefore, the snack is a mixture.
