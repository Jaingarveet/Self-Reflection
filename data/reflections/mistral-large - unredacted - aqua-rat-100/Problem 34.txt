Reflection:

1. Why I answered incorrectly:
I made a calculation error when finding the cost price of the book. I divided the selling price by (1 + 10/100) instead of (1 - 10/100). This resulted in an incorrect cost price, which led to an incorrect percentage of loss.
2. Error keywords:
   - Calculation error
   - Arithmetic error
   - Division error
3. Correct solution:
   - Find the cost price of the book: Rs 27.50 / (1 - 10/100) = Rs 250/9
   - Calculate the loss if the book were sold for Rs 25.75: Rs 250/9 - Rs 25.75 = Rs 0.25
   - Calculate the percentage of loss: (Rs 0.25 / Rs 250/9) x 100 = 3%
   - The correct answer is "B: 3% Loss."
