Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation when solving the quadratic equation.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the concept of arithmetic progression but in solving the quadratic equation.
I knew the correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Quadratic equation error
 - Factoring error
Solution:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.
To find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
Sum = n * (2a + (n - 1) * d) / 2
where Sum is the sum of the ages (250), a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (1/4), and n is the number of terms (members).
We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:
n = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)
Substituting the given values:
n = (250 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
We can simplify and solve for n:
n = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
n = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)
n = 500 / (13 + n/4)
4n = 2000 / (13 + n/4)
4n(13 + n/4) = 2000
52n + n^2 = 2000
n^2 + 52n - 2000 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation:
(n - 25)(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are 25 and -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members is 25.
Instructions:
1. Identify the ages of the members as an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
2. Identify the youngest member as 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.
3. Identify the sum of the ages of all the members as 250 years.
4. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression to solve for the number of members (n).
5. Rearrange the formula to solve for n.
6. Substitute the given values into the formula.
7. Simplify and solve for n.
8. Factor the quadratic equation to find the possible values for n.
9. Choose the positive value for n as the number of members.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to factor the quadratic equation correctly to find the possible values for n.
 - Always choose the positive value for n as the number of members.
