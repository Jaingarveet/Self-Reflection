Explanation:
I made an error in simplifying the expression for x.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebraic manipulation.
I incorrectly canceled out the common factor of (n + 4√n + 4) from the numerator and denominator.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Canceling error
 - Simplification error
Solution:
First, let's simplify the expression for x:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Notice that the numerator is a perfect square trinomial:
x = (n + √n + 4)^2 / (n + 4√n + 4)

Now, let's multiply the conjugate of the denominator to the numerator and denominator:
x = (n + √n + 4)^2 / (n + 4√n + 4) \* (n - 4√n + 4) / (n - 4√n + 4)

Simplify the expression:
x = (n^2 - 16) / (n - 4√n + 4)

Now, let's substitute the minimum and maximum values of n to find the range of x:

For n = 36:
x = (36^2 - 16) / (36 - 4√36 + 4) = 28

For n = 72:
x = (72^2 - 16) / (72 - 4√72 + 4) = 60

So, the range of x is 28 ≤ x ≤ 60.

Instructions:
1. Simplify the expression for x.
2. Multiply the conjugate of the denominator to the numerator and denominator.
3. Simplify the expression.
4. Substitute the minimum and maximum values of n to find the range of x.
5. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that canceling out common factors is only valid when the entire expression is a factor of both the numerator and denominator.
 - Always multiply the conjugate of the denominator to the numerator and denominator when simplifying expressions with square roots.
