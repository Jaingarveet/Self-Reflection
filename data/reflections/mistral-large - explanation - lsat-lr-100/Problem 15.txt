Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the flaw in Morgenstern's argument.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the nuances of the argument and the different types of risks involved.
I focused on the assumption that the only risk involved in quitting a job is not finding another one, but failed to consider the possibility that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance.
