Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the ethicist's argument about feelings and control, rather than the logical assumption required for the conclusion to follow.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the subject matter but in understanding the logical structure of the argument.
I knew the ethicist's conclusion but misidentified the assumption required for it to follow logically.
