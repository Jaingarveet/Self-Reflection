Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the assumption that the argument was based on the breed of the dog, rather than the licensing behavior of the dog owners.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in critical thinking and reasoning.
I misunderstood the argument and did not consider the importance of licensing behavior in evaluating the argument.
