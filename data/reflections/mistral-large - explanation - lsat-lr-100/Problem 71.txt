Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the wrong aspect of the curator's statements. I focused on the fact that the museum store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection, which are all twentieth-century works, and that the store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. However, I failed to consider the fact that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
