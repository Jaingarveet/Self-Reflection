Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the principle illustrated by the argument. I thought that the principle was that illegal actions cannot be punished if the evidence was obtained illegally. However, the principle is actually that illegal actions cannot be punished if the evidence was obtained through illegal means by the person or entity seeking to punish the wrongdoer.
