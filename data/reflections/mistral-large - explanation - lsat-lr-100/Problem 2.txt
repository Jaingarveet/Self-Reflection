Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the given statements and failed to consider all possible scenarios.
The gap in my knowledge was in logical reasoning and critical thinking.
I misunderstood the relationship between the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and the films that won prizes at international film festivals.
I also failed to consider the possibility that some films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival may not have been shown at international film festivals.
