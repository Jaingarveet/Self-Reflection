Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the behavior of smokers rather than the physiological limit of nicotine absorption.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in understanding the biological mechanism of nicotine absorption.
I misunderstood the finding of the study and did not consider the possibility that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine than a certain limit.
