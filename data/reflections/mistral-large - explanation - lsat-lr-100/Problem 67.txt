Explanation:
I misunderstood the argument's main point and its relationship to the statement "that we should learn the lessons of history."
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument's purpose and the role of the statement in the argument.
I thought the argument was designed to resolve the problem of learning the lessons of history, but the argument is actually directed toward discrediting the idea that we should learn the lessons of history.
