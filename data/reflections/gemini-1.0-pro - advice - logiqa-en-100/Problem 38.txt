Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how the evidence supports the conclusion.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that introduce new information not mentioned in the argument.
 - Remember that the goal is to weaken the argument, not necessarily to prove it wrong.
 - Look for answer choices that directly contradict the evidence or provide alternative explanations for the observed現象.
