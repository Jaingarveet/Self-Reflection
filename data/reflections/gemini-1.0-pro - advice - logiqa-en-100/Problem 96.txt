Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the question.
- Consider all aspects of the argument, not just the ones that are explicitly stated.
- Be aware of your own biases and assumptions, and try to set them aside when evaluating the argument.
- Think critically about the answer choices and choose the one that is most logically sound.
