Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical structure of the argument and how each option interacts with it.
 - Be wary of options that seem intuitively appealing but do not directly address the argument.
 - Remember that the goal is to identify the option that casts doubt on or refutes the argument, not necessarily the option that is most obviously wrong.
