Instructions:

1. Identify the principle of combinatorics or permutations that applies to the problem.
2. Count the number of elements in the set (in this case, the number of oranges in the basket).
3. Use the principle of combinatorics or permutations to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of that size.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
