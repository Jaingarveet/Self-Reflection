Solution:
The original argument assumes that because most auto mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, then most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for the possibility that some mechanics with extensive experience may not understand electronic circuits. 
The argument that most closely follows this flawed reasoning is choice [REDACTED]. It assumes that because most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer and most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers, then most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for the possibility that some snow-removal companies that run lawn-care services may not hire additional workers.
