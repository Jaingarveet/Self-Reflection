Solution:
The study shows that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers are the same at the end of the day, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the amount of nicotine absorbed is not directly related to the nicotine content in the cigarettes. The best explanation for this would be that there is a physiological limit to how much nicotine the blood can absorb in a day, as indicated by option [REDACTED]. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
