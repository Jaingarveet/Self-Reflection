Solution:
The argument in the editorial is pointing out an inconsistency in the political party's stance on education spending. It assumes that if a party believes increasing spending on education is a worthy goal, they should not also argue against increasing spending on education. This is most closely related to choice [REDACTED], which states that a consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
