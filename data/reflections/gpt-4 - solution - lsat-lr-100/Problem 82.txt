Solution:
Tamara's argument is that the wealthy Japanese feared ninjas, as evidenced by their construction of squeaky floors to detect them. Patricia can counter this by pointing out that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period. This means that even if the wealthy feared ninjas, most Japanese did not, supporting Patricia's original claim.
