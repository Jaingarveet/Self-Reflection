Solution:
The archaeologist's argument is that the mosaics should have been left in place because we had all the necessary information and their removal might mislead future archaeologists. The assumption that would most help to justify this reasoning is that the only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological (Choice A). This assumption implies that other potential reasons for removing the mosaics, such as preservation or display in a museum, are not relevant to the decision.
