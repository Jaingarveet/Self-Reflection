Solution:
The ethicist's argument is based on the interpretation of the promise in marital vows. The argument states that if "love" refers to a feeling, then the promise makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control. Therefore, the assumption that makes this argument logically sound is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes no sense. Hence, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
