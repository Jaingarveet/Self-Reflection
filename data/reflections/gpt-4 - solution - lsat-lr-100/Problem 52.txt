Solution:
The original argument follows this pattern: If [REDACTED] (squirrels eat from a bird feeder), then [REDACTED] (it will not attract many birds). However, [REDACTED] only happens if [REDACTED] (it lacks a protective cover). So, if [REDACTED], then [REDACTED]. This pattern is most similar to choice [REDACTED]: If [REDACTED] (tire's pressure is too low), then [REDACTED] (the tire will wear out prematurely). But [REDACTED] will happen only if [REDACTED] (the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly). So, if [REDACTED], then [REDACTED].
