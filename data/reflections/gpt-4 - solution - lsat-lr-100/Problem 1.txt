Solution:
The statements indicate that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees. This implies that most parts of the country are either not humid (to allow for cacti growth) or not cold (to allow for orange tree growth). However, if half of the country is both humid and cold (Choice A), it would be difficult to grow both cacti and orange trees, contradicting the initial statements. Therefore, Choice [REDACTED] must be false.
