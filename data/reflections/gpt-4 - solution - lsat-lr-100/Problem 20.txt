Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the principle that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. Therefore, if the defendant had been charged with noncompliance with local codes, his confusion about which codes applied might have been a valid excuse. However, since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable. The correct answer is [REDACTED].
