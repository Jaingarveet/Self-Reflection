Advice:

* Always consider all the possible combinations of points to form a quadrilateral.
* Don't limit your thinking to a small number of possibilities.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the number of quadrilaterals that can be formed is directly proportional to the number of points chosen from each side of the pentagon.
