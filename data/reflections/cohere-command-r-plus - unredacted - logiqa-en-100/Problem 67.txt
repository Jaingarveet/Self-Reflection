Explanation:
I misinterpreted the argument's assumption. 
I focused on the idea that the official history may not provide a complete picture, but I overlooked the key point that combining both sources is necessary to understand the true face of the emperor. 
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Misunderstanding
- Assumption error
Solution:
The argument states that the official history of China has been the diary of the emperor's family, known as "Zhengshi." 
However, it suggests that to understand the true face of the emperor, one must also read "Ye Shi," which portrays the emperor's life. 
The assumption is that only by combining these two perspectives, the official history, and the portrayal of the emperor's life, can one see the emperor's true face. 
This assumption is reflected in option C.
Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's conclusion: to understand the true face of the emperor, one must read Ye Shi.
2. Determine the gap in information: why is Ye Shi necessary if the official history is the emperor's diary?
3. Analyze the options: which choice fills this gap and provides the missing link?
4. Evaluate each choice: does it provide a valid reason for the argument's conclusion?
5. Double-check your interpretation: does the chosen assumption align with the argument's logic?
Advice:
- Understand the context and identify the argument's conclusion.
- Look for gaps in information or unstated premises.
- Analyze each option critically and fill in those gaps.
- Ensure that the chosen assumption logically supports the argument's conclusion.
- Avoid personal interpretations or biases; focus on the information provided.
