Explanation: I misinterpreted the question and focused on implied assumptions rather than the core assumption that connects the context to the conclusion. I overlooked the assumption that connects the image-thinking methods of Nobel Prize winners to their scientific breakthroughs.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Oversight
- Assumption error

Solution: The context states that Nobel Prize winners utilize image-thinking methods more frequently than ordinary scientists. The conclusion asserts that image-thinking methods lead to major scientific breakthroughs. The underlying assumption that connects these statements is that Nobel Prize winners have achieved these breakthroughs through their use of image-thinking methods. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the context and the conclusion. 
2. Understand the relationship between them and the underlying assumption. 
3. Analyze each choice and determine if it reflects this core assumption. 
4. Choice C directly expresses this assumption and is, therefore, the correct answer. 

Advice: 
 - Focus on the core relationship between the context and the conclusion. 
 - Ensure you understand the underlying assumptions that connect the statements. 
 - Avoid overcomplicating the problem by focusing on peripheral or implied assumptions. 
 - Always read and interpret the question and choices carefully.
