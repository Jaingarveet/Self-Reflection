Explanation: I misinterpreted the meaning of "raising doubts." I focused on directly contradicting the expert opinion and overlooked the aspect of providing alternative explanations for the number decline. My error was in the logical interpretation of the question.

Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Logical error
- Misunderstanding

Solution: 
The correct answer is B. Choice B provides an alternative explanation for the decline in salamander numbers, suggesting that a change in rainfall and groundwater levels has affected their water source environment. This raises doubts about the expert opinion that trampling by cattle and sheep is the primary cause of the decline.

Instructions: 
1. Understand the question: Identify what the question is asking for, which is to find the option that raises the most doubts about the experts' opinions.
2. Interpret the context: Understand the information provided, including the experts' opinions on the decline of the northern salamander population in Xinjiang.
3. Analyze each choice: 
A) Supports the experts' opinion and local protection efforts, does not raise doubts.
B) Provides an alternative explanation for the population decline, unrelated to trampling, and raises doubts about the sole blame on trampling.
C) Describes the salamander's behavior, which does not directly contradict the expert opinion or provide an alternative explanation for the decline.
D) Discusses tourist access, which is irrelevant to the expert opinion on trampling.

4. Evaluate and select: Choice B provides new information that could explain the decline and casts doubt on the exclusivity of the trampling hypothesis.
