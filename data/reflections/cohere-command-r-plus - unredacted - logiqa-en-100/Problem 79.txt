Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the meaning of "rebuttal" and "doubt" in the context of the question. 
I focused too narrowly on the concept of "visual experience" and its reliability, rather than considering the broader argument about the existence of an external world and the role of natural science in supporting or refuting this claim. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Narrow focus
 - Ignoring broader context
Solution: 
The argument claims that an external world exists because of our visual experiences and the success of natural science.

Choice A: This statement questions the validity of using sensory evidence, implying that the existence of an external world is already assumed in the mind. It does not directly support or align with the argument and can be seen as a doubt or rebuttal.

Choice B: Questioning how we know that others share similar visual experiences does not directly refute the argument's claim about the existence of an external world. It is a valid point but does not constitute a strong doubt or rebuttal.

Choice C: Affirming the reliability of visual experiences and claiming that mirages are real does not rebut or doubt the argument. It supports the idea that sensory evidence is valid.

Choice D: This choice brings up a critical point. It questions why natural science has achieved success if there is no external world for it to reflect and operate upon. This choice directly challenges the argument's claim that natural science supports the existence of an external world. Therefore, it does not constitute doubt or rebuttal.

The correct answer is, indeed, choice D.

Instructions: 
1. Understand the argument presented and identify its key claims and evidence.
2. Interpret what it means for a choice to "constitute doubt or rebuttal" to the argument.
3. Analyze each choice:
   - A: Consider if it questions or challenges the argument's assumptions or conclusions.
   - B: Assess if it directly refutes the argument's claim or raises a significant doubt.
   - C: Evaluate if it aligns with or supports the argument's reasoning.
   - D: Examine if it offers an alternative explanation or challenges the argument's core premise.
4. Recognize that a rebuttal or doubt should directly engage with and challenge the argument's central claim or evidence.
5. Avoid narrow interpretations and consider the broader implications and connections.

Advice: 
 - Always read and understand the argument and the question thoroughly.
 - Carefully interpret the specific requirements of the question, such as "doubt" or "rebuttal."
 - Consider all choices and evaluate them critically and independently.
 - Avoid narrow focus; consider the broader context and implications of the argument and choices.
 - Recognize that doubts or rebuttals should directly challenge or question the argument's core claims or evidence.
