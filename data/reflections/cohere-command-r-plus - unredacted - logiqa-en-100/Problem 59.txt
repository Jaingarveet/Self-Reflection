Explanation: 
I made a mistake in interpreting condition (3). "If X is allocated to the sales department, W is allocated to the production department" does not mean that X and W must be in different departments, as I initially assumed. Instead, it means that if X is in sales, then W will be in production, but it does not restrict their allocation if X is not in sales.

Solution: 
Given the conditions: 
1. H and Y must be in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be in the same department. 
3. The relationship between X and W: if X is in sales, then W is in production. This condition does not restrict their allocation if X is not in sales. 
4. F must be in the production department. 

Deductions: 
1. H and Y are allocated to the same department, which could be production or sales, but not public relations. 
2. F is allocated to the production department. This means G is allocated to either sales or public relations, as they cannot be in the same department. 
3. X and W are not restricted to specific departments unless X is allocated to sales, in which case W will be in production. 

Now, evaluating the choices: 
Choice A: 
- H and Y are in the production department, satisfying condition 1. 
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4. 
- G is in sales, satisfying the deduction that G should be in sales or public relations. 
- However, this allocation does not satisfy condition 3 because if X is in sales, W should be in production, but in this choice, W is allocated to public relations. 

Choice B: 
- H and Y are in the production department, satisfying condition 1.
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4.
- G is in sales, satisfying the deduction that G should be in sales or public relations.
- However, this allocation implies that X is not in sales, which contradicts condition 3. Therefore, this choice is invalid. 

Choice C: 
- H and Y are in sales, satisfying condition 1. 
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4. 
- G is in production, contradicting condition 2, as F and G should not be in the same department. 

Choice D: 
- H and Y are in sales, satisfying condition 1.
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4.
- G is in sales, satisfying the deduction that G should be in sales or public relations, and also satisfying condition 2 as F and G are not in the same department. 
- X is in public relations, which satisfies condition 3 because X is not in sales, so there is no restriction on W's department. W can be allocated to production. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given conditions and understand their implications. 
2. Deduce the possible allocations for each employee based on the conditions. 
3. Evaluate each choice systematically, checking if it satisfies all the conditions. 
4. Ensure that your interpretation of the conditions is correct, especially the relationships between employees. 
5. Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the conditions. 

Advice: 
 - Read and understand the conditions carefully to avoid misinterpretation. 
 - Break down complex conditions into simpler statements to facilitate logical reasoning. 
 - Consider the implications of each condition individually and in combination. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that are not directly supported by the given conditions. 
 - Double-check your deductions and ensure they align with the conditions provided. 
 - Systematically evaluate each choice, checking for consistency with all conditions.
