Explanation: 
I incorrectly identified the assumptions and their roles in the inference. 
I overlooked the fact that assumption A, "Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's," is not necessary for the inference and, therefore, could be the correct answer.

Error Keywords:
- Logical error
- Assumption error
- Oversight

Solution: 
Given:
- Zhang Shan's bonus > Li Si's bonus
- Wang Wu's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus
- Zhang Shan's bonus > Wang Wu's bonus

Inference: Zhang Shan's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus

To make the inference hold, we need to assume that:
1. Li Si's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus (from 1 and inference)
2. Wang Wu's bonus > Li Si's bonus (from 3 and 1)

Assumption A: Wang Wu's bonus > Li Si's bonus. This assumption is not necessary for the inference, as it does not provide any additional information.

Assumption B: Li Si's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus. This assumption is implicit in the inference and, therefore, is not an exception.

Assumption C: There is no such assumption. This choice is irrelevant to the inference.

Assumption D: There is no such assumption. This statement directly contradicts the given information and cannot be true.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice A, as it is the only assumption that is not required for the inference to hold.

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given information and the inference.
2. Determine the assumptions required for the inference to hold.
3. Analyze each choice:
   - Does it provide additional information that supports the inference?
   - Is it implicit in the given information or inference?
   - Is it irrelevant or contradictory?
4. Identify the choice that is not necessary for the inference.
5. Double-check your reasoning and the correct answer. 

Advice: 
 - Always identify the given information and the inference clearly.
 - Decompose complex logical statements into simple, explicit assumptions.
 - Analyze each assumption critically and independently. 
 - Understand the role of each assumption in supporting the inference. 
 - Avoid making assumptions that are implicit in the given information or inference. 
 - Recognize that irrelevant or contradictory statements cannot be correct assumptions. 
 - Always test your reasoning by verifying that the inference does not hold when the correct assumption is removed.
