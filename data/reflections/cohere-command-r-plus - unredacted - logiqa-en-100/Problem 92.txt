Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the relationships between the professors' statements and the correctness of their judgments. I incorrectly identified Professor Qian's statements as both correct, when in fact, one was incorrect. 

Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Logical reasoning error
- Misunderstanding

Solution: 
The question states that one professor is entirely correct, one is entirely wrong, and the remaining professor has one correct and one incorrect statement. 

Professor Zhao's statement is incorrect because it is given that one of the teams mentioned must be the champion. 

Professor Sun's statement is entirely wrong because his judgment contradicts Professor Qian, who we know has one correct statement. 

Therefore, Professor Qian has one correct and one incorrect statement. His statement about the champion not being Tsinghua University is correct, implying that the other part of his statement, about the University of Science and Technology of China, must be incorrect. 

As a result, the Tsinghua University Team must be the champion. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify and understand the relationships between the professors' statements. 
2. Determine which professor is entirely correct, entirely wrong, and partially correct. 
3. Analyze the implications of each professor's statements on the others. 
4. Identify the team that is consistently implied to be the champion.
