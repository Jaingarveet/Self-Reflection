Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the conditions and made an incorrect inference about the relationship between papers G and K. I overlooked the fact that statement 3 tells us that if paper G is not used, then paper K is also not needed, but it does not imply the reverse. Therefore, statement D is not correct.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Inference error
- Overlooked condition

Solution: 
Given: 
(1) If paper E is used, then not F and must K.
(2) G or H can only use one, and J must not be used.
(3) If G is not needed, K is not needed.
(4) Paper E cannot be used.

Statement (4) tells us that paper E is not an option. From statement (1), we know that if E is not used, there is no restriction on paper K. Therefore, paper K can be used or not used independently. Statement (3) tells us that if paper G is not needed, then paper K is also not needed, but the reverse is not true. Paper K can be used or not without any implication for paper G.

From the given conditions, we can determine that paper J cannot be used (from statement 2). Therefore, statement C is true - no paper J, but paper K is possible.

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given conditions and statements.
2. Understand the relationships and restrictions between the papers.
3. Interpret the statements correctly, paying attention to the precise wording.
4. Determine the implications of each statement on the usage of the other papers.
5. Consider all possibilities and avoid making assumptions.
6. Double-check your interpretation and reasoning.
7. Choose the answer that aligns with the given conditions.

Advice: 
 - Read and understand the context and statements carefully.
 - Clearly identify the relationships and restrictions between the options.
 - Interpret the statements precisely, avoiding assumptions or oversimplifications.
 - Consider all possibilities and avoid making hasty conclusions.
 - Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with the given conditions.
 - Practice similar problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
