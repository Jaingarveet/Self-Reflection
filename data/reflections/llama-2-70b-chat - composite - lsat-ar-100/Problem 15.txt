Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrectly answered the question.
The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
I incorrectly placed the veterinarian in space 5, thinking it had to be next to the optometrist or the pharmacy.
However, the veterinarian can be in space 4, next to the pharmacy, and still satisfy all the constraints.
Error Keywords:
 - Reasoning error
 - Placement error
 - Misunderstanding of constraints
Solution:
Start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row.
One of the restaurants must be in space 7, so place it there.
The other restaurant must be separated by at least two other businesses, so place it in space 3.
The optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, so place it in space 2.
The veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy or the optometrist, so place it in space 4.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so place it in space 6.
The shoe store is in space 4, so it is next to the veterinarian.
Instructions:
1. Start by placing the pharmacy in space 1.
2. Place one of the restaurants in space 7.
3. Place the other restaurant in space 3.
4. Place the optometrist in space 2.
5. Place the veterinarian in space 4.
6. Place the toy store in space 6.
