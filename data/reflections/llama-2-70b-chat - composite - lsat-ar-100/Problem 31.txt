Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I thought that the second batch of oatmeal cookies was made on the same day as the first batch of sugar cookies, rather than the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This led me to incorrectly determine the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie were made.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of conditions
* Incorrect application of logic

Solution:
I should have carefully read and understood the conditions of the problem before applying logic to determine the answer. I should have noticed that the second batch of oatmeal cookies was made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and not the first batch of sugar cookies.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Identify the first batch of each kind of cookie.
3. Determine the day on which the second batch of each kind of cookie is made based on the conditions.
4. Determine the day on which the third batch of each kind of cookie is made based on the conditions.
5. List the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie are made.
6. Compare the list to the answer choices and choose the correct one.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions before applying logic.
* Pay close attention to the details of the problem and avoid making assumptions.
* Use a systematic approach to determine the answer by breaking down the problem into smaller parts.
* Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
* Consider all possible answer choices before selecting the correct one.
