Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions.
I assumed that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, which is not explicitly stated in the problem.
I also assumed that the two restaurants must be separated by exactly two other businesses, which is also not stated.
Furthermore, I did not consider the possibility that the veterinarian could be in space 5, which would affect the placement of the other businesses.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding of the problem
- Incorrect assumptions
- Lack of consideration of all possible scenarios
Solution:
We are given that the veterinarian is in space 5.
We can start by placing the pharmacy in space 7, as it must be at one end of the row.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we can place one restaurant in space 1 and the other in space 4.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so we can place the optometrist in space 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can place it in space 3.
The shoe store can be placed in space 2.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
2. Start by placing the businesses that have specific placement constraints, such as the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
3. Place the remaining businesses in the available spaces, ensuring that the constraints are met.
4. Check the placement of each business to ensure that it meets the constraints.
5. Double-check the placement of all the businesses to ensure that there are no errors.
Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
- Start by placing the businesses that have specific placement constraints.
- Use a systematic approach to place the remaining businesses, ensuring that the constraints are met.
- Double-check the placement of all the businesses to ensure that there are no errors.
- Consider all possible scenarios and do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
