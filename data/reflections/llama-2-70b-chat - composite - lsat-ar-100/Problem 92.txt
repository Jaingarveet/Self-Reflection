Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and answer.
I correctly identified that Quinn cannot work in Zone 1, but I incorrectly concluded that Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
I mistakenly assumed that [REDACTED] works in Zone 2, which is not stated in the conditions.
Error Keywords:
- Logical reasoning error
- Inference error
- Assumption error
Solution:
Either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1.
Either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2.
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same sales zone as each other.
There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
Parra cannot work in Zone 1 if [REDACTED] works in Zone 1.
Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
[REDACTED] or [REDACTED] works in Zone 2.
Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
The only option that satisfies this condition is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the conditions carefully and understand the relationships between the sales representatives and sales zones.
2. Identify the constraints that apply to each sales representative and sales zone.
3. Use a process of elimination to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with.
4. Check your answer against the conditions to ensure it satisfies all the constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that assumptions not stated in the conditions can lead to incorrect conclusions.
