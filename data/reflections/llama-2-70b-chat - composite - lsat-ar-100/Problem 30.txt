Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here's the corrected explanation:

If the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, we can deduce the following:

1. The first and second solos are performed by the same pianist.
2. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, and no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece, Wayne must perform a modern piece before the third solo.
3. Therefore, the second solo must be a modern piece.
4. Since exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the fourth solo must be a traditional piece.
5. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo, so Zara must perform the fifth solo.

Thus, the answer is "[REDACTED]" - [REDACTED]
