Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the question, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The reasoning is as follows:

1. J must be shown in the evening.
2. K cannot be shown in the morning.
3. L must be shown after K and before M.
4. M must be shown after L.
5. N and O must be shown after M.
6. P must be shown after K.

Given these constraints, the only possible way to show P after J is to show J in the evening, followed by K, L, M, N, O, and finally P. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this corrected answer helps clarify the solution to the problem.
