Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The reason for this is that if Novetzke is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne or Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two countries. However, we know that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the other two countries, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the other two countries. Therefore, it is not possible for Novetzke to be assigned to Zambia without violating the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

The other options are not necessarily false:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
If Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
As mentioned above, if Kayne is assigned to Zambia, Jaramillo must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
If Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned to one of the other two countries. This is possible, so this option is not necessarily false.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
