Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by stating that none of the given options must be true of the schedule. However, upon closer examination, I realized that option [REDACTED] - Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday - must be true given the conditions provided.

Error Keywords:

* Overlooked requirement
* Insufficient information

Solution:
Let's revisit the given conditions:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies.
2. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
3. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

We know that Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday. Therefore, we can fill in the schedule as follows:

* Monday: Jackson
* Tuesday: Hong and Garcia (since Garcia can't testify on Monday and Hong can't testify on Wednesday)
* Wednesday: Iturbe

Now, we can see that condition 1 is met since Franco doesn't testify on Tuesday. Condition 2 is also met since Hong and Garcia testify on Tuesday. Condition 3 is met since Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Condition 4 is met since Hong doesn't testify on Monday. Condition 5 is met since Jackson testifies on Monday.

Given the schedule, we can see that option [REDACTED] - Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday - must be true.

Instructions:

1. Re-read the question and given conditions carefully.
2. Fill in the schedule with the given conditions.
3. Check if each condition is met.
4. Identify the correct answer based on the schedule.
