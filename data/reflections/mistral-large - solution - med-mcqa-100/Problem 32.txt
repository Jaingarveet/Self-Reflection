Solution:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who presents with right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood-tinged. The biopsy finding shows granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and areas of necrosis. However, the absence of fungal or bacterial infection on the biopsy does not rule out an infectious etiology. [REDACTED] is a chronic granulomatous infection that commonly affects the nasal mucosa and presents with similar symptoms. The diagnosis can be confirmed by identifying the characteristic spores of Rhinosporidium seeberi on histopathology.
