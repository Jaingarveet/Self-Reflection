Solution:
The uterine tube, also known as the fallopian tube, has four parts: the infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus, and interstitial.
The infundibulum is the funnel-shaped opening of the tube near the ovary.
The ampulla is the widest and longest part of the tube.
The isthmus is the narrowest part of the tube, located near the uterus.
The interstitial part is the narrowest part of the tube, located within the muscular wall of the uterus.
