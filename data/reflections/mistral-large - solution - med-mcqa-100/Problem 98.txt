Solution:
Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the pylorus, the opening between the stomach and the small intestine, becomes narrowed or blocked.
The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is a "single bubble appearance," which is caused by the dilated stomach and the absence of gas in the distal small bowel.
