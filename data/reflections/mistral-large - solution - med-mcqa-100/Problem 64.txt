Solution:
[REDACTED]s are the most common type of ovarian tumor and are often found in women of reproductive age.
[REDACTED]s are typically small and mobile, and have a long pedicle, making them more prone to torsion.
During pregnancy, the enlarging uterus can cause the ovary to become displaced, increasing the risk of torsion.
[REDACTED]s are also more likely to undergo torsion during pregnancy because they are often not diagnosed until they cause symptoms, such as pain or discomfort.
