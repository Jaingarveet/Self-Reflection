Solution:
Spring catarrh is a seasonal allergic re[REDACTED]tion char[REDACTED]terized [REDACTED]y symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. It is caused [REDACTED]y an overre[REDACTED]tion of the immune system to environmental allergens such as pollen.

The four types of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions are:

* Type I: immediate hypersensitivity, mediated [REDACTED]y IgE anti[REDACTED]odies and mast cells/[REDACTED]asophils (e.g., anaphylaxis, allergic rhinitis)
* Type II: cytotoxic hypersensitivity, mediated [REDACTED]y IgG or IgM anti[REDACTED]odies and complement (e.g., hemolytic anemia, Goodpasture's disease)
* Type III: immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity, mediated [REDACTED]y antigen-anti[REDACTED]ody complexes and complement (e.g., serum sickness, Arthus re[REDACTED]tion)
* Type IV: delayed-type hypersensitivity, mediated [REDACTED]y T cells (e.g., cont[REDACTED]t dermatitis, tu[REDACTED]erculin re[REDACTED]tion)

Spring catarrh is a type I hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion, [REDACTED]ut it can also [REDACTED]e associated with type IV hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.
