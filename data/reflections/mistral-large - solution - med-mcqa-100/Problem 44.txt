Solution:
The Bishop score is a method used to assess the likelihood of successful induction of labor.
It is based on several factors, including cervical dilation, effacement, station, consistency, and position, as well as fetal station and the presence or absence of cervical dilation.
In this case, the patient has a cervical dilation of 3 cm, which is worth 3 points.
The cervix is slightly soft, which is worth 1 point.
The cervix is located anteriorly, which is worth 2 points.
The fetal head is at -1 station, which is worth 1 point.
The length of the cervix is < 0.5 cm, which is worth 3 points.
Adding up these points, the patient's Bishop score is 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = [REDACTED].
However, the maximum score for any one factor is 3, so the score for cervical dilation should be 3, not 4.
Therefore, the correct Bishop score is 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = [REDACTED] - 1 = [REDACTED].
