Solution:
The average growth rate for children between the ages of 2 and 5 is about 6 cm per year.
To find the average gain in length over 4 years, we need to multiply the growth rate per year by the number of years.
6 cm/year \* 4 years = 24 cm
However, the question asks for the answer in centimeters, not in years.
Therefore, we do not need to divide by the number of years.
The correct answer is 24 cm.
