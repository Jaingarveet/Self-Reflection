Solution:
The patient underwent lateral skull base surgery and has presented with recurrent aspirations.
The patient has no change in voice.
The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is responsible for the motor function of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx, and it also provides sensory information from these areas. Injury to the vagus nerve can cause dysphagia and aspiration.
The glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) is responsible for the sensation of the posterior third of the tongue, the pharynx, and the middle ear, and it also controls the stylopharyngeus muscle, which helps elevate the larynx during swallowing. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can cause dysphagia, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.
The [REDACTED] (superior laryngeal nerve) is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides sensory information from the larynx and motor function to the cricothyroid muscle, which helps control the pitch of the voice. Injury to the [REDACTED] can cause hoarseness or a change in voice, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.
The [REDACTED] (recurrent laryngeal nerve) is a branch of the vagus nerve that provides motor function to all the muscles of the larynx except the cricothyroid muscle. Injury to the [REDACTED] can cause hoarseness or a change in voice, but it is less likely to cause aspiration.
Since the patient has no change in voice, it is unlikely that the SLN or [REDACTED] is injured.
The most likely nerve to be injured during surgery is the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN), which can cause aspiration without a change in voice.
