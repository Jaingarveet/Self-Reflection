Solution:
The ideal buffer system should have a high concentration in the solution it is buffering.
In the case of blood, the bicarbonate buffer system is ideal because it has a high concentration in the blood.
The bicarbonate buffer system is effective in blood because of its high concentration, which allows it to maintain the pH balance.
