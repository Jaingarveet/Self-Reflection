## Explanation:
My initial calculation was incorrect. I multiplied the map distance (20 inches) by the scale (10 miles/inch) but forgot to divide by 4, which represents the 1/4 inch increment on the map. This resulted in an overestimation of the actual distance.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of scale
* Multiplication error
* Division error
* Unit conversion error
## Solution:
1. Identify the map distance: 20 inches
2. Identify the scale: 1/4 inch represents 10 miles
3. Convert the map distance to miles: 20 inches * (10 miles / 1/4 inch) = 800 miles
4. Simplify the expression: 800 miles
