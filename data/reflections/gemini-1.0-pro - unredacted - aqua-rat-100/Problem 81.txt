## Explanation:
My initial approach was correct in identifying the need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 8 to fulfill the minimum daily requirement for both vitamins. However, I made a critical error in interpreting the LCM value.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of LCM
* Incorrect calculation of individual vitamin intake
* Failure to consider minimum requirement fulfillment
## Solution:
1. **Calculate the LCM of 9 and 8:** The LCM is indeed 72.
2. **Misinterpretation:** I mistakenly assumed that consuming 72% of the daily requirement for each vitamin would be sufficient. However, the question explicitly asks for the minimum daily requirement, which is 100%.
3. **Correct Calculation:** To fulfill 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin E, we need 72/9 = 8 grams.
4. **Correct Calculation:** Similarly, for vitamin A, we need 72/8 = 9 grams.
5. **Combined Intake:** Therefore, the total daily intake required is 8 + 9 = 17 grams.
## Instructions:
1. Identify the percentage of daily requirement provided by one gram of the health food for each vitamin.
2. Calculate the LCM of the percentages.
3. **Crucially:** Remember that the goal is to fulfill 100% of the daily requirement, not just the LCM value.
4. Calculate the individual intake required for each vitamin based on 100% fulfillment.
5. Add the individual intake amounts to find the total daily intake required.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated total intake.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to the wording of the question and ensure you understand the exact requirement.
* Double-check your calculations at each step to avoid errors.
* Be mindful of units and ensure consistency throughout your calculations.
* Consider alternative approaches and double-check your reasoning to avoid misinterpretations.
* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and identify potential pitfalls.
