## Explanation:
My initial thought process was correct in calculating the profit per bag ($25). However, I made a mistake when dividing the total profit ($3,000) by the profit per bag ($25). Instead of correctly calculating 3,000 / 25 = 120, I mistakenly calculated 3,000 / 25 = 12. This resulted in an incorrect answer of 12 bags sold.
## Error Keywords:
* Division error
* Calculation error
* Misinterpretation of result
## Solution:
1. Calculate the profit per bag: 25% of $100 = $25.
2. Divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $3,000 / $25 = 120.
3. Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.
## Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information: profit percentage, selling price, and total profit.
2. Calculate the profit per unit (e.g., per bag) based on the given percentage and selling price.
3. Divide the total profit by the profit per unit to find the number of units sold.
4. Double-check your calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that corresponds to your calculated result.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.
* Double-check your calculations, especially when dealing with division.
* Consider using a calculator to minimize calculation errors.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
* Read the question carefully and ensure you understand what is being asked.
