Explanation:
My initial approach was correct in finding the range of both the numerator and denominator. However, I made a mistake in simplifying the final range of x. I incorrectly rounded the lower bound to 20 instead of 28.
Error Keywords:
 - Rounding error
 - Approximation error
 - Range calculation error
Solution:
1. Find the range of n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16.
2. Find the range of n + 4√n + 4.
3. Divide the range of the numerator by the range of the denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting range.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated range.
Instructions:
1. When finding the range of an expression, consider all possible values of the variable within the given constraints.
2. Be careful when simplifying expressions, especially when dealing with inequalities.
3. Double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy.
4. Pay attention to rounding errors and ensure they do not significantly impact the final result.
Advice:
 - When solving problems involving inequalities, it's often helpful to visualize the ranges of the expressions involved.
 - Consider using graphical representations or tables to aid in understanding the relationships between variables.
 - Be mindful of the potential for rounding errors and their impact on the final answer.
 - Always strive for precision in your calculations and reasoning.
