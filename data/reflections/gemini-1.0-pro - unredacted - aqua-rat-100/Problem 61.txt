Explanation:
My initial approach was correct, but I made a mistake in solving the equation. I incorrectly assumed that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was halfway between A and B. This led me to the wrong answer.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
Let's denote the distance between A and B as x.
The time it took Kevin to travel from A to B is x/70 hours.
The time it took Kevin to travel from B to A is x/90 hours.
The total time of the trip is x/70 + x/90 = 6 hours.
Three hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B, which means he had already traveled x - 70 miles.
Therefore, the time it took him to travel x - 70 miles is (x - 70)/70 hours.
We know that this time is 3 hours less than the total time of the trip, which is 6 - 3 = 3 hours.
So, (x - 70)/70 = 3
x - 70 = 210
x = 280 miles
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
2. Define variables to represent the unknowns.
3. Set up equations based on the given information and the relationships between the variables.
4. Solve the equations step-by-step.
5. Be mindful of units and conversions.
