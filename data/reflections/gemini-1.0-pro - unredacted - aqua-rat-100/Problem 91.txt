Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the north and south movements would cancel each other out, resulting in a net movement of 5km east. However, the problem states that A travels 3km north, which means they end up 3km north of their starting point. Therefore, the north and south movements do not cancel each other out, and A is actually 3km north of their starting point.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of problem statement
- Incorrect assumption
- Failure to account for all movements
Solution:
1. Identify the starting point of A.
2. Identify the direction and distance of each movement.
3. Calculate the net movement in each direction (north-south and east-west).
4. Use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the total distance from the starting point.
```
Net movement north: 3km north - 3km south = 0km
Net movement east: 5km east - 2km west = 3km
Total distance: sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) = 3km
```
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem statement and identify all relevant information.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Calculate the net movement in each direction separately.
4. Use the appropriate formula (e.g., Pythagorean theorem) to calculate the total distance.
5. Double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting an answer.
General Advice:
- Pay close attention to the wording of the problem statement.
- Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated.
- Consider all possible movements and their impact on the final position.
- Use appropriate formulas and calculations to determine the final distance.
- Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
