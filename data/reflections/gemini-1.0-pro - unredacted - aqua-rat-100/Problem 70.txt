## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach to the problem was flawed. I focused solely on the arrival times of the trains, neglecting the crucial aspect of their frequencies. This led me to calculate the probability based on a single instance instead of considering the long-term pattern.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the problem by focusing on a single instance instead of the overall frequency.
* **Incomplete analysis:** I failed to consider the frequency of both trains, leading to an inaccurate probability calculation.
* **Logical error:** I made a logical error by assuming that the first train to arrive would always be the main line train.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the frequencies:** Both trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, meaning they arrive every 10 minutes.
2. **Calculate the probability of each train arriving first:**
    * Main line train: Probability = (Time interval for harbor line train to arrive) / (Combined time interval for both trains) = 2 minutes / 10 minutes = 0.2
    * Harbor line train: Probability = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8
3. **Choose the answer that reflects the higher probability:** The man is more likely to catch the harbor line train first, with a probability of 0.8.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. **Read the problem carefully:** Pay close attention to all details, including frequencies and time intervals.
2. **Consider long-term patterns:** Don't focus on single instances; analyze the overall pattern of events.
3. **Apply correct logic:** Ensure your reasoning aligns with the problem's context and avoids assumptions.
4. **Double-check calculations:** Verify your calculations to avoid errors.
**General Advice:**
* **Break down complex problems:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Visualize the problem:** Use diagrams or tables to represent the information.
* **Test your assumptions:** Verify your initial assumptions against the problem's details.
* **Seek alternative solutions:** Explore different approaches to solve the problem.
* **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze your errors and identify areas for improvement.
By following these steps and advice, I can improve my problem-solving skills and avoid similar mistakes in the future.
