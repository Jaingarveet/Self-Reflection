## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach involved calculating the total work hours (245) and setting up an equation based on the individual work rates and total toys made. However, I made a crucial error in assuming that Alex and Jacob worked for "almost similar" hours. This assumption led me to solve for the total hours worked by Jacob (165) and then calculate the number of toys he made (18).
**Error Keywords:**
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the meaning of "almost similar" hours, leading to an inaccurate assumption.
* **Incorrect equation:** The equation I set up was based on the assumption of equal work hours, which was not the case.
* **Calculation error:** The final calculation of Jacob's toys was based on the incorrect work hours.
## Solution with Correct Approach
**Step 1:** Define variables:
* Let `a` be the number of toys Alex made.
* Let `j` be the number of toys Jacob made.
**Step 2:** Set up equations based on work rates and total toys:
* `a + j = 35` (total toys)
* `7a + 9j = 245` (total work hours)
**Step 3:** Solve the system of equations:
We can solve for `a` in the first equation: `a = 35 - j`. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
`7(35 - j) + 9j = 245`
Simplifying and solving for `j`, we get:
`j = 15`
**Step 4:** Calculate the number of toys Jacob made:
`j = 15`
