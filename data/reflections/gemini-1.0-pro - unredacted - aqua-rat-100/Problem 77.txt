Solution:
The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square.
We need to find a two-digit odd number that is part of a set of 5 consecutive odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.
Let's start with option C: 41.
41 is an odd number.
The next four consecutive odd numbers are 43, 45, 47, and 49.
The sum of these five numbers is 225.
225 divided by 10 is 22.5, which is not a perfect square.
Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.
We can repeat this process for the remaining options.
Only option D, 67, satisfies the condition.
The sum of the five consecutive odd numbers starting from 67 is 335.
335 divided by 10 is 33.5, which is a perfect square (the square root of 33.5 is 5.78).
Therefore, the correct answer is D: 67.
Instructions:
1. Identify the set of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers.
2. Calculate the sum of these numbers.
3. Divide the sum by 10.
4. Check if the result is a perfect square.
5. If the result is a perfect square, the corresponding starting number is the correct answer.
6. If the result is not a perfect square, repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining options.
Advice:
 - Always read the instructions carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that a perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer.
 - Remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: sum = (n/2)*(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term.
