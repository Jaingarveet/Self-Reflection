Explanation:
I made a mistake in interpreting the problem statement. I assumed that the cost of each white sharpener was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener, but the problem statement actually says that the cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener. This led me to an incorrect equation and an impossible solution.

- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect assumption
- Logical error
Solution:
Let the cost of each brown sharpener be x rupees.
Then the cost of each white sharpener is (x + 1) rupees.
The total cost of the white sharpeners is x * (x + 1).
The total cost of the brown sharpeners is (18 - x) * x.
The total cost of the sharpeners is rs. 100.
So, x * (x + 1) + (18 - x) * x = 100.
Simplifying the equation, we get x^2 + 18x - 100 = 0.
Factoring the equation, we get (x - 5)(x + 20) = 0.
Solving for x, we get x = 5 or x = -20.
Since the cost of a sharpener cannot be negative, we discard the solution x = -20.
Therefore, the cost of each brown sharpener is rs. 5.
The cost of each white sharpener is rs. 6.
The number of white sharpeners is 100 / 6 = 16.66, which we round down to 10.
The number of brown sharpeners is 18 - 10 = 8.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem statement carefully and identify the given information.
2. Define variables to represent the unknowns.
3. Write down the equations that relate the variables to the given information.
4. Solve the equations to find the values of the variables.
5. Check your solution to make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
Advice:
- Be careful not to make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem statement.
- Check your work carefully to avoid making careless mistakes.
- If you get stuck, try to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.
