## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach focused on individual seating arrangements rather than relative positions. I correctly identified the fixed position of Susan on the left but failed to consider the constraint of Tim being on her right. This led to an overestimation of the possible arrangements.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Logic error:** Misunderstanding the problem's constraints and applying an incorrect solution strategy.
* **Permutation error:** Failing to account for the specific order requirement of Tim being to the right of Susan.
## Solution with Correct Approach
1. **Identify fixed positions:** Susan must be on the leftmost chair.
2. **Constrained arrangement:** Tim must occupy the chair to the right of Susan, leaving only one possible position for him.
3. **Remaining chair:** The last chair can be occupied by the remaining child (Zen) in one way.
4. **Total arrangements:** 1 (Susan) * 1 (Tim) * 1 (Zen) = 1 arrangement.
## Instructions for Future Success
1. **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to all problem constraints and requirements.
2. **Visualize:** Sketch or imagine the arrangement to better understand the problem.
3. **Consider relative positions:** Account for the order and relationships between objects.
4. **Double-check logic:** Ensure your solution aligns with the problem's conditions.
5. **Test with examples:** Try different scenarios to verify your approach.
