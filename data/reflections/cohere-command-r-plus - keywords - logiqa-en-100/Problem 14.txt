Solution: Given:
- [REDACTED] six-story office building housing six departments: Finance (F), Planning (P), Administration (A), Sales (S), Human Resources (HR), and Research & Development (R&D).
- Known information: 
    1. HR and Sales are not adjacent.
    2. Finance is one floor above Planning.
    3. Administration is above Planning but below HR.

Task: Determine which statement must be true if HR is not above Administration. 

Step-by-step solution:
1. From Known 2 and 3, we can place Finance and Planning on consecutive floors, but their absolute floor numbers are unknown.
2. Administration must be above Planning (Known 3) but with at least one floor separating them (due to Finance being in between).
3. Human Resources cannot be above Administration (given constraint).
4. Sales cannot be adjacent to HR (Known 1), so it must be at least two floors away from HR.
5. R&[REDACTED] must occupy one of the remaining floors. 

Now, consider the options:
[REDACTED]. Sales above R&[REDACTED]: Possible, but this doesn't account for the relative positions of Administration and HR.
[REDACTED]. Sales one floor above Administration: This satisfies the condition that Sales isn't adjacent to HR and also places Administration above Planning with at least one floor between them.
[REDACTED]. Sales above Planning: This would mean Administration is above Planning with no floors in between, contradicting Known 3.
[REDACTED]. Sales on the second floor: This doesn't guarantee the relative positions of Administration and HR.

The correct answer is [REDACTED].
