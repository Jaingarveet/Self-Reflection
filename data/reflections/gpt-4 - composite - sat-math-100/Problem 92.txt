Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made a mistake in the algebraic manipulation of the formula. I didn't correctly apply the rule of reciprocals when dividing by a fraction.
Error Keywords:
- Algebraic manipulation error
- Division by fraction error
- Reciprocal rule error
Solution:
Given the formula $$m=\frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} P$$
To isolate P, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the fraction on the right side of the equation. This gives us:
$$P=\frac{m}{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}} \times \left[\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1\right]$$
Simplifying this gives us:
$[REDACTED]$
So, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the variable you need to isolate (in this case, P).
2. Divide both sides of the equation by the fraction on the right side of the equation.
3. Apply the rule of reciprocals when dividing by a fraction.
4. Simplify the equation to get the formula for P in terms of m, r, and N.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Be careful with algebraic manipulations, especially when dealing with fractions.
- Remember the rule of reciprocals when dividing by a fraction: dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
