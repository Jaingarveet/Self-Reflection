Explanation:
I made a mistake in the process of solving the system of equations. I incorrectly multiplied the second equation by 3 and the first equation by 2. This led to an incorrect calculation of the x-coordinate.
Error Keywords:
- System of equations
- Calculation error
- Multiplication error
- Substitution error
Solution:
To solve the system of equations, we can use the method of elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 0.5 and the second equation by 1.5 to make the coefficients of y the same:
1.2x - 0.75y = 0.15
2.4x + 0.75y = -1.95
Adding these two equations together, we get:
3.6x = -1.8
Solving for x, we find:
x = -1.8 / 3.6 = [REDACTED]
Instructions:
1. Identify the system of equations.
2. Multiply the equations to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same.
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one of the variables.
4. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember to correctly multiply the equations to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same.
