Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. This means that T cannot be performed third, as it would not be immediately before F or immediately after R. 
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking conditions
- Logical reasoning error
- Order arrangement error
Solution:
Given that S is performed fourth, and P is performed at some time before S, P must be performed in one of the first three positions. Also, O is performed either first or fifth. Since S is fourth, O must be performed first. Therefore, the first composition must be O, and P must be either second or third. However, considering the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, T cannot be performed third. Therefore, the only option that fits these conditions is "C: O, P, R".
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the fixed positions of the compositions based on the conditions.
3. Consider all conditions while arranging the compositions.
4. Eliminate options that do not meet the conditions.
5. Choose the option that fits all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
- Break down the problem and consider each condition separately.
- Be careful not to overlook any conditions.
- Use logical reasoning to solve the problem.
- Double-check your answer to ensure it meets all conditions.
