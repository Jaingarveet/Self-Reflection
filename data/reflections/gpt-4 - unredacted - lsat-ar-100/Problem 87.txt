Explanation:
I misunderstood the requirement that "at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected." I interpreted this as needing to select at least one French novel, but it actually means that the number of French novels selected must be equal to or greater than the number of Russian novels selected.

Solution:
Given the requirements, the organizer must select at least three but no more than four novels. Also, at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. This means that at least two French novels must be selected to meet the minimum requirement of three novels and to ensure that the number of French novels selected is equal to or greater than the number of Russian novels selected. Therefore, the correct answer is D: two French novels.
