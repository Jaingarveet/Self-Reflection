Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the third condition. I thought that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies had to be made on the same day, but the condition actually states that they are made on the same day. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option A and choose option B.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Condition misunderstanding
- Incorrect elimination
Solution:
Revisiting the conditions and the options:
1. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
2. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
3. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
4. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Option A: oatmeal: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday peanut butter: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday sugar: Monday, Thursday, Friday
- This option satisfies all conditions. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Interpret each condition correctly.
3. Analyze each option against the conditions.
4. Eliminate options that violate any of the conditions.
5. Choose the option that satisfies all conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them correctly.
- Be careful with the interpretation of conditions.
- Analyze each option against the conditions, not against each other.
- Always double-check your understanding of the conditions and your analysis of the options.
