Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions given in the question. I incorrectly assumed that Solide's website target must be 1 day, which led me to exclude it as a possible answer. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition analysis error
Solution:
Given the conditions, Image's voicemail target must be the shortest, so it must be 1 day. This means that Image's website target can be either 1 or 2 days. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so if Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target can be 1 or 2 days. This means that Truvest's website target can be either 2 or 3 days. Truvest's voicemail target can be either 2 or 3 days, but it must be shorter than its website target, so it can only be 2 days if the website target is 3 days. Therefore, Solide's website target could be 2 days.
