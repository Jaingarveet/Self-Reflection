Explanation:
I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that Irving could give a report on Wednesday, but the conditions state that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Helen is giving a morning report, Nina cannot give a report because there is no next day for both Helen and Irving to give reports. This means Irving must give his report on Monday.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Condition application error
Solution:
Given that Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, we can deduce the following:
- Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they must give their reports in the morning. But since the morning slots are already taken by Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports.
- George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must take one of the afternoon slots.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. But since Helen is giving a morning report, Nina cannot give a report because there is no next day for both Helen and Irving to give reports.
- This leaves Irving as the only one who can give the afternoon report on Monday.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the constraints for each student.
3. Apply the constraints to the given scenario.
4. Use logical reasoning to deduce the possible scenarios.
5. Identify the scenario that must be true based on the conditions and constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the constraints and conditions before attempting to solve the problem.
- Use logical reasoning to deduce the possible scenarios.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and constraints.
- Practice more problems to improve your logical reasoning skills.
