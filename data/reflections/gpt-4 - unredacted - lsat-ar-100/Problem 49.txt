Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the second constraint. I thought that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, but the constraint actually means that there must be at least two other businesses between the two restaurants. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Logical reasoning
Solution:
Re-evaluating the choices with the correct understanding of the constraints:
E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
- This satisfies all constraints. The pharmacy is at one end and a restaurant is at the other. The two restaurants are separated by two businesses. The pharmacy is next to the optometrist. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and constraints carefully.
2. Understand the meaning of each constraint.
3. Evaluate each choice against the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that satisfies all constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Make sure you understand the meaning of each constraint.
- Evaluate each choice systematically.
- Don't rush, take your time to understand the problem.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
