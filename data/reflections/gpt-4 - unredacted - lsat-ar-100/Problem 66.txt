Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I focused on the condition that if R is seventh, then G must be sixth and J must be fifth or earlier, which led me to choose the wrong answer. However, the correct answer is C: R is fourth. This is because if R is fourth, then G and J must be in the first three positions, and since S must be earlier than Y, and Q can only be third if S is earlier, this fully determines the order of the articles.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Order and sequence error
Solution:
Given the conditions, if R is fourth, then G and J must be in the first three positions. This is because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Also, since S must be earlier than Y, and Q can only be third if S is earlier, this fully determines the order of the articles. Therefore, the correct answer is C: R is fourth.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the problem.
2. Analyze each option and see how it affects the order of the articles.
3. Remember that the order is fully determined if there is only one possible sequence of articles.
4. Choose the option that allows only one possible sequence of articles.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Break down complex problems into simpler parts.
- Analyze each option individually.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
- Don't rush, take your time to understand the problem.
