Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that Rottweilers were featured on day 1, but the conditions only stated that Greyhounds were featured on day 1. This led me to incorrectly eliminate option D.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of conditions
- Assumption error
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and not on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. 
Option D states that Rottweilers are featured only on day 3. This could be true because it does not violate any of the conditions. Rottweilers are not featured on day 1, day 7, or any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and conditions carefully.
2. Understand the restrictions for each breed.
3. Evaluate each option against the conditions.
4. Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
5. Choose the option that could be true without violating any conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Do not make assumptions that are not supported by the conditions.
- Evaluate each option individually.
- Remember that the question asks for a possibility, not a certainty.
