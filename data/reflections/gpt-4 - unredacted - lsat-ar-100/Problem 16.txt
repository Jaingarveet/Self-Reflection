Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the constraint that "Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's." I thought it meant that Julio must be scheduled before Olivia on the same day, not that Julio's session must be on a day before Olivia's session in the week.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Constraint misunderstanding
- Scheduling error
Solution:
Re-evaluating the choices with the correct understanding of the constraints:
E: Wednesday: Julio, Lan Thursday: Olivia, Nessa Friday: Rebecca, Kevin
- Kevin and Rebecca are on the same day (Friday), Lan and Olivia are not on the same day, Nessa is in the afternoon (Thursday), and Julio's session (Wednesday) is on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's (Thursday). This choice meets all the constraints.
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints of the problem.
2. Interpret the constraints correctly.
3. Evaluate each choice against the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that meets all the constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Make sure you understand the constraints correctly.
- Evaluate each choice systematically.
- Double-check your understanding of the constraints and your evaluation of the choices.
