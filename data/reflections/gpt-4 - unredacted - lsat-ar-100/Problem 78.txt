Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. I interpreted this as Helen and Irving must give their reports on the same day, which is not necessarily true. They just need to give their reports after Nina, not necessarily on the same day.

- Condition misunderstanding
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only give a report on Tuesday, this means that Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to give reports the next day, Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Monday and Robert on Wednesday. This means that Helen can give a report on Wednesday because she can give her report the day after Nina. So, the correct answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Identify the constraints for each student.
3. Determine the possible days each student can give their reports.
4. Consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
5. Understand that Helen and Irving do not necessarily have to give their reports on the same day, just after Nina.
6. Choose the answer that fits all the conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and conditions carefully.
- Understand the constraints and conditions for each individual.
- Break down the problem and consider each condition separately.
- Be careful with the interpretation of conditions.
- Always double-check your answer against all conditions.
