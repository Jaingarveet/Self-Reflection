Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the conditions. I assumed that George must give the morning report on Tuesday because Kyle was giving the afternoon report. However, the conditions only state that George can only give a report on Tuesday, not that he must. This led me to eliminate all options that didn't have George reporting on Tuesday, which was a mistake.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Assumption error
- Condition misunderstanding
Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that:
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, George can't give a report because all afternoon slots are taken and he can only report on Tuesday. This means that the morning report on Tuesday must be given by someone other than George. The only option that fits these conditions is D: Robert, George, and Irving.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions given in the question.
2. Do not make assumptions that are not stated in the conditions.
3. Identify the constraints for each day.
4. Eliminate options that do not meet the constraints.
5. Choose the option that fits all the conditions and constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the conditions carefully and understand them fully.
- Do not make assumptions that are not stated in the conditions.
- Work systematically, eliminating options that do not meet the conditions.
- Double-check your understanding of the conditions and your application of them to the options.
