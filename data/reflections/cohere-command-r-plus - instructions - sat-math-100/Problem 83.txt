Instructions:
1. Understand the goal: To estimate the proportion of satisfied employees across all 50 stores.
2. Recognize the need for representation: Each store should be represented to ensure an unbiased estimate. 
3. Identify the method: Select a random sample of employees from each store. 
4. Justify the choice: This method ensures that every store has an equal chance of representation, providing a more accurate estimate. 
5. Avoid biased methods: 
   - Surveying a single store overlooks the potential variation across stores. 
   - Surveying only high/low-paid employees introduces a salary bias. 
   - Voluntary responses on a website may skew results toward very satisfied/dissatisfied employees.
