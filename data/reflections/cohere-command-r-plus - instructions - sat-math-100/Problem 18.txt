Instructions:
1. Identify the expression you need to simplify: $9^{3/4}$. 
2. Recognize that you can rewrite $9^{3/4}$ as $9^{1/4} * 9^{1/2}$. 
3. Simplify $9^{1/4}$ to [REDACTED] and $9^{1/2}$ to $\sqrt{9}$. 
4. Calculate $\sqrt[4]{9} = 3$ and $\sqrt{9} = 3^{1/2} = 3\sqrt{3}$. 
5. Multiply $3$ and $3\sqrt{3}$ to get $3\sqrt{3}$.
