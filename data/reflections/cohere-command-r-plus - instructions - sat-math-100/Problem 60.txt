Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: Mr. Kohl has a fixed amount of solution, and there are two scenarios with different distributions. 
2. Identify the variables: $n$ (amount of solution), $x$ (number of students). 
3. Write the equations: $3x + 5 = n$ and $4x + 5 = n + [REDACTED]$. 
4. Solve for $n$ in the first equation: $n = 3x + 5$. 
5. Substitute and solve: Replace $n$ in the second equation and solve for $x$. 
6. Double-check: Plug $x$ back into both equations to ensure they are satisfied. 
7. Answer: Choose the option that matches the calculated value of $x$.
