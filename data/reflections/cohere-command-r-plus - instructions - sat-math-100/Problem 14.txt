Instructions:

1. Examine the table and identify the pattern: as x increases by 3a, y decreases by 1a. 
2. Recognize this as a linear relationship with a negative slope. 
3. Find the y-intercept by identifying the value of y when x=a. 
4. Express the relationship as an equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
5. Rearrange the equation to make x the subject, and then multiply by the appropriate value of a to match the options.
