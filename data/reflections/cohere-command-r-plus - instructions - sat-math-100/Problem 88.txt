Instructions:
1. Understand the context: a ball is launched vertically upward with an initial velocity, and we want to find when it hits the ground. 
2. Set $h=0$ to find when the height is zero (ground level). 
3. Use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$, being careful with the signs and square root calculations. 
4. Interpret the solutions: the positive value represents the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground. 
5. Compare the approximate value to the given answer choices and select the best match.
