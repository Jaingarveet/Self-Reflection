Instructions:

1. Understand the question: Identify the given information ($p(3) = -2$) and the task (determine the factor or remainder). 
2. Recognize the concept: Identify this problem as one that involves the remainder theorem. 
3. Apply the theorem: Use the remainder theorem, which states that the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$ is equal to $p(c)$. 
4. Plug in the value: Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $p(x)$ to find $p(3)$. 
5. Interpret the result: Recognize that $p(3) = -2$ is the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. 
6. Choose the correct answer: Select the answer choice that matches this conclusion.
