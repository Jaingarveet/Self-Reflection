Instructions:

1. Identify the given equations: $a^2 + b^2 = z$ and $ab = y$.
2. Understand the task: Find the expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$.
3. Substitute $z$ and $y$ directly into the choices without expanding the squared terms.
4. Simplify each choice to match the form $4z + 8y$, $4z + 4y$, $16z + 16y$, etc.
5. Choose the answer that matches the simplified expression.
