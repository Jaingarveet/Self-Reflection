Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and the variable to be determined ($p$).
2. Define variables: Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.
3. Calculate the original area: The area of the rectangle is $LW$.
4. Calculate the altered area: After changing the length and width, the new area is $(1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.
5. Set up the equation: The altered area is [REDACTED]% less than the original area, so set up the equation $0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$.
6. Simplify the equation: Simplify the equation to isolate $p$.
7. Solve for $p$: Calculate the value of $p$ by isolating it in the equation.
8. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches the calculated value of $p$.
