Instructions:
1. Understand the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is weight, $m$ is mass, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity. 
2. Calculate the mass of the object using the weight on Earth and Earth's acceleration due to gravity. 
3. For each planet, multiply the calculated mass by the respective acceleration due to gravity to find the weight. 
4. Compare the calculated weights to the desired weight of $170$ newtons. 
5. Choose the planet that provides the closest approximation.
