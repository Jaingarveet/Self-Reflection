Instructions:
1. Understand the concept of slope and the point-slope formula.
2. Identify the given information: the point $(0, 0)$ and the slope $m = \frac{1}{7}$.
3. Use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.
4. Plug in the values of $m$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ into the formula to get $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
5. Test each choice by plugging the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
6. Choose the answer where the equation holds true. 
7. Remember that a line in the plane is defined by its equation, not by a single point.
