Instructions:
1. Understand that a linear function forms a straight line when graphed.
2. Recognize that a single point may not uniquely define a linear function.
3. Calculate the slope of the line using any two distinct points from the table.
4. Determine the y-intercept by evaluating $f(0)$.
5. Use the calculated slope and y-intercept to write the equation in slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$.
6. Compare the calculated equation with the provided options to find the correct match.
