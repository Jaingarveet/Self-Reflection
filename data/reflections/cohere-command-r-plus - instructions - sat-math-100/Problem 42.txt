Instructions:
1. Expand the left side of the equation and compare coefficients with the right side.
2. Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the given equation $a + b = 8$.
3. Plug the value of $b$ into the equation $ab = 15$ to find $a$.
4. Calculate the value of $c$ using the equation $7a = c$.
5. Find the two values of $c$ that satisfy the equation when $a$ and $b$ are varied.
6. Ensure your values of $c$ satisfy the original equation.
7. Choose the answer option that matches these values of $c$.
