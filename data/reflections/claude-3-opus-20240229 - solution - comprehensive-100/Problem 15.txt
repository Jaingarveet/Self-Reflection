Solution:
1. The expert opinion is that the decline in the Xinjiang northern salamander population is primarily due to trampling by cattle and sheep in their grassland habitat.
2. To raise doubts about this opinion, we should look for a choice that provides a compelling alternative explanation for the population decline.
3. Choice [REDACTED] about increased protection efforts doesn't challenge the core opinion.
4. Choice [REDACTED] states that decreased rainfall and lower groundwater levels have affected the salamanders' water source environment. This introduces a separate environmental factor that could significantly impact the population, apart from the trampling issue.
5. While Choice [REDACTED] suggests the salamanders may avoid some trampling by hiding during the day, it doesn't offer an alternative cause for the overall decline.
6. Choice [REDACTED] about tourist access is not directly relevant to the population decline.
Therefore, Choice [REDACTED] raises the most doubts by proposing a distinct, plausible environmental cause (water issues) challenging the completeness of the expert opinion focused on trampling.
