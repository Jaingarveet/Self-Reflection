Solution:
The argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View, which is why their commute times will increase after the company moves there. For this to be true, the argument must assume that the employees' pay will not increase enough to make housing near Ocean View affordable. If Acme provided a significant pay raise along with the move, employees might be able to afford closer housing, and the conclusion about increased commute times would not necessarily follow.
[REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED]: While these statements might be true, they are not required for the argument's conclusion to hold.
[REDACTED]: This is the necessary assumption. Without assuming that there will be no significant pay raise, it's possible that employees could afford housing near Ocean View, invalidating the argument's conclusion.
