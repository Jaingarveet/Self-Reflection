Solution:
1. Find the speed of the space shuttle:
   * In 40 seconds, it travels 700m high.
   * Speed = Distance / Time
   * Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
2. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds:
   * Distance = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s = 87.5 m
3. The length of the shuttle is the distance it travels in the time it takes to pass a point.
   * Length of shuttle = Distance traveled in 5 seconds / Time taken to pass a point
   * Length of shuttle = 87.5 m / 5 s = 17.5 m
4. Multiply by 5 to convert to the correct units:
   * Length of shuttle = 17.5 m × 5 = 87.5 m
Therefore, the correct length of the space shuttle is 87.5 meters, which rounds up to [REDACTED]eters (Choice C).
