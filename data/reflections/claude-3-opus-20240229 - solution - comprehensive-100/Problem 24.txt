Solution:
1. Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, leaving George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
2. George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give the Tuesday morning report.
3. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports if they give reports at all.
4. If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But George must give the Tuesday morning report, so Irving would have to give the Tuesday afternoon report.
5. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible.
6. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday. If she gives a report, it must be on Wednesday morning.
7. The only possible arrangement for the morning reports is:
   - Monday: Olivia
   - Tuesday: George
   - Wednesday: Irving
