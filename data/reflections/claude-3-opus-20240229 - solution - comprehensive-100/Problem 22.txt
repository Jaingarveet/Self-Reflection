Solution:
1. George must give his report on Tuesday, as that is the only day he can do so.
2. Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so he must give his report on either Monday morning or Wednesday morning.
3. If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. This is possible because George's report could be in the morning and Helen and Irving's reports could be in the afternoon.
4. If Nina gives her report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports, as George is already giving his report on Tuesday.
5. If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports, as the condition only applies if Nina's report is not on Wednesday.
6. Therefore, Nina could give her report on either Monday or Wednesday.
7. If Nina gives her report on Monday and Robert gives his on Wednesday, then Helen could give her report on Wednesday as well. This matches answer choice [REDACTED].
