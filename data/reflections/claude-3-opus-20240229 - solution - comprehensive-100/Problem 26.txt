Solution:
Given:
 - The shoe store is in space 2.
 - The pharmacy must be at one end (space 1 or 7) and a restaurant at the other end.
 - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
 - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
 - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Consider each choice:
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]
   Arrangement: Restaurant - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Optometrist - (any) - Pharmacy
   This satisfies all constraints, so this could be true.
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]
   This violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian, as the shoe store is in space 2. So this cannot be true.
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED] restaurant is in space 3.
   Arrangement: Pharmacy - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Optometrist - Veterinarian - Restaurant
   This satisfies all constraints, so this could be true. My original analysis was incorrect.
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]
   This violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, as the veterinarian would need to be in space 5 or 7 in this case. So this cannot be true.
[REDACTED]. [REDACTED]
   This violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian, as spaces 1 and 7 are too far from space 4. So this cannot be true.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. The optometrist could be in space 5.
