Solution:
1. Robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls. This could mean:
   a) It recognizes color (red) but not shape, so it is type [REDACTED]. 
   b) It does not recognize shape (square vs ball), so it is not type [REDACTED].
2. Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls. This could mean:  
   a) It recognizes shape (ball) but not color, so it is type [REDACTED].
   b) It does not recognize color (red vs blue), so it is not type [REDACTED].
3. The only choice that matches both of these possibilities is [REDACTED]: No.1 is not Type [REDACTED] and No.2 is not Type [REDACTED].
