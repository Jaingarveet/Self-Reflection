Solution:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) For x pickets, there are only x-1 spaces. 
5) The total length in inches is: 
   (number of pickets * width of each picket) + (number of spaces * width of each space)
   = (x * 1/2) + ((x-1) * 6)
   = x/2 + 6x - 6
   = [REDACTED] - 6 inches
6) To convert inches to feet, divide by 12:
   ([REDACTED] - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
