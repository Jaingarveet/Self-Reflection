Solution:
The professor's argument can be broken down as follows:
Premise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.
Premise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.
Premise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.
Conclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw the conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the premises (Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons despite no cost and potential customer satisfaction) to the conclusion (Checkers's motive was to hurt Marty's).
Choice [REDACTED] provides this necessary assumption: If a company refuses to accept a competitor's coupons when doing so would satisfy potential customers and cost nothing, then the company's sole motivation must be to hurt the competitor. This assumption bridges the gap between the premises and the conclusion, enabling the conclusion to be properly drawn.
