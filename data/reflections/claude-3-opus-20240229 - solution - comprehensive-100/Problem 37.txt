Solution:
The passage states: "which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer." 
This directly implies that cats produce different allergy-causing proteins.
If all cats produced the exact same proteins, the proteins causing an individual's allergies would not vary.
Therefore, not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins in their skin secretions and saliva.
While the passage also supports that no cat causes allergies in everyone, this implication about protein variability in cats is more direct.
