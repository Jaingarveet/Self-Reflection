Solution:
Given:
- 8 books total: F, G, [REDACTED], K, L, M, O
- 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
- At least 2 books per shelf
- More books on bottom than top
- I on middle shelf
- K on higher shelf than F
- O on higher shelf than L
- F on same shelf as M
- G on top shelf
If G is on the top shelf:
1. I must be on the middle shelf.
2. K must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as K is higher than F).
3. O must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as O is higher than L).
4. F and M must be together on the bottom shelf (as F is with M, and more books are on the bottom than top).
5. L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (as L is lower than O).
Looking at the answer choices with this information:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible, but not enough information to confirm.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible, as there must be at least 2 books per shelf.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED], L - Possible, but not enough information to confirm.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible and fits all conditions. K and I on middle, L on bottom.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible, as F and M must be on the bottom shelf together.
Therefore, the only answer choice that could be a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
