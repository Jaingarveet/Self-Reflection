Solution:
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.
Let's assume the length of the space shuttle is "L".
During the 40 seconds, the space shuttle covers a distance of 17.5L m.
The total distance covered by the space shuttle is the sum of the distance covered in 40 seconds and the distance covered in 5 seconds.
Total distance = 17.5L + 87.5
But we know that the total distance is 700m.
Therefore, 17.5L + 87.5 = 700
17.5L = 612.5
L = 35
The length of the space shuttle is 35 x 2 = 70m.
