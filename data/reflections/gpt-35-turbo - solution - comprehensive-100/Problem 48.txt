Solution:
Increasing returns to scale means that as the size of a business or industry increases, the productivity of each worker also increases, leading to more output per worker. 
Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer because the larger bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, which enables the colony to collect more nectar, leading to a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because the larger bee colony is able to produce more output (collect more nectar) with the same amount of input (number of bees).
