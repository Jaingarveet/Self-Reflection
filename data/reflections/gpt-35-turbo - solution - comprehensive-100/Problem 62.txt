Solution:
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the second equation by 3 and adding it to the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations, we get:
$$7y=-80$$
Therefore, $y=-\frac{80}{7}$.
Substituting $y$ in the second equation, we get:
$$2\left(-\frac{80}{7}\right)-x=-19$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$x=3$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(x,y)=(3,-\frac{80}{7})$.
