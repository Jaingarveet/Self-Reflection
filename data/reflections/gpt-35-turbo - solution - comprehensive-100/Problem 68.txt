Solution:
The equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
Substituting $x=[REDACTED]$ and $y=[REDACTED]$ in the equation of the line gives $-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$.
Simplifying this equation gives $k^2-[REDACTED]k+[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]$.
Factoring this equation gives $(k-[REDACTED])(k-[REDACTED])=[REDACTED]$, so $k=[REDACTED]$ is a repeated root.
However, the question asks for which of the following could be the value of $k$, not which is the only possible value of $k$.
Therefore, we need to check the other answer choices to see if they could also be values of $k$.
Substituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives the equation $y=\frac{[REDACTED]}{-2}x$, which does not pass through the point $(2,k)=(2,[REDACTED])$.
Substituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives the equation $y-[REDACTED]=\frac{2[REDACTED]}{6}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y=[REDACTED]x-[REDACTED]$.
This equation passes through the origin and the point $(2,k)=(2,[REDACTED])$, so $k=[REDACTED]$ is a possible value of $k$.
Substituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives the equation $y-[REDACTED]=\frac{[REDACTED]}{1[REDACTED]}(x-2)$, which simplifies to $y=\frac{[REDACTED]}{7}x+\frac{[REDACTED]}{7}$.
This equation does not pass through the point $(k,32)=([REDACTED],32)$.
Therefore, the only possible value of $k$ is $k=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }[REDACTED]}$.
