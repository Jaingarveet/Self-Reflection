Solution:
The passage is primarily about Lady Carlotta's encounter with a struggling horse and her past experiences with interfering on behalf of distressed animals. Lady Carlotta also misses her train and is mistaken for a governess by Mrs. Quabarl. Lady Carlotta accepts the job and is given instructions on how to teach the children. However, these events are secondary to the main idea of the passage. Therefore, the best summary of the passage is that a woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.
