Solution:
The third solo is a traditional piece.
Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.
It is possible that Wayne performs a traditional piece first, followed by two consecutive traditional pieces, and then Zara performs a modern piece in the fourth solo, and Wayne performs a modern piece in the fifth solo.
Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED].
