Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the necessary and sufficient conditions in the argument.
 - Always evaluate whether the argument assumes that the necessary condition is also a sufficient condition.
 - Always consider other possible reasons for the conclusion.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine if it has the same flawed pattern of reasoning.
 - Remember that a necessary condition is not always a sufficient condition.
