Explanation:
My initial approach was correct in calculating the probability of neither event occurring under the assumption of independence. However, I misinterpreted the question's intent in seeking the "greatest value" for this probability. I incorrectly assumed perfect negative correlation, leading to the choice of the higher individual probability. The error lies in overlooking the constraint that the probability of neither event occurring cannot exceed the individual probabilities of each event not occurring.
