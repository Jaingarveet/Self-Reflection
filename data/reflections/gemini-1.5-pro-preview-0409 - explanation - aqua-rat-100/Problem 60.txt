Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of "[REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED]." I incorrectly assumed it meant [REDACTED] was the midpoint of arc A[REDACTED], dividing it into two equal arcs. However, it actually means that line segment A[REDACTED] bisects the angle formed by arc A[REDACTED], not necessarily dividing the arc length equally.
