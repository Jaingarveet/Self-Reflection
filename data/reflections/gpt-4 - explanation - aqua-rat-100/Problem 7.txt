Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and incorrectly calculated the number of unique codes that can be created with a given number of letters. I assumed that a single letter could represent one type of book and a pair of two different letters could represent multiple types of books, which is incorrect. Each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters, meaning that a pair of letters can only represent one type of book, not multiple.
