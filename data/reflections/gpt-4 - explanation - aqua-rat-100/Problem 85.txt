Explanation:
I misunderstood the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom is solely dependent on the speed of the elevator. However, the problem states that you are also walking down the steps, which means that the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom is also dependent on the number of steps you walk.
