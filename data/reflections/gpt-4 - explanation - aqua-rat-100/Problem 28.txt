Explanation:
I misunderstood the question. I calculated the probability of both events not occurring simultaneously, instead of finding the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. The question is asking for the maximum probability that either Stock [REDACTED] or Stock [REDACTED] will not increase in value, not the probability that both will not increase in value.
