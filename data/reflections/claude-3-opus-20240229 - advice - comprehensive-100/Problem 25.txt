Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints before attempting to solve the problem.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice individually and systematically.
 - Never assume an answer choice is correct without verifying it satisfies all constraints.
 - Always pay close attention to the details in each answer choice.
 - If an answer choice violates any single constraint, it cannot be the correct answer, even if it satisfies other constraints.
 - Always double-check your selected answer to ensure your reasoning is correct.
