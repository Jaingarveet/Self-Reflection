Advice:
 - Always consider the "fencepost problem" - if you have x posts, you usually only have x-1 spaces between them.
 - Break the problem into parts - calculate the total contribution from the pickets, then the total contribution from the spaces, then add.
 - Remember to do unit conversions at the end if necessary.
 - Simplify your expression to match the answer choices, factoring out common terms.
 - Double-check your work, especially for off-by-one errors.
