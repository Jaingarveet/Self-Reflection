Advice:
 - Don't just focus on the explicit details; consider implicit assumptions that the argument relies on.
 - Think about counterexamples that could weaken or invalidate the conclusion if the assumption is not true.
 - Pay attention to the scope of the argument and avoid bringing in irrelevant outside factors.
 - In assumption questions, the correct answer choice will be a statement that is not directly stated but is necessary for the argument's reasoning to be valid.
