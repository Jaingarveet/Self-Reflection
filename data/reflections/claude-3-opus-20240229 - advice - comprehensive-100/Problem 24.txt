Advice:
 - Always read the question and constraints carefully.
 - Always consider the implications of each constraint fully before moving on.
 - Always work through the problem sequentially and systematically.
 - If you reach a contradiction or impossible situation, backtrack and reconsider your assumptions.
 - Make sure your final answer satisfies all the given constraints.
 - If a constraint is in the form of an "if-then" statement, consider the implications of both the "if" and "then" parts carefully.
