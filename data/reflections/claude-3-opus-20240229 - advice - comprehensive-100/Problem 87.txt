Advice:
- Focus on the key objects and their most natural physical interactions when evaluating what happens next in a scene.
- Be careful not to overanalyze facial expressions or jump to assumptions about reactions if a simpler physical action is the more likely next step.
- With "most likely" questions, choose the answer describing the most logical next small action, rather than a bigger leap in the situation.
- Put yourself in the shoes of the person in the scenario to simulate the most natural next physical move they would make.
