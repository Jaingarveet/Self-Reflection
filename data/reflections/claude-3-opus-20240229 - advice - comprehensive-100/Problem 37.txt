Advice:
 - Always read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.
 - Focus on the facts directly stated, not just the implications you draw.
 - Be careful not to overemphasize tangential or less relevant information.
 - Always re-evaluate all the choices after your initial selection.
 - The correct answer will be strongly and directly supported, not just potentially inferred.
 - Avoid making assumptions beyond what is clearly implied by the passage.
 - Remember that the question asks what is most supported, not just possibly true.
