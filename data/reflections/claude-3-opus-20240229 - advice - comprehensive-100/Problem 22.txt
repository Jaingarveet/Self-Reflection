Advice:
 - Always fully analyze the constraints before drawing conclusions.
 - Consider all possible scenarios, even if some seem less likely.
 - Don't make unwarranted assumptions or logical leaps.
 - Eliminate answer choices only when they clearly violate a stated constraint.
 - If you're unsure, create a list or diagram to keep track of the possibilities.
 - Remember that "could be true" questions only require one valid scenario, not the only scenario.
