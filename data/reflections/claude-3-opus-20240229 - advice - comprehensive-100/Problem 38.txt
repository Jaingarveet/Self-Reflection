Advice:
 - Always carefully identify the premises and conclusion of an argument.
 - Look for the gap between the premises and conclusion that needs to be bridged by an assumption.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that simply restate the conclusion or premises.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are out of scope, too broad, or unsupported by the given information.
 - The correct assumption should be a statement that, if true, enables the conclusion to be properly drawn from the premises.
