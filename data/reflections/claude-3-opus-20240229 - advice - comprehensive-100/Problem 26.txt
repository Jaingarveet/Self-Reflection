Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities before eliminating an answer choice.
 - Be thorough in your analysis and don't make hasty generalizations.
 - If a choice seems to violate a constraint, try to construct a counterexample to be certain.
 - Carefully apply each constraint to each answer choice to determine its validity.
 - If multiple choices seem possible, re-check the constraints to see if you missed any.
 - Take your time and think through each step carefully to avoid logical errors.
