Instructions:
1. Understand the central theme of the passage: the tension between the "Pin Factory" (increasing returns to scale) and the "Invisible Hand" (harnessing self-interest for the common good). 
2. Identify the role of the railroad reference in the context of this tension. 
3. Recognize that the railroads, like the pin factory, represent an industry with increasing returns, which can lead to market dominance and potential abuse of power. 
4. Understand that this example challenges the assumption that free markets always self-regulate effectively. 
5. Choose the answer option that best captures the purpose of the railroad reference in light of this understanding.
