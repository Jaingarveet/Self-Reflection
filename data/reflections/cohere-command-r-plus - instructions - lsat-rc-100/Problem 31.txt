2. Identify the key information in the passage that relates to the question.
3. Analyze the relationships and implications of the information presented.
4. Determine which option is directly supported by the passage's content and structure.
5. Avoid making assumptions or interpreting the information beyond what is explicitly stated.

Step-by-step solution: 
1. The passage discusses the city's plan to address overdue water bills.
2. The key information is that officials plan to "selectively" target a few residences, particularly in high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of residents with outstanding bills.
3. The selective nature of the plan implies that most residences with overdue bills have not been targeted previously.
4. Choice [REDACTED] directly reflects this inference: "In recent years, the city has rarely, if ever, turned off the water of customers who were late paying their water bills."
5. The other choices are either unsupported or inaccurate based on the information provided.
