Instructions:
1. Understand the context: The debate centers on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, with two opposing viewpoints and an economic principle to reconcile them. 
2. Identify the author's stance: The author suggests that the two strategies are not mutually exclusive and that an optimal approach combines elements from both. 
3. Analyze each statement: 
    - [REDACTED]: Stricter punishments increase expected costs, supporting a decrease in recidivism. 
    - [REDACTED]: Ending rehabilitation removes a source of increased expected utility for lawful activity, potentially increasing criminal activity. 
    - [REDACTED]: Increasing the expected utility of lawful activities makes unlawful activities less attractive, decreasing deliberate crimes. 
    - [REDACTED]: Restricting access decreases expected utility for lawful activity, making unlawful activities relatively more attractive. 
    - [REDACTED]: Stronger law enforcement decreases the expected utility of criminal activity, making it less attractive. 
4. Identify the inverse relationship: Statement [REDACTED] presents the inverse relationship between the expected utility of lawful activity and the rate of deliberate crimes. 
5. Correct interpretation: Increasing the expected utility of lawful activities makes unlawful activities less attractive, leading to a decrease in deliberate crimes, not an increase.
