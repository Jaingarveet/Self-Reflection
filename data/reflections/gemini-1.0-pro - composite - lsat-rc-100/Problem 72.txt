Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the passage supported the statement that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. 
While the passage does state that high lipid levels are dangerous and contribute to premature heart disease, it does not explicitly link them to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. 
Instead, the passage focuses on the effects of alcohol on lipid processing and the potential benefits of wine consumption on these factors.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Inference error
 - Missing information error
Solution:
The passage states that high lipid levels are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease.
The passage does not state that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness.
The passage states that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness.
The passage does not provide evidence to support the statement that greater platelet adhesiveness increases the risk of premature heart disease.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the passage and identify the main points and supporting evidence.
2. Pay close attention to the author's claims and arguments.
3. Do not make assumptions or inferences that are not explicitly supported by the text.
4. If a statement is not directly supported by the passage, do not select it as the answer.
5. Choose the answer that is most consistent with the information presented in the passage.
Advice:
 - Be cautious about making assumptions or drawing conclusions that are not explicitly stated in the text.
 - Focus on identifying the author's main points and supporting evidence.
 - If you are unsure about an answer, reread the relevant portion of the passage carefully.
 - Do not select an answer that contradicts information presented in the passage.
