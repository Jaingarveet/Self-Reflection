Explanation:
I incorrectly inferred that the test case strategy was a [REDACTED] component of public interest litigation. 
The passage states that the test case strategy was a novel approach developed by Marshall and the NAACP. 
I failed to recognize the distinction between a [REDACTED] component and a novel approach.
Error Keywords:
 - Inference error
 - Distinction error
 - Necessary vs. novel
Solution:
The passage states that Marshall and the NAACP developed a test case strategy.
The passage does not state that the test case strategy is a [REDACTED] component of public interest litigation.
Therefore, it cannot be reasonably inferred that the author views the test case strategy as [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the passage and identify the key points.
2. Pay attention to the author's tone and perspective.
3. Avoid making inferences that are not explicitly supported by the text.
4. Distinguish between [REDACTED] components and novel approaches.
5. Choose the answer that is most consistent with the author's观点.
Advice:
 - When making inferences, ensure they are logically supported by the text.
 - Be cautious of drawing conclusions that go beyond the scope of the passage.
 - Consider the author's perspective and potential biases.
 - Distinguish between facts, opinions, and inferences.
 - Choose the answer that best reflects the author's intended meaning.
