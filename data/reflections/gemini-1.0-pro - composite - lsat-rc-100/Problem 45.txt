Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the primary factor driving the transition to the new digital model. While the author mentions several advantages of the new model, the primary factor driving the transition is the demand from literary agents for a larger share of the proceeds for their authors.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of author's argument
 - Failure to identify primary driving factor
 - Overemphasis on secondary factors
Solution:
The author argues that the new digital model of publishing will be more efficient and convenient for customers than traditional publishing.
The author also argues that the new digital model will allow authors to receive a larger share of the proceeds from their work.
The author concludes by saying that traditional publishers will have to adjust to the new digital model or they will lose their authors.
The author's main argument is that the new digital model will be more profitable for authors. This is the primary factor driving the transition to the new model.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the author's argument and identify the main point.
2. Identify the factors that the author cites as supporting the main point.
3. Determine which factor is the most important in driving the transition to the new model.
4. Choose the answer that corresponds to the most important driving factor.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the author's main argument and supporting points.
 - Do not be misled by secondary factors that may be mentioned but are not the primary driving force.
 - Consider the author's overall purpose and the context of the argument.
 - Be clear and concise in your reasoning and explanation.
