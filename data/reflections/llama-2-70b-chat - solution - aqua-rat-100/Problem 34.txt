Solution:
Let's first calculate the cost price of the book.

Cost price = Selling price - Profit
= 27.50 - 10% of 27.50
= 27.50 - 2.75
= 24.75

Now, let's calculate the new selling price.

New selling price = 25.75

Profit = New selling price - Cost price
= 25.75 - 24.75
= 3%

Since the profit is 3%, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].
