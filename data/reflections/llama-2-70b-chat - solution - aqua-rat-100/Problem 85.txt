Solution:
1. You walk 20 steps and stop; you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. You walk 10 steps and stop; you reach the ground in 20 minutes.

Now, let's analyze the information:

If you walk 20 steps and stop, you cover 20 steps in 10 minutes.
That means, in 1 minute, you cover 20/10 = 2 steps.

If you walk 10 steps and stop, you cover 10 steps in 20 minutes.
That means, in 1 minute, you cover 10/20 = 0.5 steps.

Now, we can calculate the speed of the elevator:

Speed = Distance / Time

In the first case, distance = 20 steps, time = 10 minutes = 10/60 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
So, speed = 20/10 = 2 steps/minute.

In the second case, distance = 10 steps, time = 20 minutes = 20/60 hours.
So, speed = 10/20 = 0.5 steps/minute.

Since the speed of the elevator is constant, we can take the average of the two speeds:

Average speed = (2 steps/minute + 0.5 steps/minute) / 2 = 1.5 steps/minute.

Now, let's look at the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is less than the average speed we calculated.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is equal to the average speed we calculated.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is greater than the average speed we calculated.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is greater than the average speed we calculated.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is incorrect since we have found a valid answer.
