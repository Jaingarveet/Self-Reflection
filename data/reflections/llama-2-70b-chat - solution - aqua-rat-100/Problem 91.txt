Solution:
Let's break down A's journey:

1. [REDACTED] travels 3 km towards the south.
2. Then, [REDACTED] travels 5 km towards the east.
3. Next, [REDACTED] travels 3 km towards the north.
4. Finally, [REDACTED] travels 2 km towards the west.

We can represent A's journey as a right triangle with legs of length 3 km and 5 km, and a hypotenuse of unknown length.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse:

Hypotenuse = sqrt(3^2 + 5^2)

= sqrt(9 + 25)

= sqrt(34)

= 6 km

So, [REDACTED] is 6 km away from home.
