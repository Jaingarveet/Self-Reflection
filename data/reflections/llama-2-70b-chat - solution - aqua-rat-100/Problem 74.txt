Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. [REDACTED] regular pentagon has five vertices: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
2. We can form a quadrilateral by joining four of these vertices.
3. There are [REDACTED]C4 ways to choose four vertices from five: [REDACTED] × 4 × 3 × 2 = [REDACTED]0 ways.
4. However, we need to divide this result by the number of ways to rotate the quadrilateral, which is 4 (90, 180, 270, or 360 degrees).
[REDACTED]. Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is [REDACTED]0/4 = 30.
