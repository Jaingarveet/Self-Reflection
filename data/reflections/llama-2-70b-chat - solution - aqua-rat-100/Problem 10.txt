Solution:
1. The space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
2. It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its horizontal speed is 700/5 = 140 m/s.
3. The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
4. The length of the space shuttle (L) can be found using the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds in this case).
5. Substituting the values, we get L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 9[REDACTED].

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 9[REDACTED], which corresponds to choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
