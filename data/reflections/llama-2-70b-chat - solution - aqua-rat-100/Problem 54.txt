Solution:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be x.
According to the statement, Meenu said she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight.
So, Meenu's weight can be represented as: x + (x/2) + x = 3x/2
Now, we know that Meenu's weight is 29 kg plus half of her weight, which is 29 + (29/2) = 29 + 14.5 = 43.5 kg.
