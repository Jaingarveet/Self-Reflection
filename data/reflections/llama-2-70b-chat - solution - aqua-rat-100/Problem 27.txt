Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. M men agree to purchase a gift for Rs. [REDACTED].
2. 3 men drop out, leaving M - 3 men.
3. The total amount [REDACTED] remains the same.
4. The contribution of each man will increase because there are fewer men to share the cost.
5. The new contribution per man can be found by dividing the total amount [REDACTED] by the number of men remaining, M - 3.

So, the correct answer is:
[REDACTED] / (M - 3)

Which is option [REDACTED].
