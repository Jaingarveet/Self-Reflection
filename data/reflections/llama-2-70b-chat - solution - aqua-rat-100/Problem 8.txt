Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so we can write an equation:

Bus fare = (4/3) * Train fare

2. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6 * Bus fare = 6 * (4/3) * Train fare = 8 * Train fare.

3. The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8 * Train fare.

4. The total fare paid by both groups is Rs.1512, so we can set up the equation:

8 * Train fare + 8 * Train fare = 1512

5. Simplifying the equation, we get:

16 * Train fare = 1512

6. Dividing both sides by 16, we get:

Train fare = 94

Therefore, the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is Rs.94.
