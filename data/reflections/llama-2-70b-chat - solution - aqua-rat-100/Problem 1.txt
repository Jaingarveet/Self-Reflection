Solution:
Let's first determine the volume of the rectangular solid.
Volume = Length × Width × Height
Volume = 3 × 4 × 15
Volume = 60

Since the solid is inscribed in a sphere, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the solid.

We can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:
V = (4/3)πr³

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Now, we can set up the equation:
(4/3)πr³ = 60

We can solve for r:
r³ = (60/(4/3)) = 3^3 = 27
r = 3

Now, we can find the diameter of the sphere:
diameter = 2r = 2(3) = 6

So, the diameter of the sphere is 6.
