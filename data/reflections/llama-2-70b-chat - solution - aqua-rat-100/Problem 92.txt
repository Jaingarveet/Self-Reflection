Solution:
Let X be the number of sales made.
The total amount of sales made is [REDACTED]0X.
The total commission earned is 10% of [REDACTED]0X = [REDACTED]X.
The total salary earned is [REDACTED]X + 1000.

We want to find X such that [REDACTED]X + 1000 ≥ 1000.

[REDACTED]X ≥ 0

X ≥ 0

Since X is a whole number, X ≥ 1.

Therefore, the salesperson must make at least [REDACTED] sales of $[REDACTED]0 to reach a salary of at least $1000.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
