Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.
2. y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.
3. We want to find the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.
4. We can set up a proportion using the rates:
x/x = y/y
x2/x2 = y2/y2
5. Therefore, the correct answer is:
