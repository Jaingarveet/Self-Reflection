Solution:
Let's assume the number of hours Alex works be x.
Since both Alex and Jacob work for almost a similar number of hours, the number of hours Jacob works is also x.

We know that Alex makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.
Similarly, Jacob makes 35 toys in x hours, so his toy-making rate is 35/x.

Since both Alex and Jacob work for the same number of hours, the total number of toys they make is the sum of their individual toy-making rates:
35/x + 35/x = 70/x

Now, we want to find out how many toys Jacob makes. We can set up the following equation:
70/x = 9(35)

Solving for x, we get:
x = 70/9
x = 7.78

Since Jacob works for 9 hours, the number of toys he makes is:
35/x = 35/7.78 = 4.55

So, Jacob makes 4 toys less than Alex. Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
