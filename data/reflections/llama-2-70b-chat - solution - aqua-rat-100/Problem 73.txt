Solution:
Let's assume the total number of students in the school to be x.
Since 20% of the students took physics, the number of students who took physics is 0.2x (not necessarily an integer).
Similarly, since 28% of the students took math, the number of students who took math is 0.28x (not necessarily an integer).
We know that 0.2x and 0.28x are both proportions of x, so we can write:
0.2x = k/100 (where k is a proportion)
0.28x = m/100 (where m is a proportion)

We can write the equation:
k/100 + m/100 â‰¤ 1 (since some students may have taken both physics and math)

We want to find the least possible value of x.

We can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 0.2 and 0.28:
LCM(0.2, 0.28) = 0.4

So, the least possible value of x is 0.4(1000) = 400.

Therefore, the answer is:
