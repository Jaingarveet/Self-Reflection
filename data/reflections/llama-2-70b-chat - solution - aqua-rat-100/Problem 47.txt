Solution:
Let's re-solve the problem using the correct formula:

1. The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their running speed is M/4 miles per hour.
2. The athlete then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their cycling speed is N/4 miles per hour.
3. To find the average speed for both activities combined, we need to add the running and cycling speeds and divide by 2.

The correct formula is (M + N) / 8, which is choice [REDACTED].
