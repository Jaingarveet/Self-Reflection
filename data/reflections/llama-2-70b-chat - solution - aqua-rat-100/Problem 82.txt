Solution:
Let's assume the field is a square with side length x.
The area of the field is x^2.
The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so it will take approximately x^2/10 days to graze the whole field.
We can simplify the calculation by recognizing that x^2/10 â‰ˆ 14^2/10 = 196/10 = 19.6.
Therefore, the cow will take approximately 19.6 days to graze the whole field.
