Solution:
Let X be the monthly sales.
The monthly salary S of a shop assistant can be represented as:
S = 500 + (5/100) * X

We want S to reach $1500, so we set up an equation:
500 + (5/100) * X = 1500

Now, we can solve for X:
X = (1500 - 500) / (5/100)
X = 100000 / 5
X = 20000

Therefore, the monthly sales should be [REDACTED] for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]") [REDACTED].
