Solution:
The rate of the man along the current can be calculated by finding the rate in still water and the rate against the current, and then subtracting the rate against the current from the rate in still water.

4 kmph (rate in still water) - 2 kmph (rate against the current) = 2 kmph

Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 2 kmph.
