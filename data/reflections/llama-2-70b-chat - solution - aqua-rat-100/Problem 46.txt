Solution:
Let X be the monthly income of the man.

We know that he spends Rs. 3500 per month, so his savings are:
S = X - 3500

We are also given that he saves 12 1/2% of his income, so:
S = 0.125X

Now, we can set up the equation:
0.125X - 3500 = 12 1/2% of X

Simplifying, we get:
0.125X = 4000

Dividing both sides by 0.125, we get:
X = 32,000

So, the man's monthly income is Rs. 32,000.
