Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm.
2. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters.
3. The radius of each semi-circle is half the side length of the square, which is 10 cm.
4. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius.
5. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2(1/2)π(10cm)^2 = 20π cm^2.
6. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the original square minus the total area of the two semi-circles.
7. The area of the original square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 20π = [REDACTED] cm^2.
