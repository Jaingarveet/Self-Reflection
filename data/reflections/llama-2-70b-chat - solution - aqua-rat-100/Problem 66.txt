Solution:
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The common difference between consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (AP) is 3 years, not 3 months.
The sum of the ages of all members is [REDACTED]0.

Now, let's find the number of members in the club:

The first member's age is 7.
The second member's age is 10 (7 + 3).
The third member's age is 13 (10 + 3).
The fourth member's age is 16 (13 + 3).
The fifth member's age is 19 (16 + 3).

We can see a pattern here. Each member's age is 3 years older than the previous member's age.

The number of members in the club is the number of ages we have:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 5.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
