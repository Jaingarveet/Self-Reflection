Solution:
Let's say the original price of the product was $100.
If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price would be $100 - (30% of $100) = $100 - $30 = $70.

To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100% again, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price

= ($100 - $70) / $70
= $30 / $70
= [REDACTED]
