Solution:
Kevin drove from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] at a constant speed of 70 mph.
The time it took him to reach [REDACTED] is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70

The distance traveled to [REDACTED] is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70

Since he turned right around and returned to [REDACTED] at a constant speed of [REDACTED] mph, the time it took him to return to [REDACTED] is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED]

The distance traveled back to [REDACTED] is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled to [REDACTED] and the distance traveled back to [REDACTED]:

Total distance = Distance to [REDACTED] + Distance back to A
Total distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70 + [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
Total distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70 + [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]

Now, let's look at the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too small
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too small
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too small
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] miles - Too large
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Incorrect, there is a valid answer

The correct answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
