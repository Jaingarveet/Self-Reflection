Solution:
The correct solution is as follows:
The probability that neither of the two events will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that at least one of the events will occur.
Let's first calculate the probability that at least one of the events will occur:
P(at least one) = P([REDACTED] or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P([REDACTED] and B)
= 0.56 + 0.74 - (0.56 x 0.74)
= 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.41
= 0.89

Now, we can calculate the probability that neither of these two events will occur:
P(neither) = 1 - 0.89 = 0.11

Since the choices are not exhaustive, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.11, which is not among the given choices.
