Solution:
Let's re-read the question carefully. The question states that the same number of boys and girls joined the group during the membership drive. This means that the number of boys who joined the group is equal to the number of girls who joined the group.

Let's assume that the number of boys who joined the group is x and the number of girls who joined the group is also x.

We know that the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x, and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.

Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can set up the equation:
(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/3

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 120

Now, we can find the value of x:
x = 120/4
x = 30

So, the number of boys who joined the group is 30, and the number of girls who joined the group is also 30.

Now, we can find the total number of members in the group:
Total members = 64 + 30 + 40 + 30 = [REDACTED]

The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
