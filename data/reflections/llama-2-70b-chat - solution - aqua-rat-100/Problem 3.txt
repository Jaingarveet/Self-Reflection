Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The square piece of cloth has side length x.
2. After trimming 4 feet off one edge, the rectangle has a length of x - 4 and a width of x.
3. The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the rectangle is 2 \* 70 = 140 square feet.
4. The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(x - 4) + 2x = 2x - 8.
5. Since the original square had a perimeter of 4x, we can set up the equation:

2x - 8 = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 4x + 8
2x - 4x = 8
x = 8

So, the side length of the original square was 8 feet.
