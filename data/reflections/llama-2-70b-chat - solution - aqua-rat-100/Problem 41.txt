Solution:
Let's assume the number of friends who attended the picnic is x.
The total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96.
Since four friends did not turn up, the amount spent by the remaining friends is Rs. 96 / x.
Since each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the total amount spent by them is Rs. 96 / x + 4x.
We want to find the value of x for which the above expression is equal to Rs. 96.

Rs. 96 / x + 4x = Rs. 96

Simplifying, we get:

x = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is [REDACTED].
