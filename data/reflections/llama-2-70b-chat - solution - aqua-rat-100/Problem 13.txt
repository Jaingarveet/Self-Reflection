Solution:
Let's X be the original number.
Then, we have:
7/8 * X = 7/18 * X + 770 ... (1)

Multiplying both sides of equation (1) by 8, we get:
7X = 7/9 * X + 6160 ... (2)

Subtracting 7/9 * X from both sides of equation (2), we get:
6X = 6160

Dividing both sides of equation (3) by 6, we get:
X = 1027

Therefore, the number is 1027.
