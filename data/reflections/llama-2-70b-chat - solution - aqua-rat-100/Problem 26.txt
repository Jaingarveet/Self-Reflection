Solution:
Let's first calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle:
Length = 27 cm
Breadth = 17 cm

The wire is bent to form a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square "s".

We know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the length of the wire.
Perimeter of the square = s + s + s + s
= 4s

We also know that the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length plus the breadth.
Perimeter of the rectangle = Length + Breadth
= 27 + 17
= 44

Since the wire is bent to form a square, the perimeter of the square must be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.
4s = 44

Now, we can solve for "s":
s = [REDACTED]

So, the length of each side of the square is [REDACTED] cm.
