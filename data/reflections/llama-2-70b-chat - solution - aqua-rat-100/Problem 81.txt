Solution:
Let X be the number of grams of health food to be eaten daily.

Since 1 gram of health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin [REDACTED], X grams will contain 9% of X grams = 0.09X

Similarly, since 1 gram of health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin [REDACTED], X grams will contain 8% of X grams = 0.08X

To meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need 0.09X >= 100% and 0.08X >= 100%.

Solving the system of inequalities, we get:

0.09X >= 100%
0.08X >= 100%

X >= 11.11

Since the answer is rounded to the nearest integer, we have:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]") [REDACTED]
