Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The number of deer caught during the first year is [REDACTED].
2. The number of deer caught during the second year is [REDACTED].
3. The number of deer with tags from the previous year in the second-year sample is 20.
4. To find the total deer population, we need to use the proportion of deer with tags in the second-year sample and apply it to the total number of deer caught in the first year.
5. The proportion of deer with tags in the second-year sample is 20/[REDACTED] = 0.04.
6. To find the total deer population, we can multiply the proportion by the number of deer caught in the first year: 0.04 x [REDACTED] = 12.
7. However, this calculation assumes that the population of deer in the forest has remained constant between the two years.
8. Since there is no information to suggest that the population has changed, we should assume that the population remains the same.
9. Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is still 12.
