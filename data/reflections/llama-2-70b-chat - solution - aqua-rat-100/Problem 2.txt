Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The average weight of the 10 vehicles before adding the new truck is 12.2 tons.
2. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck.
3. To find the weight of the new truck, we can use the formula for finding the new average:

New average = Old average + (Change in weight / Number of items)

In this case, the change in weight is 2.6 tons, and the number of items has increased by 1 (the new truck).

New average = 12.2 + (2.6 / 11)

New average = 12.2 + 0.236

New average = 12.436

Since the new average is 12.436 tons, the weight of the new truck must be the difference between the new average and the old average:

Weight of new truck = New average - Old average

Weight of new truck = 12.436 - 12.2

Weight of new truck = 0.236 tons

Now, we can check our choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The weight of the new truck is 0.236 tons, which is closest to choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
