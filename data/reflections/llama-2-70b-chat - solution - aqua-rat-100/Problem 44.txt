Solution:
8 men work for 6 days to complete a work.
1 day = 24 hours
1/2 day = 12 hours

Number of men required to complete the work in 1 day = 8 men / 6 days = 8/6 = 1 1/3 men

Number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day = 1 1/3 men / 2 = 11/2 = 5 1/2 men

Since we can't have a fraction of a man, we round up to the nearest whole number.
Therefore, 6 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.
