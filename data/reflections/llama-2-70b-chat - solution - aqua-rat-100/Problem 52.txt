Solution:
Let the amount of zinc in alloy X be 6x grams and the amount of copper be 9x grams.
Let the amount of zinc in alloy Y be 7y grams and the amount of copper be 11y grams.
When 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed, the total amount of zinc is 6x + 7y grams, and the total amount of copper is 9x + 11y grams.
We can set up a proportion to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:
(6x + 7y) / (9x + 11y) = (zinc in Z) / (copper in Z)

We can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying:
6x + 7y = 9x + 11y

Subtracting 7y from both sides gives us:
6x = 2y

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:
x = 2y/6

Substituting y = 11y/7 from the second equation, we get:
x = 2(11y/7) / 6

Simplifying, we get:
x = 11y/14

Now, we can find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:
Ratio of zinc in Z = 6x = 6(11y/14) = 11y/2

Ratio of copper in Z = 9x = 9(11y/14) = 11y/2

Therefore, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 11y/2:11y/2, which simplifies to 1:1.
