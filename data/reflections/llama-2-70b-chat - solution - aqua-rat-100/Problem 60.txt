Solution:
Points [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED] lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], and minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150Â°. Since [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is half of [REDACTED], which is [REDACTED]. Therefore, the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED].
