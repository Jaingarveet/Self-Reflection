Solution:
There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we want to choose 2 oranges.
We can choose the first orange in 10 ways, and the second orange in 10 ways (since the order of the oranges does not matter).
By the combination formula, the total number of ways to choose 2 oranges is C(10, 2) = [REDACTED].
