Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. Mr. Brown paints a house in 6 days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x 6 = 1[REDACTED] days.
2. Mr. Brown goes on vacation after [REDACTED] days, so he has painted 3 houses in [REDACTED] days.
3. Mr. Black starts working after [REDACTED] days, so he has 1[REDACTED] - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] days to paint 3 houses.
4. Mr. Black can paint a house in [REDACTED] days, so he can paint 3 houses in 3 x [REDACTED] = 24 days.
5. Since Mr. Black has [REDACTED] days to paint 3 houses, he will finish in [REDACTED] days.
6. Mr. Blue will finish the contract in [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] = 2 days.
