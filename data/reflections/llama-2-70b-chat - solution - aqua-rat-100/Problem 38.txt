Solution:
[REDACTED] hollow cube of size 5cm is taken, with the thickness of 1cm. It is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm.
The surface area of the outer cube is 6*5^2 = 300 square centimeters.
Each small cube has 6 faces, and each face has an area of 1^2 = 1 square centimeter.
The number of small cubes on the surface of the outer cube is 300/1 = 300.
Since each small cube has 6 faces, the total number of faces on the surface of the outer cube is 300*6 = 1800.
Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, all the faces of the small cubes on the surface are painted.
The number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted is 6*5^2 - 300*6 = [REDACTED].
