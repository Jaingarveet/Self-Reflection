Explanation:
I missed a constraint in my initial assessment of the choices. 
I focused on the conditions related to Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Julio, but I overlooked the constraint regarding Lan and Olivia. 
I should have paid closer attention to the condition that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
