Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conditions and made assumptions that led me to the wrong conclusion. I incorrectly assumed that the [REDACTED] condition referred to the positions of F and R, when in fact, it referred to the number of compositions between F and R or between R and F. This misunderstanding led me to place F and R in specific positions, narrowing down other options incorrectly.
