Explanation:
I misinterpreted one of the conditions and made an error in my logical reasoning. 
I focused on condition 2, "At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F," and chose an option with one composition between F and R, thinking it came closest to satisfying this condition. However, I overlooked the fact that option [REDACTED] has two compositions between R and F, which fully satisfies this condition.
