Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conditions and made logical errors in my reasoning. 
I focused on the conditions related to the placement of T and F and overlooked the condition "At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F." 
This condition rules out choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], as it requires at least two compositions to be placed between F and R.
