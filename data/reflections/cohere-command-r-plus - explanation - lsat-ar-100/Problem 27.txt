Explanation:
I misinterpreted the constraint "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other." I incorrectly assumed that only two students could review each play. However, the constraint refers to the overall combination of plays reviewed, not individual plays. My error led me to choose an incomplete list of students reviewing Tamerlane.
