Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition regarding the order of articles 'S' and 'Q'. 
I incorrectly assumed that 'S' being earlier than 'Q' was a necessary condition, when in fact, it was only a necessary condition for 'Q' being third. 
I overlooked the possibility of 'Q' being first or second while still satisfying the conditions.
