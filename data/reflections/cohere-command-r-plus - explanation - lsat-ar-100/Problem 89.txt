Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition "The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies." I incorrectly assumed that this meant these two batches had to be made in the same week. However, the question only states that there are three batches of each cookie made each week, without specifying that all three batches of a particular cookie must be made within the same week. 

The correct interpretation is that the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies could be made in different weeks, allowing for more flexibility in the scheduling.
