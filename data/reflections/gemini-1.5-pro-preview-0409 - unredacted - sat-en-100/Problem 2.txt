## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the emphasis on separate spheres for men and women as implying a direct comparison of skill sets. The passage, however, focuses more on the nature of the tasks, portraying women's roles as inherently gentle and peaceful, not necessarily requiring complex skills.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Inference error
*   Misinterpretation of tone/implication
*   Overthinking the comparison between roles 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Review the question:** Focus on what can be inferred about the authors' beliefs regarding household and child-rearing tasks.
2. **Reread relevant sections of Passage 1:** Pay close attention to descriptions of women's roles and the language used.
3. **Analyze the tone and implications:**  Identify the portrayal of women's duties and the adjectives used (delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, gentle occupations).

    *   Choice A is not mentioned.
    *   Choice B is implied but not the focus.
    *   Choice D is my misinterpretation.
