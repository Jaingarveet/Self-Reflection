## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the table and focused on the presence of all four pathogens individually within the colony rather than the simultaneous presence of all four in each bee.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Table misinterpretation 
*   Data misreading
*   Logical error
**Solution:**
1.  **Identify the target data:** We need the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder where bees were infected by **all four pathogens simultaneously**.
2.  **Locate the correct row:** Look for the row labeled "All four pathogens" in the table.
3.  **Find the relevant column:** Focus on the column titled "Colonies with colony collapse disorder (%)".
4.  **Read the value:** The intersection of the identified row and column shows **77%**.
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Carefully analyze table headings and labels:** Ensure you understand what each row and column represents.
2.  **Pay attention to specific wording:** Distinguish between "all pathogens present in the colony" and "all pathogens present in each bee".
3.  **Cross-reference data points:** If unsure, check other rows or columns for clarification.
4.  **Consider the context:** Relate the data to the information provided in the passage.
**General Advice:**
*   **Read questions thoroughly:** Understand the specific information or data point being asked.
*   **Break down complex questions:** Divide them into smaller, manageable parts.
*   **Focus on relevant information:** Avoid being misled by extraneous data or wording.
*   **Double-check your reasoning:** Ensure your interpretation aligns with the data and the question.
