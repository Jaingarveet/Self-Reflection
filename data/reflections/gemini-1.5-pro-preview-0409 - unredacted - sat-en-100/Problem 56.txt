## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I focused too narrowly on the act of payment and the narrator's intent to pay less than expected. I failed to consider the larger context of the value of the books and the meager sum the narrator could afford.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Ignoring context
*   Overlooking implied meaning
**Solution:**
1.  **Reread the relevant passage:** Focus on the description of the narrator's payment and the value of the books.
2.  **Analyze the narrator's financial situation:** He saves small amounts of money given for treats and can only afford "a booklet of cigarette papers" with that amount.
3.  **Consider the value of the books:** The bookshop is described as containing valuable old books, and the narrator is allowed to read any book he wants.
4.  **Compare the narrator's payment to the value of the books:** The small amount of money is clearly much less than the actual worth of the books.
5.  **Choose the answer reflecting the significant difference in value:** Option D accurately describes the situation.
**Instructions for Future Questions:**
1.  Read the entire passage and question carefully.
2.  Identify key details and their relationships within the context.
3.  Consider the implied meaning and author's intent beyond the literal words.
4.  Evaluate each answer choice against the full understanding of the passage.
5.  Choose the answer that best reflects the overall context and nuances of the text.
