## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My focus on Chie's amusement and maternal view of Akira led me to the incorrect conclusion. While the passage does mention these aspects, it fails to directly address Akira's fear of Chie underestimating his sincerity. The more prominent concern is Chie's potential disapproval of his direct approach, breaking tradition and bypassing formalities.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation
*   Focus on irrelevant detail
*   Ignoring key textual evidence 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify Akira's actions:** He directly approaches Chie with a marriage proposal, bypassing traditional protocols.
2.  **Analyze Chie's reaction:** She expresses surprise and questions the appropriateness of his approach ("Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!").
3.  **Connect actions to possible fears:** Akira's direct approach and Chie's reaction suggest his primary fear is her disapproval of his unconventional method.
