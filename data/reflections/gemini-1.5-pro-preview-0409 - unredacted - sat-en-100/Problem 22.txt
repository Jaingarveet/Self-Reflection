## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the task. Instead of focusing on complementary base pairs (A-T and G-C), I looked for pairs with similar percentages, assuming the question was about the consistency of base percentages across organisms.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Assumption error
*   Ignoring context
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Recall base pairing rules:** Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C).
2.  **Examine the table for Sea Urchin:** Look for percentages that correspond to a known base pair.
3.  **Identify the match:** 17.3% and 17.7% likely correspond to Cytosine and Guanine, respectively.
## Future Instructions
1.  **Carefully read and understand the question:** Pay attention to keywords and context.
2.  **Recall relevant knowledge:** In this case, base pairing rules in DNA.
3.  **Analyze the data:** Look for patterns or specific values that support the answer.
4.  **Avoid assumptions:** Base your answer on evidence from the text and your knowledge.
## General Advice
*   **Focus on understanding the core concepts:** This will help you apply knowledge to different contexts.
*   **Practice active reading:** Pay attention to details and identify key information.
*   **Develop critical thinking skills:** Question assumptions and analyze evidence before drawing conclusions. 
*   **Review past mistakes:** Learn from errors to avoid repeating them.
