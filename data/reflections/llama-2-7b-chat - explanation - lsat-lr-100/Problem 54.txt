Explanation:
The reasoning error in the argument is (E) [REDACTED].

The argument assumes that since Hana had expressed an interest in the recording, her brothers must have been among the guests at her birthday party. However, the argument fails to consider the possibility that Hana's interest in the recording may be compatible with her decision not to invite her brothers to her birthday party.

For example, Hana may have changed her mind about inviting her brothers to her birthday party after discovering that they had planned to give her the recording. In this case, their presence at the party would not necessarily be a guarantee that they had a legitimate reason to be there.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
