Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]

The difference in the goals of movie executives and television executives can be attributed to the difference in revenue streams. Movie executives primarily rely on ticket sales to generate profits, which requires a large audience. In contrast, television executives rely on advertising revenue, which is generated through sponsorships. Sponsors are primarily concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show, which means they are more interested in attracting a loyal audience rather than maximizing the number of viewers. Therefore, the primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to create engaging content that attracts a loyal audience.
