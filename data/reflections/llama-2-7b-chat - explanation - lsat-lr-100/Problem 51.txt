Explanation:
The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism because it assumes without providing justification that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change. This inference is not supported by evidence and is potentially flawed.

Other factors, such as decreased trust in government or increased cynicism about politics, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout, and the argument does not consider these alternative explanations. Therefore, the argument is vulnerable to criticism for making an unwarranted inference.

The correct answer is (C) Infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change.
