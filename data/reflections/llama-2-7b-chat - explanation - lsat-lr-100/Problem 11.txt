Explanation:
The argument's reasoning is questionable because it makes a causal link between the use of personal automobiles and the geography of modern cities without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim. The argument assumes that the widespread use of personal automobiles is the primary factor responsible for the current geography of modern cities, but it does not consider other possible factors that may have contributed to this geography.

The correct answer is (B) because the argument infers that the current geography of modern cities resulted from the use of personal automobiles, and suggests that other facets of modern life also resulted from this cause. The argument does not consider the possibility that other technological innovations, such as public transportation or urban planning, may have also played a role in shaping the geography of modern cities.

Keywords: causality, technological innovation, urban planning, public transportation, geography.
