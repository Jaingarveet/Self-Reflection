Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]

The argument in the passage is based on a comparison between the two groups, but it does not take into account individual factors that may affect the patients' survival rates. The statement (C) acknowledges that there may be individual differences within each group that could affect the survival rates, and therefore, the conclusion that support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer is not necessarily valid.

Here's why the other options do not weaken the argument:

(A) does not provide any information about the survival rates of the patients who attended support group meetings.
(B) is irrelevant to the argument, as the passage does not mention anything about attending support group meetings being part of the standard medical treatment for disease T.
(D) is also irrelevant, as it does not provide any information about the effect of attending support group meetings on patients' survival rates.
(E) is not a valid counterargument, as it only suggests that the patients in the group that attended support meetings reported that those meetings had helped them cope with the disease, which does not address the issue of survival rates.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]
