Solution:
The text describes a sequence of actions:
1. The young man pockets balls.
2. He retrieves the balls and places them in a metal triangle (rack).
3. He arranges the other balls, likely setting them up for a new game.
4. (*Correct completion*) ... the young man strikes the cue ball but immediately stops it with the cue stick, indicating a practice stroke or a moment of contemplation before taking the actual shot.

This completion aligns with the context of setting up for a new game and the young man's deliberate actions.
