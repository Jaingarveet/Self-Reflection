Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering the contrapositive of the conditional statement. 
If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%. 
The contrapositive of this statement is: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, then it cannot increase productivity by 10%. 
Therefore, if Green Island does not increase productivity by 10%, it does not necessarily mean it will go bankrupt. 
The correct answer is A because if Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding contrapositive
 - Conditional statement error
 - Logical negation error
Solution:
If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, then it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt.
The contrapositive of the conditional statement is: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, then it cannot increase productivity by 10%.
Therefore, if Green Island does not increase productivity by 10%, it does not necessarily mean it will go bankrupt.
If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the conditional statement and its contrapositive.
3. Consider all possible outcomes based on the given information.
4. Choose the answer that must be true based on the given information.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always consider the contrapositive of a conditional statement.
 - Always think through all possible outcomes based on the given information.
 - Never assume any information that is not explicitly stated.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that a conditional statement is not equivalent to its contrapositive.
