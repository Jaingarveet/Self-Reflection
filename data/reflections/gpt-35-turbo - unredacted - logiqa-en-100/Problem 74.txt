Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the requirements. 
I only considered the requirement that Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected with Qiu Zhijie. 
However, there is another requirement that Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected at the same time. 
Therefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. 
Since Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected, the answer is A: Tang Xiaohua.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of requirements
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Ignoring a requirement
Solution:
If He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. 
From the requirements, we know that Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected with Guo Yanran or Qiu Zhijie. 
Also, Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected at the same time. 
Therefore, the only person who cannot be selected is Tang Xiaohua.
