Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the celebrity had to choose between two bad options. 
Option A is the only option that must be true based on the information given in the stem. 
Option B is contradicted by the fact that the stem presents the celebrity as being in an awkward situation due to the gossip news. 
Option C is a possible strategy but not necessarily the best one. 
Option D is not mentioned in the stem.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation
 - Overgeneralization
Solution:
The stem presents two options for the celebrity: stay silent and let the rumors spread or come forward and attract more attention. 
Neither option is ideal, but the celebrity must choose one. 
Option A must be true based on the information given in the stem. 
Option B is contradicted by the fact that the stem presents the celebrity as being in an awkward situation due to the gossip news. 
Option C is a possible strategy but not necessarily the best one. 
Option D is not mentioned in the stem.
