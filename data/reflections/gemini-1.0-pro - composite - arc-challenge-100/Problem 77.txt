Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the new predator would target the larger and stronger sheep with dark wool. However, the question states that the sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years. This suggests that the sheep with light wool have a survival advantage, possibly due to their agility or camouflage.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of data
 - Ignoring relevant information
 - Jumping to conclusions
Solution:
The new predator will likely target the sheep that are easier to catch.
The sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years, suggesting they have a survival advantage.
Therefore, the new predator is more likely to target the sheep with dark wool, leading to a decrease in their population.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the question, including all provided information.
2. Identify the key factors influencing the sheep population, such as predator introduction and wool color.
3. Analyze the historical trends in sheep population changes based on wool color.
4. Consider the predator's likely prey selection based on ease of capture.
5. Determine the population group most likely to be targeted by the predator, considering their survival advantage and ease of capture.
6. Choose the answer that reflects the most likely population change based on your analysis.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to all details and data provided in the question.
 - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
 - Consider all relevant factors and their potential impact on the situation.
 - Analyze historical trends and patterns to identify potential influences.
 - Base your conclusions on logical reasoning and evidence-based analysis.
