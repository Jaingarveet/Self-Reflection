Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the question was asking for a single answer when it was actually asking for all possible answers. 
I also failed to consider the specific context of the question, which was about the formation of valleys and canyons.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of question
 - Incomplete answer
 - Lack of context
Solution:
Glaciers, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] can all form valleys and canyons.
Glaciers are large masses of ice that move slowly over the land, eroding the surface and creating valleys.
Rivers are bodies of water that flow over the land, eroding the surface and creating valleys.
Wind is a powerful force that can erode the surface of the land, creating valleys and canyons.
Tides are the regular rise and fall of the ocean's surface, which can erode the coastline and create valleys and canyons.
