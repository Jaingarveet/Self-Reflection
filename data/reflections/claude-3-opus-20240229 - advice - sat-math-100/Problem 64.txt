Advice:
 - Always simplify expressions as much as possible to reveal potential connections.
 - Look for ways to relate the expression you're trying to evaluate to the given information.
 - Don't assume you can't solve a problem just because there are multiple unknowns. Sometimes the solution doesn't require finding the values of all the unknowns.
 - If an expression in the question matches part of a given equation, consider substituting the corresponding value from the equation.
