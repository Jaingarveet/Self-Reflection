Advice:
 - Always keep the properties of exponents in mind, especially when dealing with fractional exponents.
 - Remember that $a^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = (a^{\frac{1}{n}})^m$, not $(a^m)^{\frac{1}{n}}$.
 - Always simplify expressions step by step, following the correct order of operations.
 - If you're unsure about a property or rule, take a moment to verify it before proceeding.
 - Double-check your work to catch any errors in your calculations or reasoning.
