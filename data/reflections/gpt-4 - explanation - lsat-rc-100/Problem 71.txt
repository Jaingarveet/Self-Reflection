Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the author's argument in passage [REDACTED]. I focused on the criticism of the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by the desire to propagate one's genes, but I overlooked the author's point that to decisively explain a behavior, it must be reasonable only if one had that interest.
