Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the question. I focused on the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, which argues against using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures. However, the question asked for what would be objectionable to the proponents of the version discussed in the third paragraph, not its critics.
