Advice:
 - Always consider all the options given, not just the most obvious ones.
 - Think about the broader context and purpose of the procedure or concept in question.
 - Don't make assumptions based on limited information or narrow focus.
 - If unsure, reason through each option systematically before choosing an answer.
 - Be aware of common associations (e.g., liver shrinkage and bariatric surgery) that may be relevant.
