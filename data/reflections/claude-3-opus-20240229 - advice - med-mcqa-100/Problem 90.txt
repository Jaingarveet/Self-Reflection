Advice:
- Always consider the clinical context when answering questions, including patient history and gestational age.
- Prioritize the most likely diagnoses or causes based on the given scenario.
- Don't assume all options are equally probable; use your clinical judgment to discriminate between choices.
- Brush up on your knowledge of obstetric conditions and their impact on fetal position and stability.
- Eliminate options that are less likely, even if they can potentially contribute to the clinical finding.
- Focus on the most probable cause among the given choices, rather than trying to find a choice that fits all possible causes.
