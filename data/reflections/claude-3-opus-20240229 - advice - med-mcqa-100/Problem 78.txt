Advice:
 - Always trace arteries from their origin to their terminal branches.
 - Be aware of anastomoses between terminal branches of arteries from different origins.
 - Consider the full course and relations of an artery, not just its proximal segments.
 - Know the branches and supply of the major arteries of the head (carotid, maxillary, ophthalmic).
 - Use the anatomical location and course of an artery to reason out its relations and anastomoses.
