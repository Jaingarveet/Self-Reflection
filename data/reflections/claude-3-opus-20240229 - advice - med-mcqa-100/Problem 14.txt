Advice:
 - Always consider the specific conditions (aerobic vs anaerobic) when analyzing metabolic pathways.
 - Remember that in anaerobic conditions, NAD+ must be regenerated to allow glycolysis to continue.
 - Understand the coupling of NADH oxidation and pyruvate reduction in anaerobic glycolysis.
 - Be aware of the differences in end products between aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the metabolic pathway and the specific conditions.
