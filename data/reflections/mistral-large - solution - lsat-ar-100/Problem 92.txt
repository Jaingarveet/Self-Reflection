Solution:
From the conditions given, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
We also know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same sales zone as each other.
Since there are only seven sales representatives and there are more of them working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least three representatives.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. However, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 1.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot work in Zone 1 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. However, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, they must work in Zone 3.

If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot work in Zone 2 because they work in the same zone as each other. Therefore, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3. However, since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, they must work in Zone 3.

In any case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as [REDACTED].
