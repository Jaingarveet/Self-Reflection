Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions given:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Now let's evaluate each choice:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice satisfies all conditions.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 2 (Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2) and condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates condition 5 (There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2).
