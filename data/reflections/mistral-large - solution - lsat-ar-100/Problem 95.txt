Solution:
From the given information, we know that the bay holding textiles has a lower number than the bay holding livestock, which in turn has a lower number than the bay holding grain. Therefore, textiles cannot be in bay 3, and grain cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
We also know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so fuel cannot be in bay 3.
Finally, we know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be in bay 1.
Based on this information, we can eliminate choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], since they all have textiles in bay 3 or livestock in bay 2, which contradicts the information given in the question.
Therefore, the only remaining choice is [REDACTED].
