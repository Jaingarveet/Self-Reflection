Solution:
If M is the only chemist selected, then both P and R must be selected (since the rule states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected).
Since at least one scientist of each type must be selected, at least one botanist must be selected.
However, since more than one botanist can be selected if only one zoologist is selected, as long as there is at least one scientist of each type, more than one botanist can be selected.
Therefore, the panel must consist of M (chemist), at least one botanist, and P, Q, and R (zoologists).
