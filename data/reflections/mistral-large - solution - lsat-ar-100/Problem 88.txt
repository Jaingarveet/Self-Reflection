Solution:
We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and at least two books are placed on each shelf. Since I is placed on the middle shelf, we can assume that there are at least two books on the middle shelf.
If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then K and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the top shelf.
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and I is already on the middle shelf, F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, they must be placed on the bottom shelf.
Now we have:
Top shelf: K, O
Middle shelf: I
Bottom shelf: F, M
We still need to place G and H, and we know that there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, G and H cannot both be placed on the top shelf.
If [REDACTED] is true, then [REDACTED] Since I is already on the middle shelf, M must also be placed on the middle shelf. This means that F cannot be placed on the middle shelf, so it must be placed on the bottom shelf. Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, M must also be placed on the bottom shelf. This means that there are now three books on the bottom shelf (F, M, and either G or H), which satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
