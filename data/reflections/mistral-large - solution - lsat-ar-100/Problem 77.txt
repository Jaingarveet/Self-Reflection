Solution:
Let's analyze the rules given:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

From rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).

Now, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).

However, we must also consider rule 2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. Since Robertson can only occupy one of the [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces, and Young and Togowa must occupy [REDACTED] of the remaining [REDACTED] lower-numbered spaces, Souza can only be assigned the remaining lower-numbered space (#1, #2, or #3). This means that Xu can only be assigned one of the [REDACTED] remaining higher-numbered spaces (#5 or #6).
