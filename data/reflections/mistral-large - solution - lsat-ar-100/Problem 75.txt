Solution:
Since Kramer and [REDACTED] each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.
Since neither [REDACTED] nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review only one play, which cannot be Tamerlane since Kramer and [REDACTED] both review it. Therefore, Jiang must review only Sunset.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and [REDACTED] both review Tamerlane, [REDACTED] must review only one play, which cannot be Tamerlane or Sunset. Therefore, [REDACTED] must review only Undulation.
The only student who could review only Sunset is [REDACTED].
