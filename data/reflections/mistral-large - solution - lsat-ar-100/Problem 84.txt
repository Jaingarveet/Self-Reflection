Solution:
More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.
F and M are placed on the same shelf, so they cannot be the only books on the bottom shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so F can be on the bottom shelf if there is at least one other book between them.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is [REDACTED].
