Solution:
Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.
Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Rebecca must also lead a morning session.
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
If Olivia's session meets on Friday morning, then Julio's session must meet on Wednesday or Thursday morning. However, since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and they both lead morning sessions, there is no available morning session for Olivia to lead on Wednesday or Thursday. Therefore, Olivia cannot lead a session on Friday morning.
However, if Lan's session meets Wednesday morning, then Julio's session can meet on Thursday morning, Kevin's session can meet on Friday morning, Rebecca's session can meet on Friday morning, Nessa's session can meet on Thursday afternoon, and Olivia's session can meet on Friday afternoon. Therefore, Lan can lead a session on Wednesday morning.
