Solution:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7.
One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or 7, but not the same space as the pharmacy.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 1 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 2, and it cannot be in space 7 if the optometrist or veterinarian is not in space 6.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so they cannot be in adjacent spaces.

Let's evaluate each choice again:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
