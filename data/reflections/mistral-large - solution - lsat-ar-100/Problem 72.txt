The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants must be at the other end.

If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian.
Since the pharmacy is at one end of the row, the restaurant at the other end of the row cannot be next to the optometrist and shoe store pair.
Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be [REDACTED].
