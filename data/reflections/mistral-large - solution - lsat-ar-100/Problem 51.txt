Solution:
Reynaldo cannot test F, so choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] can be eliminated.
Yuki cannot test J, so choice [REDACTED] can be eliminated.
Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so choice [REDACTED] can be eliminated.
The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Since Yuki cannot test J, she must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
If Yuki tests F on the first day, Seamus must test F on the second day.
If Yuki tests G on the first day, Seamus must test G on the second day.
If Yuki tests H on the first day, Seamus must test H on the second day.
However, since Theresa must test H, Seamus cannot test H on the second day.
Therefore, Yuki must test F on the first day and Seamus must test F on the second day.
This leaves G for Reynaldo and H for Theresa on the first day.
On the second day, Reynaldo must test J and Theresa must test G.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED].
