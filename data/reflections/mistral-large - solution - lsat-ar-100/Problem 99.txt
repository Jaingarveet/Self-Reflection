Solution:
If O is performed immediately after T, then T cannot be performed immediately before F (since O is not performed immediately before F), so T must be performed immediately after R.
Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and T is performed immediately after R, F cannot be performed immediately before R or immediately after R. Therefore, F must be performed before T and R.
Since O is performed either first or fifth, and O is performed immediately after T, T cannot be performed first, so T must be performed fourth. Therefore, O is performed fifth.
Since at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, and O is performed fifth, S cannot be performed sixth. Therefore, S must be performed after O.
Since P is performed at some time before S, and O is performed fifth, P must be performed before O.
Therefore, F must be performed either first, second, or sixth.
