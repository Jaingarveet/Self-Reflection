Solution:
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
The bay holding livestock cannot be [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] because it has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, and the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
The bay holding livestock cannot be [REDACTED] because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
The bay holding livestock cannot be [REDACTED] because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
The only remaining option is bay 4, but it is not listed in the choices.
Therefore, the question is flawed, and there is no correct answer.
