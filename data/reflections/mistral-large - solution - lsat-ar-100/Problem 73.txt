Solution:
We know that exactly three of the students review Undulation.
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must be one of the three students who review Undulation.
Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, they cannot both review Undulation as well, since they each review fewer plays than Megregian.
However, Megregian could review all three plays, so it is possible that Megregian reviews Undulation.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, O'Neill must review Sunset as well.
