Solution:
Theresa must test H at some point, but she tests G on the second day, so she must test H on the first day.
Since Yuki cannot test J, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, Yuki must test F on the first day, and Seamus must test F on the second day.
This leaves Reynaldo to test J on the first day and H on the second day.
However, since Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo cannot test H on the second day.
Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day.
