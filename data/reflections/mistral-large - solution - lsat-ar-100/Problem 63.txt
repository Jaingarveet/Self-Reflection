Solution:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead a session on Friday. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they can lead either the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions or the Thursday morning and afternoon sessions.
Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, so Lan must lead the Wednesday evening session.
Therefore, we can determine the sessions for Julio, Olivia, and Lan.
