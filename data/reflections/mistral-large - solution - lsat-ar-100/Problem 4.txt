Solution:
Since Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, he must lead a session on Thursday or Friday.
However, since Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, [REDACTED] must lead a session on Wednesday.
This means that [REDACTED] must lead a session on Monday or Tuesday, since his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s.
Since [REDACTED] must lead an afternoon session, she cannot lead a session on Wednesday morning, which means that either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] must lead that session.
Since [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they cannot both lead sessions on Wednesday.
Therefore, one of them must lead a session on Thursday.
Since Lan must lead a session on Thursday or Friday, and he cannot lead a session on the same day as [REDACTED], he must lead a session on Thursday.
However, since [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and [REDACTED] cannot lead a session on Wednesday since [REDACTED] must lead an afternoon session on that day, [REDACTED] must lead a session on Thursday.
Therefore, the lab assistant who must lead a Thursday session is [REDACTED].
