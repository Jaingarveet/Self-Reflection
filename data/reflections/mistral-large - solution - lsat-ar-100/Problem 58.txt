Solution:
The bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], so [REDACTED] cannot be in bay 1, 2, or 3.
The bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], so [REDACTED] cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
The bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so [REDACTED] cannot be in bay 1, 2, or 3.
The bay holding [REDACTED] is next to the bay holding [REDACTED], so [REDACTED] cannot be in bay 1 or 6.
Therefore, the only possible options for bay 4 are [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED].
However, since the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], and the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], the bay holding [REDACTED] must be in bay 5 or 6.
Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be in bay 4.
