Solution:
Since Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day, and Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Franco and Garcia must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.
Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, and Franco and Hong must testify on the same day, Franco and Hong must be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
Therefore, Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday.
