Solution:
If J is third, then the first two articles cannot be finance articles, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, the first two articles must be either nutrition or wildlife articles.
If S is earlier than Q, then S cannot be first, as S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third. Therefore, S must be second.
If [REDACTED], then the first article must be a nutrition article, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, Q must be first.
If [REDACTED], then the fourth article cannot be a nutrition article, as consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, G cannot be fourth.
If J is earlier than G, and G is earlier than R, then R cannot be earlier than J. Therefore, R cannot be fifth.
If S is earlier than Y, then Y cannot be earlier than S. However, Y can still be fifth, as there is no condition that prevents it from being so.
