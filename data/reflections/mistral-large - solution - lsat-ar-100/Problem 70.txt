Solution:
The conditions given are:
1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
2. [REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. [REDACTED] must be shorter than [REDACTED].
4. Solide's voicemail target is shorter than [REDACTED].
From condition 4, we know that Solide's voicemail target is shorter than [REDACTED].
Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, [REDACTED] must also be shorter than [REDACTED].
Therefore, [REDACTED] must be 2 days.
