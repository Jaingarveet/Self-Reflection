Solution:
Let's analyze the constraints given in the question:

1. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
2. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
3. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
4. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Now let's evaluate each choice:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates constraint 4, as Julio's session is on the same day as Olivia's.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates constraint 4, as Olivia's session is on an earlier day than Julio's.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates constraint 2, as Lan and Olivia are leading sessions on the same day.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice violates constraint 4, as Julio's session is on the same day as Olivia's.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice satisfies all the constraints.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
