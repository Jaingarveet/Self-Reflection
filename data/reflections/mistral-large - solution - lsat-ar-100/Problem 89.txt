Solution:
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, as there must be at least one batch made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they cannot both be made on Tuesday.
Since only one batch is made on Friday, it cannot be the same kind of cookie as the ones made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday.
The first batch of sugar cookies can be made on Monday, as it does not violate any of the given conditions.
