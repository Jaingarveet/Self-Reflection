Solution:
The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
According to the conditions, none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Therefore, if one client has [REDACTED], the other clients cannot have [REDACTED] because their voicemail targets would have to be longer than 3 days, which is not possible.
