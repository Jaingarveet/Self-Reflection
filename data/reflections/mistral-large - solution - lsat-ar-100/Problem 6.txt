Solution:
From the given conditions, we can deduce that:

* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review all three plays.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang could review zero plays or one play that is not Tamerlane.
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they each review at least one play.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other. Since Megregian reviews all three plays, this means that either Kramer or O'Neill must also review all three plays.

From these deductions, we can see that:

* Jiang could review zero plays, so [REDACTED] might not be true.
* Megregian reviews all three plays, so [REDACTED] must be true.
* O'Neill reviews at least one play, but we don't know if he reviews more than one, so we can't determine if [REDACTED] is true.
* We don't know how many plays O'Neill reviews, so we can't determine if [REDACTED] is true.
* Kramer reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so [REDACTED] must be true.
