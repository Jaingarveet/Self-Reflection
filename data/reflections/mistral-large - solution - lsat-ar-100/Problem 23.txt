Solution:
Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, George must give the morning report on Tuesday since Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
Since Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday because if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Therefore, Nina cannot be the morning report on Monday.
Since Robert cannot give an afternoon report, he must give a morning report.
Since Irving must give a report on the day after Nina's report, and Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, Irving must give a report on Wednesday.
Therefore, the list of the students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be [REDACTED].
