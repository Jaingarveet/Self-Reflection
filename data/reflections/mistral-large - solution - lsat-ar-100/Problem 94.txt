Solution:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it can only be in space 1 or space 7.
Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be next to it, so it must be in space 1.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 2 and 3, or spaces 6 and 7.
Since the pharmacy is in space 1, the only possible spaces for the restaurants are spaces 3 and 7, or spaces 4 and 6.
Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the only possible spaces for the restaurants are spaces 2 and 6, or spaces 3 and 7.
However, since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
Therefore, the only possible space for the toy store is space 3, and the only possible space for one of the restaurants is space 4.
