Solution:
The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we need to select a botanist, a chemist, and a zoologist.
We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R).
Since more than one botanist is not allowed if more than one zoologist is selected, we cannot select another botanist.
Since F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected, we cannot select [REDACTED].
Since [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected, we cannot select [REDACTED].
Since [REDACTED] is not selected, we do not need to select both [REDACTED] and R.
Therefore, the only remaining option is another zoologist.
