Solution:
Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, they cannot review the play Jiang reviews.
Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review the same play as either Kramer or O'Neill.
Therefore, Megregian must review Tamerlane.
