Solution:
Given that P is performed third and S is performed sixth, we know that O cannot be performed first or fifth because it must be performed either first or fifth, and it cannot be performed first because P is performed third. Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
However, this does not mean that F must be performed fourth or sixth. We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Since O is performed fifth, T cannot be performed immediately before F. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R.
Since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and since T is performed immediately after R, F cannot be performed immediately after R. Therefore, F must be performed immediately before T.
Since P is performed third and S is performed sixth, and since O is performed fifth, the only possible compositions that can be performed fourth are H and L.
