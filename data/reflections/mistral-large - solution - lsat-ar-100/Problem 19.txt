Solution:
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report on the same day.
Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must give the afternoon report on Tuesday.
Since Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, Nina must give the other afternoon report.
Since Nina gives an afternoon report, she cannot give a report on Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, she must give her report on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.
If Nina gives her report on Monday afternoon, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. However, this is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Tuesday afternoon.
Since Nina gives a report on Tuesday afternoon, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Since Helen gives a morning report, she must give her report on Wednesday morning.
Since Irving must give a report on Wednesday and cannot give an afternoon report, he must give the morning report on Wednesday.
Since Kyle gives a morning report and cannot give a report on Tuesday (since both morning and afternoon reports are taken), he must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
Since Lenore gives a morning report and cannot give a report on Tuesday (since both morning and afternoon reports are taken), she must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
Since Helen gives a report on Wednesday morning, neither Kyle nor Lenore can give a report on Wednesday morning. Therefore, they must both give reports on Monday morning.
Since George gives a report on Tuesday afternoon, neither Kyle nor Lenore can give a report on Tuesday morning. Therefore, they must both give reports on Monday morning.
Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report on the same day. Therefore, Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday.
