Solution:
Since Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in the same sales zone.
Since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Zone 3 must have at least 2 sales representatives, and Zone 2 must have at most 2 sales representatives.
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Parra and Quinn must both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 3.
If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must all work in Zone 1.
Therefore, Kim could work in Zone 2.
