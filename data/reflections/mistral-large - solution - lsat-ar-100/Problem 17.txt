Solution:
Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, they cannot be featured on any other day.
Since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7, they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Since Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, they can only be featured on days 1, 3, and 5.
However, since any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 1.
Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on days 3 and 5.
Since Manx and Siamese kittens cannot be featured on consecutive days, and Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6, Manx and Siamese kittens must be featured on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.
Therefore, the only pair of days that cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy is [REDACTED], since they feature different breeds of kittens.
