Solution:
The constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships means that they cannot be assigned to the same ambassadorship.
The constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne means that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to a different ambassadorship.
The constraint that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen means that if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
The constraint that if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia means that Landon can only be assigned to Zambia.
The only option that cannot be true is that Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia because if Novetzke is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship, which violates the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
