Solution:
We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books. Since at least two books are placed on each shelf, the top shelf must have exactly 2 books.
We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must have at least 2 books as well.
Since L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, L cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, L must be on the top shelf.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf as well.
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, they cannot be on the top shelf because it already has two books (L and O). Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf with I.
Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf.
Therefore, the top shelf has L, O, and K; the middle shelf has I, F, and M; and the bottom shelf has G and H.
Since H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
