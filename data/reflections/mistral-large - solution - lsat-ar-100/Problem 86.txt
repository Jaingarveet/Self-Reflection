Solution:
The bay holding produce is bay 4.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so it must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding grain must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
In either case, the bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 6.
Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding (produce) is completely determined, the type of cargo that either bay 3 or bay 5 is holding (textiles) is also completely determined, and the type of cargo that either bay 2 or bay 3 is holding (livestock) is also completely determined.
