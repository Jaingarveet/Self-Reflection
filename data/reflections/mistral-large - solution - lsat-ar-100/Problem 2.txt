Solution:
The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Option [REDACTED] states that no more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, this constraint effectively separates the two restaurants by at least two other businesses.
