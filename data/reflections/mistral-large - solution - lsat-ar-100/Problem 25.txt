Solution:
If G is fourth, then J must be earlier than G, so J can be first, second, or third.
If J is first, then the second article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the second article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the second article cannot be Y. Therefore, the second article must be Q.
If J is second, then the first article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the first article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the first article cannot be Y. Therefore, the first article must be Q.
If J is third, then the first and second articles cannot be about finance, so they must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the first and second articles cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Y, the first and second articles cannot be Y. Therefore, the first and second articles must be Q and S, in that order.
In all cases, the fifth article cannot be about finance, so it must be either Q, R, or Y. But since G is fourth, the fifth article cannot be R, and since S must be earlier than Q, the fifth article cannot be Q. Therefore, the fifth article must be Y.
