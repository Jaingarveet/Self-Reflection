Solution:
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, they cannot be in Zone 2 because Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, they cannot be in Zone 1 because Parra cannot work in Zone 1.
Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 2, they must be in Zone 3.
Since Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 1, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, they must also be in Zone 3.
Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
