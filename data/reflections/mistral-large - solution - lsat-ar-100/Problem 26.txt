Solution:
The third solo is a traditional piece, but it is not specified which pianist performs it.
The [REDACTED]th solo can be a traditional piece performed by Wayne or a modern piece performed by Zara.
Since no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least [REDACTED] modern piece, Wayne must perform a modern piece before performing a traditional piece.
However, it is possible that Wayne does not perform any traditional pieces at all.
If Zara performs the third solo as a traditional piece, Wayne can perform the first and second solos as modern pieces.
If Wayne performs the [REDACTED]th solo as a modern piece, Zara can perform the fifth solo as a traditional piece.
Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is [REDACTED].
