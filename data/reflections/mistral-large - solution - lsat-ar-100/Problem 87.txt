Solution:
The organizer must select at least three novels, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
Therefore, the organizer must select at least [REDACTED] to meet the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
The organizer can select at most four French works, and if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Therefore, the organizer cannot select both French plays.
The organizer must select at least five works, so if only [REDACTED] are selected, then at least one Russian novel must be selected.
