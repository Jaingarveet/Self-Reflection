Solution:
From the given conditions, we know that:
1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
From condition 3, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
From condition 4, we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
However, this condition does not mean that only two students can review the same play. It means that two students can review the same set of plays.
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all conditions is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
