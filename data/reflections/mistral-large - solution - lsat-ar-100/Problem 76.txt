Solution:
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Therefore, the bay holding livestock cannot be next to the bay holding fuel, as it must be between the bay holding textiles and the bay holding grain.
