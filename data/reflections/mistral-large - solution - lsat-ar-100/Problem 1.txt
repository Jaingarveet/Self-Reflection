Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions given:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Now let's analyze each choice:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible, as it does not violate any conditions.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This cannot be true, as Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia, who must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible, as it does not violate any conditions.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This cannot be true, as exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, not Wednesday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is possible, as it does not violate any conditions.
