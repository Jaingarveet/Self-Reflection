Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the new ratio of boys to girls.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem but in correctly interpreting the given information.
I knew the correct initial ratio and the correct new ratio but misinterpreted the information about the same number of boys and girls joining the group.

Error Keywords:
 - Ratio interpretation error
 - Misinterpretation of given information
 - Calculation error

Solution:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the number of boys who joined is x and the number of girls who joined is also x.
The new number of boys is 64 + x and the new number of girls is 40 + x.
The new ratio can be written as (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.
Solving for x, we get x = 24.
So, 24 boys and 24 girls joined the group.
The total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 24 + 24 = [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the initial ratio of boys to girls.
2. Identify the new ratio of boys to girls.
3. Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.
4. Write an equation for the new ratio in terms of x.
5. Solve for x.
6. Calculate the new number of boys and girls.
7. Calculate the total number of members now.
8. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
