Explanation:
I made an algebraic error in my equation setup.
The gap in my knowledge was in algebra, specifically in setting up the correct equation to represent the problem.
I incorrectly set up the equation as 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4, when it should have been 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4(x-4)/x.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Equation setup error
 - Incorrect equation
Solution:
Let x be the number of people who attended the picnic.
The original cost per person was 96/x.
The new cost per person was 96/(x-4).
The difference in cost per person was 4.
The equation to represent this is 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4(x-4)/x.
Solving this equation for x gives x = [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the total cost of the picnic.
2. Identify the extra cost per person.
3. Let x be the number of people who attended the picnic.
4. Set up an equation to represent the original cost per person.
5. Set up an equation to represent the new cost per person.
6. Set up an equation to represent the difference in cost per person.
7. Solve the equation for x.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to set up the correct equation to represent the problem.
 - Be careful with algebraic manipulations and simplifications.
 - Always check your answer against the given choices.
