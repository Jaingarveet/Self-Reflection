Solution:
Given that the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be in space 6 because it must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. However, since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and one restaurant must be at the end of the row, a restaurant must be in space 7. This means the pharmacy must be in space 1. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4 to maintain the required separation.
