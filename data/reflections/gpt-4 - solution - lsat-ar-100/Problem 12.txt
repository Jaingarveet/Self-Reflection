Solution:
The rules state that J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning. This means that J and K cannot be shown consecutively because there are only two slots in the evening and K cannot occupy the morning slot before it. Therefore, the pair of houses that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is J and K.
