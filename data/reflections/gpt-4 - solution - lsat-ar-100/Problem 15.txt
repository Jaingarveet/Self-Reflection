Solution:
Given the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. If the shoe store is in space 4, the pharmacy cannot be in space 3 because it would not be at the end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 5 or 6. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
