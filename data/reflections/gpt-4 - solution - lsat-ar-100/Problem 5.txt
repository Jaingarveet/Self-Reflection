Solution:
From the conditions, we know that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, and O is higher than L. F and M are on the same shelf. Since K is higher than F, and F is with M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, K must be on the middle or top shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the top shelf can have at most 3 books. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf because if they were on the top shelf, K would have to be on the middle shelf, and there would be 4 books on the top shelf, which is not allowed. Since F and M are on the bottom shelf, and O is higher than L, O must be on a shelf higher than M.
