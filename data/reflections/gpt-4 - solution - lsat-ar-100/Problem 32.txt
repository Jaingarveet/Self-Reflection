Solution:
Given that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, the voicemail targets must be either 1 or 2 days. Since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day. Therefore, Solide's and Truvest's voicemail targets must be 2 days. 
Since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's website target must also be 1 day. 
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Given that Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, Solide's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
