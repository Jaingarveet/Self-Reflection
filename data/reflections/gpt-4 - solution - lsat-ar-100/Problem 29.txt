Solution:
Given that L is placed on a shelf higher than H, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, K cannot be on the bottom shelf. However, K could be on the middle shelf, and F and M could be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, H must be on the bottom shelf with F and M, making the correct answer [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
