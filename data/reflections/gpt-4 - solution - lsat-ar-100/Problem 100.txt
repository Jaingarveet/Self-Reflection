Solution:
Let's go through the conditions one by one and see which option satisfies all of them.
1. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. 
3. O is performed either first or fifth. 
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. 
5. P is performed at some time before S. 
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Option [REDACTED]: Satisfies all conditions.
Option [REDACTED]: Fails condition 2, there are not at least two compositions between F and R.
Option [REDACTED]: Fails condition 3, O is not first or fifth.
Option [REDACTED]: Fails condition 4, H is not the eighth composition.
Option [REDACTED]: Fails condition 1, T is not immediately before F or after R.
