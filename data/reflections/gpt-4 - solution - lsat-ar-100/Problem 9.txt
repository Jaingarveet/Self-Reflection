Solution:
Given the rules, Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa and Souza, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Young could be assigned parking space #2 if Togowa and Souza are assigned parking spaces #1. Robertson could be assigned parking space #3 if Young is assigned parking space #2 and Togowa and Souza are assigned parking spaces #1. Therefore, Togowa could be assigned parking space #1.
