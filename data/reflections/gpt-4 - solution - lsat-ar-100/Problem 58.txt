Solution:
Given the constraints:
1. Grain > Livestock
2. Livestock > Textiles
3. Produce > Fuel
4. Textiles is next to Produce
We can infer that:
- Grain must be in a bay with a higher number than both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], so it cannot be in bay 4.
- Livestock must be in a bay with a higher number than [REDACTED], but it could be in bay 4 if [REDACTED] is in bay 3.
- Textiles could be in bay 4 if [REDACTED] is in bay 5.
- Produce could be in bay 4 if fuel is in a lower-numbered bay.
- There are no constraints on [REDACTED], so it could be in any bay.
Therefore, the only cargo that cannot be in bay 4 is [REDACTED].
