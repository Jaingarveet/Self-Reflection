Solution:
The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means that [REDACTED] can only be set for a client if its voicemail target is also 3 days. However, since there are only three possible targets (1 day, 2 days, and 3 days), [REDACTED] would mean that the website target would also have to be 3 days. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be set for more than one client. The correct answer is [REDACTED].
