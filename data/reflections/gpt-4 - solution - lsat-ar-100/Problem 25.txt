Solution:
Given that G is fourth, we know that J must be earlier than G, so J could be first, second, or third. H cannot be fifth because consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, and G and H both cover finance. Q cannot be second because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S cannot be fifth because G is fourth and S and G cover different topics, so they cannot be consecutive. However, Y can be sixth because the condition is that S must be earlier than Y, not immediately before Y. Therefore, Y being sixth could be true.
