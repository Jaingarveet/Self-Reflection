Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that there must be at least one day where two batches of cookies are made. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, this means that there must be at least one day before Thursday where two batches of cookies are made. Therefore, it is not possible for only one batch of cookies to be made on Friday, making statement [REDACTED] the correct answer.
