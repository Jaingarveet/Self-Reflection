Solution:
Given that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, it means that T is performed immediately before F. This satisfies the first condition. 
Since T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, there are four compositions before T and F, and two compositions after them. This satisfies the second condition. 
O cannot be performed fifth because T is performed fifth, so O must be performed first. This satisfies the third condition. 
The eighth composition can be either L or H, this doesn't affect S's position. 
P is performed at some time before S, so S cannot be performed first, second, or third because P must be performed before it and O is already performed first. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed first, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. So, S cannot be performed second. 
Therefore, S must be performed either [REDACTED].
