Solution:
Given that G is on the top shelf, and K must be on a higher shelf than F, K must also be on the top shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf and cannot be on the top shelf (because K is higher), they must be on the middle or bottom shelf. However, since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and we already have two books (G and K) on the top shelf, F and M must be on the bottom shelf to allow for at least three books there. This leaves [REDACTED], L, and O for the middle shelf. But since O must be on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the middle shelf with I, and L must be on the bottom shelf with F and M. This leaves H for the top shelf with G and K.
