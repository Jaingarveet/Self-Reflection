Solution:
Given that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and O is performed immediately after T, then T cannot be performed immediately before F because O would have to be performed immediately after F, which is not possible. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R. This means that F must be performed after O and T. Since O is performed either first or fifth, and T is performed immediately after O, then F must be performed either third or seventh. However, since at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, F cannot be performed third. Therefore, F must be performed [REDACTED].
