Solution:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia cannot lead a session on Thursday because Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. So, Olivia must lead a session on Friday. 
Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, and the Friday afternoon session is the only [REDACTED] left, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session. 
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, and the only day with [REDACTED] sessions left is Wednesday, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions. 
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan cannot lead a session on Friday. The only session left for Lan is Thursday morning. 
So, we can determine the sessions for [REDACTED] of the other lab assistants: Olivia, Nessa, Kevin, Rebecca, and Lan. However, excluding Julio, we can determine the sessions for only [REDACTED] other lab assistants.
