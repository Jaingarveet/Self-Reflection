Solution:
The conditions state that Reynaldo cannot test F, Yuki cannot test J, Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the first day because if she did, Seamus would have to test H on the second day, which would mean Theresa wouldn't be able to test H at all. So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
