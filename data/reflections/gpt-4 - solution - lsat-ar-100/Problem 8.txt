Solution:
Given the rules, the bay holding livestock must be higher than the bay holding textiles and lower than the bay holding grain. Also, the bay holding textiles must be next to the bay holding produce. This means that the bay holding livestock cannot be [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]. It also cannot be [REDACTED], because then the bay holding textiles would have to be [REDACTED], and there would be no lower-numbered bay for the bay holding produce. Therefore, the bay holding livestock could be [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]. However, if the bay holding livestock were [REDACTED], the bay holding textiles would have to be [REDACTED], and there would be no lower-numbered bay for the bay holding produce. Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be [REDACTED].
