Solution:
Given the constraints, we know that:
- Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
- If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
- If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
From these constraints, we can deduce that:
- Landon is the only candidate who can be assigned to Zambia.
Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is:
- [REDACTED] Because Landon is the only candidate who can be assigned to Zambia.
