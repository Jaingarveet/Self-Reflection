Solution:
Given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3, and the rules state that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, it means that Young and Togowa must be assigned parking spaces #1 or #2. However, since Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1. Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #2.
