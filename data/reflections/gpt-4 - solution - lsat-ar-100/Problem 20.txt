2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only report in the morning.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is possible. Olivia gives a report on Monday morning, Robert gives a report on Tuesday morning, and Irving gives a report on Wednesday morning.
