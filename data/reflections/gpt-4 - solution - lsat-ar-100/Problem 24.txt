Solution:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned. This means that if Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must be assigned, but not vice versa. The only choice that maintains this one-way relationship and does not allow both Jaramillo and Kayne to be assigned is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This choice ensures that if Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne cannot be assigned because Novetzke must be assigned.
