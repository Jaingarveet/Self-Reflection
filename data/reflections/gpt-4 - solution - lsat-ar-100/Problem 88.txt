Solution:
The conditions state that I is on the middle shelf, K is higher than F, O is higher than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. 
If we look at the choices:
[REDACTED]: I and M are on the same shelf. This would mean that F is also on the middle shelf (since F and M are on the same shelf). Since K is higher than F, K must be on the top shelf. Since O is higher than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf. This leaves G and H for the bottom shelf, which satisfies the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the placement of all the books is determined.
