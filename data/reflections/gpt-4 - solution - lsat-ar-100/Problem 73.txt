Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. This means Jiang must review Undulation and/or Sunset. Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, it's possible that Megregian reviews all three plays, including Undulation. However, the conditions do not specify that Megregian must review Undulation. Therefore, it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset, making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.
