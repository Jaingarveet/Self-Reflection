Solution:
The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. We already have a botanist (F), a chemist (L), and two zoologists (Q and R). We need another scientist, but it can't be [REDACTED] (because F is already selected) or [REDACTED] (because [REDACTED] requires both [REDACTED] and R to be selected, and R is already selected). So, the fifth scientist must be either [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED]. Since only one botanist is selected, we can have more than one zoologist. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be [REDACTED].
