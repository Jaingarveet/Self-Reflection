Solution:
Given that bay 4 is holding produce, and the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, then fuel must be in one of the bays numbered 1, 2, or 3. 
The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5. However, since the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, textiles cannot be in bay 5. Therefore, textiles must be in bay 3.
Since textiles are in bay 3, livestock must be in bay 5. 
The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain must be in bay 6. 
So, the cargo for bays 3 (textiles), 4 (produce), 5 (livestock), and 6 (grain) are completely determined.
