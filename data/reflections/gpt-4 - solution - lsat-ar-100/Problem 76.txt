Solution:
Given the conditions, the bay holding grain must be at a higher number than the bay holding livestock, and the bay holding livestock must be at a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce must be at a higher number than the bay holding fuel, and the bay holding textiles must be next to the bay holding produce. 
Given these conditions, the bay holding livestock cannot be next to the bay holding fuel because the bay holding produce (which must be at a higher number than the bay holding fuel) is next to the bay holding textiles (which must be at a lower number than the bay holding livestock). Therefore, the statement that must be false is "[REDACTED]"
