Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same zone. If Quinn and [REDACTED] were in the same zone, that would mean Parra and [REDACTED] are in the same zone, which contradicts the condition that either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as [REDACTED].
