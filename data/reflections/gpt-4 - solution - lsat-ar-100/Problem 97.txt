Solution:
Given that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday. The first batch of sugar cookies can also be made on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, two different kinds of cookies can have their first batch made on Monday (option A) or Tuesday (option B). 
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch must be made on or before Wednesday. This allows for two different kinds of cookies to have their second batch made on Thursday (option D). 
Three batches of each cookie are made each week, so two different kinds of cookies can have their third batch made on Friday (option E). 
However, since the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, it is not possible for two different kinds of cookies to have their second batch made on Wednesday (option C).
