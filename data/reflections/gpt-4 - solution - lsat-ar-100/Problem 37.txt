Solution:
Given that S is performed fourth, and P is performed at some time before S, P must be performed in one of the first three positions. Also, O is performed either first or fifth. Since S is fourth, O must be performed first. Therefore, the first composition must be O, and P must be either second or third. However, considering the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, T cannot be performed third. Therefore, the only option that fits these conditions is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]".
