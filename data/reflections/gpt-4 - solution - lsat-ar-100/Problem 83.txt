Solution:
Given the constraints, if Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then:
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. This means Olivia's session cannot be on Wednesday or Thursday morning, as Julio is leading a morning session and it must be before Olivia's.
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. If Kevin is leading a morning session, Rebecca must lead an afternoon session on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. If Olivia's session is on Friday morning, Lan's session cannot be on Friday afternoon.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session. This can be any day.
Given these constraints, the only option that cannot be true is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]" If Julio and Kevin are both leading morning sessions, they must be on Wednesday and Thursday. If Lan were to lead a session on Wednesday morning, it would conflict with either Julio or Kevin's session.
