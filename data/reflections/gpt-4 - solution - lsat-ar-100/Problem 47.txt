Solution:
Given that Image's website target is 2 days, and considering the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, [REDACTED] can be either 2 days or 1 day. However, since [REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, it must be 1 day. This leaves 2 days as the only possible target for Image's website, so the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
