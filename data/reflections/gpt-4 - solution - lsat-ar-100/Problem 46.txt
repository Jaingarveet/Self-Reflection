Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that:
- Reynaldo cannot test F.
- Yuki cannot test J.
- Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
From these conditions, we can infer that:
- Theresa must test H on either the first or second day. 
- Since each rider tests a different bicycle each day, and all bicycles are tested each day, Theresa cannot test F on the second day because she must test H on one of the days.
