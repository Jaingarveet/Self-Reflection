Solution:
From the conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. So, any option that does not include both Kramer and O'Neill is incorrect, eliminating option [REDACTED]. 
Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Since Jiang is not mentioned as reviewing Tamerlane, this does not eliminate any options. 
Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This does not mean Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. It only means she reviews more plays. So, options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are possible. 
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, this means that no other student can review Tamerlane, eliminating option [REDACTED]. 
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
