Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that:
- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Since Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, George can't give a report because all afternoon slots are taken and he can only report on Tuesday. This means that the morning report on Tuesday must be given by someone other than George. The only option that fits these conditions is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
