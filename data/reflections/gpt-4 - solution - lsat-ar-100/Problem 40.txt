Solution:
Given the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. This means the pharmacy could be in space 1 or space 7. Since the shoe store is in space 2, the pharmacy could be in space 1 if the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 2. Therefore, the optometrist could be in space 5.
