Solution:
The third and [REDACTED]th solos are traditional pieces. The [REDACTED]th solo can be performed by Wayne with a traditional piece or Zara with a modern piece. Since Zara can perform a modern piece in the [REDACTED]th solo, Wayne doesn't necessarily have to perform a traditional piece. The condition that no traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least [REDACTED] modern piece also doesn't require Wayne to perform a traditional piece. Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece could be [REDACTED].
