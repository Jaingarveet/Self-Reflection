Solution:
Given that Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, we can deduce the following:
- Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they must give their reports in the morning. But since the morning slots are already taken by Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, Olivia and Robert cannot give reports.
- George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must take one of the afternoon slots.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. But since Helen is giving a morning report, Nina cannot give a report because there is no next day for both Helen and Irving to give reports.
- This leaves Irving as the only one who can give the afternoon report on Monday.
