Solution:
If both G and H are selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected due to the condition "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected". This does not necessarily exclude M from being selected, as M is a chemist. However, if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which contradicts the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected. The remaining chemists are K and L. The condition "F and K cannot both be selected" does not prevent F from being selected if K is not. Therefore, the panel must include either F or K.
