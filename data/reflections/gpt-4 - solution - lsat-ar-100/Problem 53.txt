Solution:
Given the rules, J must be shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning, and L must be shown after K and before M. This means that K must be shown either in the afternoon or evening, L must be shown after K (so also in the afternoon or evening), and M must be shown after L (so in the evening). However, since J must also be shown in the evening and only two houses can be shown in the evening, one of K, L, or M must be shown in the afternoon. Since K cannot be shown in the morning and L must be shown before M, L must be shown in the afternoon.
