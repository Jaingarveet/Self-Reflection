Solution:
The conditions state that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, meaning there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. However, this does not mean that there cannot be two books on the bottom shelf if there is only one book on the top shelf. Therefore, options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] should not be eliminated based on this condition.
The conditions also state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option [REDACTED] can be eliminated. 
The conditions also state that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option [REDACTED] can be eliminated. 
This leaves options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] as possible answers. However, option [REDACTED] can be eliminated because it includes four books, and there are only three shelves, with at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED].
