Solution:
Given the conditions, if R is fourth, then G and J must be in the first three positions. This is because J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Also, since S must be earlier than Y, and Q can only be third if S is earlier, this fully determines the order of the articles. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
