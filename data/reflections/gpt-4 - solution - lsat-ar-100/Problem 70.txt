Solution:
Given the conditions, [REDACTED] must be the shortest, so it must be 1 day. This means that [REDACTED] can be either 1 or 2 days. [REDACTED] must be shorter than [REDACTED], so if Solide's voicemail target is shorter than [REDACTED], then [REDACTED] can be 1 or 2 days. This means that [REDACTED] can be either 2 or 3 days. [REDACTED] can be either 2 or 3 days, but it must be shorter than its website target, so it can only be 2 days if the website target is 3 days. Therefore, [REDACTED] could be 2 days.
