Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and cannot be featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy cannot be featured on [REDACTED] because Himalayans are featured on three days and cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7, leaving only days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. If Himalayans are featured on day 2, they cannot be featured on day 6 because no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
