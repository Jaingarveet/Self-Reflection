Solution:
Let's analyze the rules again:
1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. This means Young cannot be in space #1 and Togowa cannot be in space #6.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This means Xu cannot be in space #1 and Souza cannot be in space #6.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This means Robertson cannot be in space #6 and Young cannot be in space #1.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This further limits Robertson's options.
From these rules, we can see that Robertson, Young, Togowa, Xu, and Souza all have their parking space options limited. However, Robertson, Young, Togowa, and Souza are limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces. 
Robertson can only be in spaces #3 or #4, because he must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and he must be in spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4. 
Young can only be in spaces #2 or #3, because he cannot be in spaces #1 (due to rule 3) or #6 (due to rule 1), and since Robertson must be in a higher-numbered space, Young can only be in spaces #2 or #3.
Togowa can only be in spaces #1 or #2, because Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, and Young can only be in spaces #2 or #3.
Souza can only be in spaces #1 or #2, because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and Xu can be in any space except #1.
