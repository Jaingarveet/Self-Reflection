Solution:
Given that Iturbe and Jackson are both testifying on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, that leaves only one day, Monday, for the remaining three witnesses: Franco, Garcia, and Hong. Since Hong cannot testify on Monday, either Franco or Garcia must testify on Monday, but not both, because they cannot testify on the same day. Therefore, exactly one witness must testify on Monday.
