Solution:
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only give a report on Tuesday, this means that Nina and Robert must give their reports on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to give reports the next day, Nina cannot give her report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Monday and Robert on Wednesday. This means that Helen can give a report on Wednesday because she can give her report the day after Nina. So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
