Solution:
Given the conditions, Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Parra and Udall cannot be in the same zone. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 2. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that Zone 1 has at least 3 representatives, Zone 2 has 2, and Zone 3 has at least 2 but less than 3, so it also has 2 representatives. The remaining representatives are Kim, Mahr, and Tiao. Since Tiao cannot be in the same zone as Parra, Tiao could be in Zone 3, which makes option [REDACTED]: "Udall works in Zone 3" a possible scenario.
