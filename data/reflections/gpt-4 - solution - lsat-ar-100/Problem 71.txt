Solution:
From the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. 
Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it means that Tiao can work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, but not in both. 
Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they cannot be in Zone 3 as Tiao cannot be with them. 
Therefore, the only sales representatives left to work in Zone 3 are Kim and Mahr. 
So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
