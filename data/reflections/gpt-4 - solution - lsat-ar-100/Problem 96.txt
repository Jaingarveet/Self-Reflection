Solution:
Given the conditions, the Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, 2, or any day with Rottweilers. Since the Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days, they could be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6. Since no breed featured on day 1 can be featured on day 7, the Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, the Himalayans must be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 or days 4, 5, and 6. This means that the Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 (choice C), and the Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 (choice E). This leaves choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. Since the Manx and Siamese can be featured on any day that does not feature the Himalayans, either could be true. However, since the Himalayans are featured on day 6, choice [REDACTED] is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
