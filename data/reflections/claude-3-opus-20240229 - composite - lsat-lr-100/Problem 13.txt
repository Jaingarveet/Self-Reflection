Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that choice [REDACTED] was the correct answer because it seemed to directly address Checkers's motive for refusing the coupons. However, upon further reflection, I realize that choice [REDACTED] is too specific and doesn't necessarily apply to all situations where a company refuses a competitor's coupons.
Error Keywords:
 - Overly specific assumption
 - Misinterpreting the argument's scope
 - Focusing on irrelevant details
 - Not considering the broader implications
Solution:
The economics professor's argument can be broken down as follows:
Premise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.
Premise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.
Premise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.
Conclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw the conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the premises to the conclusion. Choice [REDACTED] provides this connection by stating that any company refusing competitor coupons when doing so would satisfy potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. This assumption allows us to infer Checkers's motive based on the given premises.
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the premises and conclusion.
2. Look for the gap between the premises and the conclusion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one, if assumed, would bridge the gap and enable the conclusion to be properly drawn.
4. Choose the answer that provides the necessary assumption without being too specific or irrelevant to the argument.
5. Double-check that the chosen answer, when combined with the premises, logically leads to the conclusion.
Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and identify the premises and conclusion.
 - Look for the gap between the premises and the conclusion, and focus on finding the assumption that bridges this gap.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that are too specific or irrelevant to the argument's scope.
 - Consider the broader implications of each answer choice and how they relate to the argument as a whole.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure that the chosen answer, when combined with the premises, logically leads to the conclusion.
