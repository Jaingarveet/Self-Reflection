Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the specific detail about squeaky floors rather than the broader point about the prevalence of fear of ninjas among the Japanese population. Tamara's objection was that many wealthy Japanese feared ninjas, as evidenced by the squeaky floors. I tried to counter this by suggesting the floors were ineffective, but this doesn't address the key issue of how widespread the fear was. The correct answer points out that the wealthy were a small portion of the population, so even if they feared ninjas, this doesn't contradict Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not.
Error Keywords:
 - Missed the main point
 - Focused on irrelevant detail 
 - Ignored key information
 - Population size oversight
Solution:
Patricia's main claim is that there was little ninja activity during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time. 
Tamara objects by pointing out that many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed to warn of ninjas, suggesting they did fear ninjas.
However, the wealthy made up only a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period (Choice C). 
So even if the wealthy feared ninjas, this is consistent with Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not.
The prevalence of fear among a small subgroup does not contradict the assertion about the population as a whole.
Instructions:
1. Identify the main claim being made in the argument.
2. Identify the key objection or counterargument being raised.
3. Analyze each answer choice to see if it effectively counters the objection and supports the main claim.
4. Consider how each choice relates to the scope of the claim - does it address the whole population or just a subgroup?
5. Select the choice that best defends the main claim against the objection by providing relevant additional information.
Advice:
 - Always keep the main point of the argument in mind; don't get sidetracked by minor details.
 - Consider the scope of the claim being made - does it apply to all or most of a group, or just to a specific subset?
 - Evaluate how each piece of information relates to and impacts the overall argument.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences that go beyond the given information.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to address the key issue raised in the objection.
