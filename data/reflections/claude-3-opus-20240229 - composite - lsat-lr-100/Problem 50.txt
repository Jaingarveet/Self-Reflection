Explanation:
I selected choice [REDACTED], thinking that if low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, they could end up absorbing as much total nicotine as high-nicotine cigarette smokers. However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]. Choice [REDACTED] directly explains the finding by stating there is a maximum amount of nicotine the blood can absorb in a day, and even low-nicotine cigarettes can reach this limit. I failed to recognize that [REDACTED] provides a full physiological explanation for the observation.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooked key information
 - Incomplete reasoning
 - Flawed assumptions
 - Misinterpreted answer choices
Solution:
The study found that smokers of both low and high-nicotine cigarettes have the same blood nicotine levels after smoking a pack a day. To explain this, we need to find a choice that accounts for why high-nicotine cigarette smokers don't have higher blood nicotine levels.
Choice [REDACTED] states that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than the amount found in a pack of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This means there is a maximum daily limit of nicotine absorption, and even low-nicotine cigarettes reach this limit when a pack is smoked. Therefore, high-nicotine smokers can't absorb any extra nicotine beyond this daily maximum, explaining why they have the same blood nicotine levels as low-nicotine smokers after a pack.
The other choices do not fully explain the finding. While [REDACTED] suggests low-nicotine smokers may compensate by smoking more, it doesn't account for the hard limit on daily nicotine absorption. Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not directly relevant to explaining the observation.
Instructions:
1. Read the question stem carefully and identify the specific finding that needs to be explained.
2. Analyze each answer choice to see if it accounts for the finding.
3. Look for a choice that provides a complete, direct explanation for the observation.
4. Eliminate choices that are irrelevant or only partially explain the finding.
5. Be wary of choices that require you to make unsupported assumptions.
6. Double-check that your selected answer fully addresses the question being asked.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and answer choices carefully, paying attention to specific details and wording.
 - Focus on finding the choice that directly explains the stated finding or observation.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or leaps in logic.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are only tangentially related or fail to fully account for the finding.
 - Don't be misled by choices that are only partially correct or introduce irrelevant details.
 - Take your time to reason through each choice systematically before selecting a final answer.
