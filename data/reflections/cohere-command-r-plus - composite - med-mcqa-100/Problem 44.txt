Solution:
The Bishop score criteria are as follows: 
- Dilation: 0 points for 0-3 cm, 1 point for 4-5 cm, 2 points for 6-[REDACTED] cm, and 3 points for >[REDACTED] cm. 
- Consistency: 0 points for firm, 1 point for medium/average, and 2 points for soft/flabby. 
- Effacement: 0 points for 0-30%, 1 point for 40-50%, 2 points for 60-[REDACTED]0%, and 3 points for >[REDACTED]0%. 
- Fetal station: 0 points for floating/high, 1 point for -3 to -1 cm, 2 points for 0 cm, and 3 points for +1 to +3 cm. 
- Position: 0 points for posterior, 2 points for mid/anterior, and 3 points for anterior lip. 

Given the information: 
- Dilation: 3 cm = 2 points
- Consistency: slightly soft = 1 point
- Effacement: < 0.5 cm suggests 60-[REDACTED]0% effacement = 2 points
- Fetal station: -1 = 1 point
- Position: anterior = 2 points

The total Bishop score = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
- Review the criteria for each component of the Bishop score. 
- Assign points for each component based on the provided information.
