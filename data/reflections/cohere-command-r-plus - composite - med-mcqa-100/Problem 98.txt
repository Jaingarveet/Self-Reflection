Solution: Pyloric stenosis is a condition that leads to the narrowing of the pylorus, the passage connecting the stomach and the small intestine. This obstruction can cause a backup of stomach contents, resulting in a distended stomach. The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is the single bubble appearance, which reflects this distension. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the medical condition: Pyloric stenosis involves the narrowing of the pylorus.
2. Recall X-ray findings: Associate pyloric stenosis with the single bubble appearance on X-ray due to stomach distension.
3. Interpret the choices: 
    - [REDACTED] refers to the distended stomach bubble.
    - Double and triple bubble appearances indicate other gastrointestinal abnormalities but are not specific to pyloric stenosis.
    - Multiple air-fluid levels can suggest intestinal obstruction but are not specific enough.
4. Choose the answer: Select option [REDACTED] as the single bubble appearance is the characteristic X-ray finding of pyloric stenosis.

Advice:
- Ensure a solid understanding of basic medical conditions and their classic presentations.
- Be cautious of overgeneralizations and misassociations.
- Practice recalling and applying medical knowledge to interpret imaging findings accurately.
- Familiarize yourself with common X-ray appearances and their associated conditions.
- When interpreting imaging findings, consider the specific anatomical structures and their functions.
