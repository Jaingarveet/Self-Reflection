Solution:
The given quadratic equation is:
$$y = a(x - 2)(x + 4) = a(x^2 - 8x + 8)$$
The vertex of the parabola is given by:
$$(c, d) = \left(\frac{-b}{2a}, \frac{-b^2}{4a}\right)$$
Here, $b = -2$ and $a$ is a nonzero constant.
Substituting the values, we get:
$$(c, d) = \left(\frac{2}{2}, \frac{(-2)^2}{4}\right) = (1, 4)$$
So, the vertex is $(1, 4)$.
Now, we can find $d$ as:
$$d = 4 = -9a$$
Therefore, $d = -9a$.
