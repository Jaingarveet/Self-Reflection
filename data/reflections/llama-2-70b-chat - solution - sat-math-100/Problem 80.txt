Solution:
We can solve this problem by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for $k$.

$$kx - 3y = 4$$
$$4x - 5y = 7$$

Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:

$$kx - 3y = 4 = 4x - 5y$$

Subtracting $4x$ from both sides gives us:

$$-3y = -5y$$

Therefore, $k = \frac{12}{5}$.
