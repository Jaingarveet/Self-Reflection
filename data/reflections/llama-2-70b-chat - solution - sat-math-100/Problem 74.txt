Solution:
We can start by factoring the expression:

$$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{x+2}{x+2} \cdot \frac{x+3}{x+3} = \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x+2)(x+3)} = \frac{x+2}{x+3}$$

Now, we can compare the resulting expression with the given choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is not equivalent to $\frac{x+2}{x+3}$.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is equivalent to $\frac{x+2}{x+3}$.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is not equivalent to $\frac{x+2}{x+3}$.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is not equivalent to $\frac{x+2}{x+3}$.
