Solution:
We are given two equations:

3x + b = 5x - 7
3y + c = 5y - 7

We can solve the first equation for x:

x = (5x - 7) / 3
x = 5x/3 - 7/3
x = 5(x/3) - 7/3

Now, we can substitute the expression for x into the second equation:

3(y/3) + c = 5(y/3) - 7/3
3y/3 + c = 5y/3 - 7/3
3y + c = 5y - 7/3

Now, we can solve for y:

y = (5y - 7/3) / 3
y = 5y/3 - 7/9
y = 5(y/3) - 7/9

Now, we can substitute the expression for y into the first equation:

3x + b = 5(y/3) - 7/9
3x + b = 5y/3 - 7/9

Now, we can see that b is equal to c minus 1/2.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
