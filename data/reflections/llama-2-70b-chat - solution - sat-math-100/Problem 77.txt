Solution:
List [REDACTED] has a mean of (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5.
List [REDACTED] has a mean of (2+3+3+4+4+5)/6 = 3.5.
List [REDACTED] has a standard deviation of sqrt(((1-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^2 + (6-3.5)^2)/6) = 1.5811.
List [REDACTED] has a standard deviation of sqrt(((2-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^2)/6) = 1.3803.
Since the standard deviations are different (1.5811 and 1.3803), the correct answer is option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
