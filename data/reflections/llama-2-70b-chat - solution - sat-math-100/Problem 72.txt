Solution:
We are given the equation h = [REDACTED]a + 28.6, which represents a linear function.
To find the estimated increase in height each year, we need to find the slope of the line.
The slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
In this case, we can choose any two values for a, such as a = 2 and a = [REDACTED].
Substituting a = 2 into the equation, we get h = [REDACTED](2) + 28.6 = 100.8.
Substituting a = [REDACTED] into the equation, we get h = [REDACTED]([REDACTED]) + 28.6 = 108.6.
Now we can calculate the slope:
Slope = (108.6 - 100.8) / ([REDACTED] - 2) = [REDACTED]
The slope tells us that the boy's height increases by [REDACTED] inches each year.
