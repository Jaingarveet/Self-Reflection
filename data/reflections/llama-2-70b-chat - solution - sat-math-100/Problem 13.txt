Solution:
We are given the equation:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$

If we substitute $x=9$, we get:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$

We can solve this equation by adding 9 to both sides:

$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$

Square rooting both sides, we get:

$$k+2=8[REDACTED]$$

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

$$k=[REDACTED]9$$

Therefore, the value of $k$ is [REDACTED]9.
