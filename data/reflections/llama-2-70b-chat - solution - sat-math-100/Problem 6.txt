Solution:
We are given two equations:
b = 2.35 + 0.25x
c = 1.75 + 0.40x

We want to find when the price per pound of beef is equal to the price per pound of chicken.

We can set up an equation:
b = c

Substituting b and c with their equations:
2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x

0.25x = 0.40x

x = 4

Now, we can find the price per pound of beef when x = 4:
b = 2.35 + 0.25(4)
b = 2.35 + 1.00
b = 3.35

Therefore, the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken was $\$3.35$.
