Solution:
We need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.
We can start by noticing that the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ implies that as $t$ increases, $a$ also increases.
Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.
We can now look at the given choices:

[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]

The largest value of $t$ is [REDACTED], so we can choose option [REDACTED].
