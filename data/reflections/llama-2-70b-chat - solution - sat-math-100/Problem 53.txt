Solution:
[REDACTED] line with a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$ and passes through the origin will have the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
We can substitute the coordinates of the given points into this equation to determine which point lies on the line.

* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=0$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0) \cdot 7$, which is not true.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=1$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(1) \cdot 7$, which is true.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=7$ and $y=7$ into the equation, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(7) \cdot 7$, which is not true.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Substituting $x=14$ and $y=2$ into the equation, we get $2 = \frac{1}{7}(14) \cdot 2$, which is true.

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is [REDACTED].
