Solution:
Let's examine the table again:

| | | Course | | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gender | Female | 35 | 53 | 62 |
|  | Male | 44 | 59 | 57 |
|  | Total | 79 | 112 | 119 | 310 |

We can see that the number of male respondents enrolled in Geometry is 59, not 44. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which accounts for approximately 19% of all survey respondents.
