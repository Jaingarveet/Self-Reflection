Solution:
We have $a^{2} + b^{2} = z$ and $ab = y$.
We need to find an expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$.

Let's expand the given equations:

$a^{2} + b^{2} = z$
$ab = y$

Now, we can start creating expressions using these equations:

$a^{2} + b^{2} = (a + b)^{2} - 2ab$ ....................(1)
$ab = (a + b)(a - b)$ ....................(2)

Now, substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

$(a + b)^{2} - 2(a + b)(a - b) = z$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$(a + b)^{2} - 2ab = z$

Now, we can compare this with the given choices:

[REDACTED]: $(2a + 2b)^{2}$

We can rewrite this as:

$(2a + 2b)^{2} = (2a + b + b)^{2}$

Using the distributive property, we can expand:

$(2a + b + b)^{2} = (2a + b)^{2} + 2b(2a + b) + b^{2}$

Simplifying, we get:

$(2a + b + b)^{2} = (2a + b)^{2} + 4ab$

Which is equivalent to equation (3) we derived above.

So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: $(2a + 2b)^{2}$.
