Solution:
The given table shows some values of $x$ and $f(x)$.
We can observe that $f(x)$ is a polynomial function of degree $3$.
The factors of a polynomial of degree $3$ are binomials of the form $(x-a)$, where $a$ is a constant.
We can compare the given choices with the values in the table to find the factor of $f(x)$.

The correct answer is $C$, [REDACTED], because $f(x)$ has a zero at $x=4$.
