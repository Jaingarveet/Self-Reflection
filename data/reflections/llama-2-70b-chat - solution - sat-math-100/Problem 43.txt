Solution:
We can start by simplifying the given equation:

$$\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - [REDACTED] = 9x - 6$$

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

$$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 9x - \frac{2}{3} \cdot 6 - [REDACTED] = 9x - 6$$

Simplifying further, we get:

$$6x - \frac{12}{3} - [REDACTED] = 9x - 6$$

Collecting like terms, we get:

$$6x - 12 - [REDACTED] = 9x - 6$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$6x - 16 = 9x - 6$$

Subtracting 9x from both sides, we get:

$$-3x = -10$$

Dividing both sides by -3, we get:

$$x = \frac{10}{3}$$

Now, we need to find the value of $3x - 2$.

We can substitute the value of x into the expression:

$$3x - 2 = 3 \cdot \frac{10}{3} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8$$

So, the value of $3x - 2$ is 8.
