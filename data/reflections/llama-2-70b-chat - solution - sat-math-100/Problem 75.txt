Solution:
We are given the supply function $S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$ and the demand function $D(P) = 220 - P$.
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we set the two functions equal to each other:
$S(P) = D(P)$
$\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$
$P = 120$
