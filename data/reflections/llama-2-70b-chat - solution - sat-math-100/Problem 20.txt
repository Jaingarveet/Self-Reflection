Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination.
By substitution, we have:
$$\begin{aligned}
2.4 x - 1.5 y &= 0.3 \\
1.6 x + 0.5 y &= -1.3
\end{aligned}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$2.4 x - 1.5(1.6 x + 0.5 y) = 0.3$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$2.4 x - 2.4 x - [REDACTED] y = 0.3$$
$$-[REDACTED] y = -2.1$$
$$y = 2.625$$
Now, substituting $y = 2.625$ into one of the original equations, we get:
$$1.6 x + 0.5(2.625) = -1.3$$
$$1.6 x + 1.3125 = -1.3$$
$$1.6 x = -2.6125$$
$$x = -1.695$$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is -1.695.
