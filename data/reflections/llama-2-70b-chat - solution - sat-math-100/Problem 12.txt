Solution:
Let's call the population of City X "X" and the population of City Y "Y".
We know that X = Y + 20,000 (since the population of City X increased by 20%)
We also know that X + Y = 120,000 (since the populations are equal)
X = Y + 20,000 ... (1)
X + Y = 120,000 ... (2)
Subtracting (1) from (2), we get:
Y = 100,000

Now we can find the population of City Y in 2010:
Y = 100,000 - 10% of 100,000
Y = 100,000 - 10,000
Y = [REDACTED]
