Solution:
The parabola and the line intersect at two points, so we can find the x-coordinates of these points by setting the equations equal to each other and solving for x.

$y = (x - 11)^2$
$y = 25$

$ (x - 11)^2 = 25$
$x - 11 = ±√25$
$x = 11 ± √25$

Now we can find the distance between the two points:

$A[REDACTED] = √((11 + √25) - (11 - √25))^2$
$A[REDACTED] = √(2(11 + √25)) = 2(11 + √25)$

$A[REDACTED] = 2(11) + 2(√25) = 22 + 2(5√5) = 22 + [REDACTED]√5$

$A[REDACTED] = 22 + [REDACTED]√5 = [REDACTED](2 + 5√5)$

$A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED](2 + 5√5) = [REDACTED](7) = 70$
