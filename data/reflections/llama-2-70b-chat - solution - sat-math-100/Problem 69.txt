Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline is $4$ per gallon.
2. He wants to reduce his weekly expenditure by $\$ 5$.
3. Therefore, he needs to save $\$ 5$ on gasoline per week.
4. Since gasoline costs $\$ 4$ per gallon, he needs to save $\$ 5$ / $\$ 4$ = 1.25 gallons of gasoline per week.
5. Since Alan's car can travel 25 miles per gallon, he needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 1.25 \* 25 = 31.25 miles.

Now, let's look at the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The correct equation is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which means that Alan needs to reduce his weekly driving distance by 5 \* 25 = 125 miles.
