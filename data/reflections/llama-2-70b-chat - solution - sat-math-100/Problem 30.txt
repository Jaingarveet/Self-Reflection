Solution:
Let's analyze the supply function $S(P)$:

$S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$

We can see that the coefficient of $P$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, so a $10$ dollar increase in the price ($P + 10$) will result in a $\frac{10}{2} = 10$ unit increase in the quantity supplied.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
