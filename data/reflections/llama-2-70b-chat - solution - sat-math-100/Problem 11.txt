Solution:
We can start by distributing the $2x$ factor to the two terms inside the parentheses:

$2x(x^2 - 3x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2$

Now, we can compare this expression with the given choices:

[REDACTED]: $-4x^2$

This choice is not equivalent to our expression.

[REDACTED]: $3x^3 - x^2$

This choice is not equivalent to our expression.

[REDACTED]: $2x^3 - 3x$

This choice is equivalent to our expression.

[REDACTED]: $2x^3 - 6x^2$

This choice is equivalent to our expression.
