Solution:
We can start by using the formula for the equation of a circle: $(x-h)^{2} + (y-k)^{2} = r^{2}$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
In this case, the center is $(0, 4)$ and the radius is half the length of the diameter, which is $\sqrt{\frac{41}{9}}$.
Therefore, the equation of the circle is:
$x^{2} + (y-4)^{2} = \frac{7^{2}}{9}$
Simplifying, we get:
$x^{2} + (y-4)^{2} = \frac{25}{9}$
Which matches choice [REDACTED].
