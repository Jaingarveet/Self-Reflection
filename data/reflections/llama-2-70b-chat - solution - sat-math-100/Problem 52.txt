Solution:
Let's X be the number of pears produced by Type [REDACTED] trees.
Since Type [REDACTED] trees produced 20% more pears than Type [REDACTED] trees, Type [REDACTED] trees produced (1 + 0.2) * X = 1.2X pears.
We know that Type [REDACTED] trees produced 144 pears, so we can set up the equation:
1.2X = 144

Now, divide both sides by 1.2 to solve for X:
X = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
