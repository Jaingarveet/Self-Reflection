Solution:
The correct solution is as follows:
The weight of an object on a planet can be found by using the formula $W=mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth, so we need to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.
We can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.
The acceleration due to gravity on [REDACTED] is 11.1 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Using the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of the object on [REDACTED]:
$W=m(11.1)$
$W=150(11.1)$
$W=1665$
The weight of the object on [REDACTED] is approximately 1665 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons.
Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on [REDACTED].
