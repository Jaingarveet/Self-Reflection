Solution:
Let's start by squaring both sides of the equation:
$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
Moving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:
$$3x = 9$$
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
$$x = 3$$
However, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.
Let's try another approach. We can factor the left-hand side of the equation:
$$4x = \sqrt{4x}$$
We know that $\sqrt{4x} = 2x$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$$4x = 2x$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$$2x = x$$
Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
$$x = 0$$
So, the only value of x that satisfies the given equation is x = 0.
