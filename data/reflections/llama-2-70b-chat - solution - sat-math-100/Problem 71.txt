Solution:
The probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never," can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(Always|Not Never) = P(Not Never|Always) \* P(Always) / P(Not Never)

From the given table, P(Not Never) = 1 - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED].
P(Always) = 0.309.
P(Not Never|Always) = 1 - 0.309 = [REDACTED]1.

Now, we can calculate P(Always|Not Never):
P(Always|Not Never) = P(Not Never|Always) \* P(Always) / P(Not Never)
= [REDACTED]1 \* 0.309 / [REDACTED]
= [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
