Solution:
The correct solution is:
Prob(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 9LF) / (122 - 9LF + RM)
Prob(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 9(18)) / (122 - 9(18) + RM)
Prob(right-handed student is female) = (122 - 162) / (122 - 162 + RM)
Prob(right-handed student is female) = -40 / (122 - 162 + RM)
Prob(right-handed student is female) = -40 / 60
Prob(right-handed student is female) = -2/3
