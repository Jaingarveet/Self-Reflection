* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the fossil record can provide information about a dinosaur's diet, length, and type of food it ate, but it does not contain any clues about its skin color.
