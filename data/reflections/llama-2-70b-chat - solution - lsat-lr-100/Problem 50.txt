Solution:
The study found that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the body does not regulate the amount of nicotine it absorbs, but instead, the amount of nicotine that can be absorbed is limited by the physical properties of the blood.
