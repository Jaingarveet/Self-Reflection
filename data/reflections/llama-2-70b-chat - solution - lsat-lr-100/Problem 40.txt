Solution:

1. Identify the conclusion of the argument: Publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
2. Identify the premises of the argument:
	* The average subscription rate for scholarly journals has increased dramatically.
	* The costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant.
3. Identify the weakening factor: Choice [REDACTED] states that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
4. Explain how the weakening factor affects the argument: The increase in subscription rates is not due to an increase in demand from individuals, but rather from an increase in the number of libraries subscribing to the journals. Therefore, the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily indicate an increase in profitability for the publishers.
5. Conclude that choice [REDACTED] weakens the argument.
