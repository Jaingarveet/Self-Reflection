Solution:
1. Identify the unusual metaphor used in both Jordan's and Grey's books.
2. Look for other sources that may have contained the same metaphor.
3. Determine if the idea expressed in Grey's book using the metaphor is related to the ideas in Jordan's book.
4. Consider the possibility that both authors may have obtained the metaphor from the same source.
5. Evaluate the strength of the argument that Grey read Jordan's book based on the evidence.
