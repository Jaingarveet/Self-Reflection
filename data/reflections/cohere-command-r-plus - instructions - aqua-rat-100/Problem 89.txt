1. Understand the question and identify the given information: initial charge, additional charge per unit distance, and budget. 
2. Recognize that the question asks for the maximum distance achievable with a given budget. 
3. Calculate the cost for each additional quarter-mile, not mile. 
4. Start from the initial distance and calculate the cost incrementally up to a reasonable distance, ensuring it doesn't exceed the budget. 
5. Determine the maximum distance achievable within the budget. 
6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated maximum distance.
