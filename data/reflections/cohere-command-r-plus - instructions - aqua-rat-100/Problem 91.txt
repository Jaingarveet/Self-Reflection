Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: [REDACTED] travels in different directions and wants to know the final distance from home.
2. Identify the net displacement in each direction: south-north cancels out, leaving 3 km east and 2 km north.
3. Recognize that the east-west and south-north displacements are independent and not perpendicular.
4. Calculate the distance for each direction separately: 3 km east and 2 km north from the starting point.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated distance from home.
