Instructions:
1. Identify the given values: speed to location [REDACTED] ($70$ mph), speed returning to location [REDACTED] ($[REDACTED]$ mph), and time before the end of the trip when he was still approaching [REDACTED] ($3$ hours). 
2. Define the unknown value: let the distance between locations [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] be $x$ miles. 
3. Calculate the time taken to travel from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] and from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], and express them in terms of $x$. 
4. Find the total trip time by adding the two times calculated in step 3. 
5. Set up an equation: the total trip time minus the time spent before arriving at [REDACTED] should equal the time it takes to cover the remaining $70$ miles. 
6. Solve the equation for $x$ to find the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. 
7. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result.
