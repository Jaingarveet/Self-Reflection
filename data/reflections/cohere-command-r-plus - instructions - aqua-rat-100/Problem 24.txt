Instructions:
1. Understand the variables: x = average of highest and lowest scores, y = average of the entire class, z = number of students.
2. Recognize that the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x.
3. Calculate the sum of the remaining scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers: zy - 2x.
4. Determine the number of remaining students: z - 2.
5. Find the average score for the remaining students by dividing the sum of their scores by the number of students: ((zy - 2x) / (z - 2)).
6. Ensure your algebraic manipulations are correct and that you are properly applying the order of operations.
