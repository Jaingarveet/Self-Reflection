Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: There are two rounds of drawing marbles, and the key information is the number of black marbles after each round and the probability it yields for the second round. 
2. Identify the given data: 20 initial black marbles, 20 pulled and 1 black in the second round, probability of 1/20 for the second round. 
3. Calculate the total number of black marbles after the second round: 20 initial + 1 new = 21 black marbles. 
4. Recognize the misinterpretation: The question states that only 20 marbles were put back, so the total number of black marbles is 20, not 21. 
5. Set up the equation: The probability 1/20 represents the ratio of black marbles to the total, so 1/20 = 20/Q. 
6. Solve for Q: Multiply both sides by 20Q to get 20 = 20Q/20, which simplifies to Q = [REDACTED]0.
