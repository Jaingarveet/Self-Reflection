Instructions:
1. Denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base as $x$.
2. Set up trigonometric equations using the angles and ratios: $\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x}$ and $\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10}$.
3. Equate these equations and solve for $x$ to find the distance traveled.
4. Calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$).
5. Simplify the expression and choose the answer option that matches your result.
