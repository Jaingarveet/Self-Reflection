Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: a man wants to catch the first train of two lines with a 10-minute frequency, starting at slightly different times. 
2. Identify the relevant probabilities: the probability of missing the first train on each line. 
3. Calculate the probability of missing both first trains by multiplying the individual probabilities. 
4. Find the probability of catching the first train by subtracting the probability of missing both from 1. 
5. Choose the answer that best approximates your calculated result.
