Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: friends planned to spend a certain amount, but some didn't show up, increasing the cost for those who attended. 
2. Set up two equations: one for the original plan and one for the updated plan. 
3. Isolate for 'n' in both equations. 
4. Set the two equations equal to each other, representing the relationship between the original and updated plans. 
5. Simplify the equation and solve for 'n'. 
6. Interpret the result: 'n' is the total number of friends, so subtract 4 to find the number who attended.
