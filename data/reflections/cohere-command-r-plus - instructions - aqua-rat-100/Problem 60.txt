Instructions:
1. Identify the given values for minor arcs A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], and the bisected minor arc A[REDACTED] (and BC). 
2. Calculate the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. 
3. Find the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. 
4. Check if the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is greater than half the circle's circumference (1[REDACTED]). 
5. If it is greater, subtract the measure from 1[REDACTED] to find the complementary angle, which represents the minor arc A[REDACTED].
