Instructions:
1. Calculate the vertical speed of the shuttle using the given distance and time. 
2. Recognize that this speed is for vertical movement, and it is different from the speed at which the shuttle passes a point. 
3. Calculate the length of the shuttle by dividing the given distance (700m) by the time taken to pass a point (5s). 
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
