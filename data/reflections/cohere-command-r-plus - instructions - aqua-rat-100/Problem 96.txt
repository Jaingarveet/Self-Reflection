Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] started a business with certain investments, and [REDACTED] joined later with a different investment. They made a total profit at the end of the year, and [REDACTED] received a specific share. The task is to determine the number of months [REDACTED] joined after [REDACTED].
2. Define variables: Let [REDACTED] join x months after [REDACTED].
3. Calculate A's profit for the first [REDACTED] and the remaining 10 months separately, as A's investment period is not the same as [REDACTED] and C's.
4. Calculate B's profit for (12-x) months using the formula: B's investment * (12-x)/12 * (total profit/total investment).
5. Write the equation: Sum of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and C's profits equals the total profit.
6. Simplify the equation and solve for x to find the number of months [REDACTED] joined after [REDACTED].
7. Check your solution: Ensure that the value of x makes sense in the context of the problem.
