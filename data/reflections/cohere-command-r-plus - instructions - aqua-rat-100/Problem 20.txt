Instructions:
1. Calculate the initial total number of members (boys + girls). 
2. Recognize that the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which can be simplified to 4/7 for boys and 3/7 for girls. 
3. Set up the equation: Total members = (4/7) * Initial members. 
4. Plug in the value of the initial members and calculate the final answer.
