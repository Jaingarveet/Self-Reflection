Instructions:
1. Identify the relevant formula: the Pythagorean theorem for the diagonal of a rectangular solid.
2. Plug the dimensions into the formula: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$, where $a, b$, and $c$ are the sides of the rectangular solid.
3. Simplify the square root: $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{118}$.
4. Calculate the square root: $\sqrt{118} \approx 10.87$.
5. Choose the answer choice that matches the calculated value.
