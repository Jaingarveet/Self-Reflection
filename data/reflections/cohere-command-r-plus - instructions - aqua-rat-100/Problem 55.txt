Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: the man's rates in still water and against the current.
2. Define variables: let 'x' be the man's rate along the current and 'y' be the current's rate.
3. Set up a system of equations: use the given rates to create two equations.
4. Solve the system: add the equations to find the value of 'x'.
5. Substitute and solve: use the value of 'x' to find 'y' by substituting into the second equation.
6. Interpret the result: the man's rate along the current is 'x' kmph.
