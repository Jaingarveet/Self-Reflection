Instructions:
1. Identify the variables: let John's money = x
2. Interpret Mark's statement: from Mark's perspective, after receiving half of John's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's contribution + Mark's original money = Rs. 75
3. Interpret John's statement: from John's perspective, after receiving one-third of Mark's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's original money + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75
4. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation
5. Plug the value of x back into the equations to find Mark's original money
6. Calculate the answer choices to check which one matches our calculated amount
