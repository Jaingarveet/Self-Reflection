Instructions:
1. Count the total number of ways to choose 4 points out of the 6 given points, including F. 
2. Identify and subtract the cases where the sides intersect (cannot form a valid quadrilateral). 
3. Consider the quadrilaterals that include point F (the center of the pentagon). 
4. Add the count of quadrilaterals including F to the count of quadrilaterals not including F to get the final answer.
