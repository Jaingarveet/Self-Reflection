Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST, and the fact that U is the midpoint of ST.
2. Identify the goal: find the length of RU.
3. Calculate UT since U is the midpoint of ST (divide ST by 2).
4. Find RU by subtracting UT from RT.
5. Double-check your calculations and the units used.
