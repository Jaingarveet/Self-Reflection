Explanation:
The argument's reasoning is questionable because it infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause (the personal automobile) that it could only have resulted from that cause. The argument ignores the possibility that other factors, such as changes in urban planning policies or economic conditions, may have also played a role in shaping the modern cityscape.

Error Keywords:
- Inference
- Causality
- Single-cause fallacy

Solution:
The argument should consider the possibility that other factors, in addition to the personal automobile, have contributed to the development of modern cities. The argument should also provide evidence to support the claim that the personal automobile was the sole cause of the observed urban planning patterns.

Instructions:
1. Identify the main cause-and-effect relationship presented in the argument.
2. Consider alternative causes that may have contributed to the observed effect.
3. Evaluate the strength of the evidence provided to support the main cause-and-effect relationship.
4. If necessary, revise the argument to address any weaknesses in the evidence or reasoning.

Advice:
- Be aware of the potential for single-cause fallacies in arguments.
- Consider alternative explanations for observed phenomena.
- Look for evidence that supports or undermines the main cause-and-effect relationship.
- Be open to revising your initial conclusion based on new information or perspectives.
