Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The university president's argument concludes that the university must market its programs more aggressively to increase enrollment and maintain the quality of education. The correct assumption is that reducing spending next year would negatively impact the quality of education (choice D).

The other choices do not support the conclusion:

* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would negatively impact the quality of education, which contradicts the president's argument.
* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that increasing enrollment would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but the argument only establishes a link between marketing and enrollment, not between enrollment and spending reductions.
* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that the university will increase its enrollment if it markets its programs more aggressively, but it does not address the impact of spending reductions on the quality of education.
* Choice [REDACTED]: This statement suggests that marketing would eliminate the need for spending reductions, but, like choice [REDACTED], it does not follow from the argument's premises.
