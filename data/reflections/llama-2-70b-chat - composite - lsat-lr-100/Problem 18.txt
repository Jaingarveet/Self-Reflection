Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"

This answer choice is similar to the reasoning in the original scenario, where Ed chooses between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], and chooses [REDACTED], which is more expensive. In choice [REDACTED], the rabbit is faced with two options, doubling back on the fox or fleeing for nearby cover, and chooses the former because the latter is not possible due to the lack of nearby cover.

The other answer choices do not use the same type of reasoning as the original scenario. Choice [REDACTED] states that Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties, which is the opposite of the reasoning in the original scenario. Choice [REDACTED] states that Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride, so she would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park, which is also different from the original scenario. Choice [REDACTED] states that Asteroid Y's orbit is more eccentric than asteroid X's because it's affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull, which has nothing to do with choosing between two equally desirable options. Choice [REDACTED] states that Miyoko will probably not enter this program because she has no desire to take a class in physics or art, which is not similar to the original scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"
