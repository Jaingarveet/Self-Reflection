Explanation:
The political scientist's argument assumes that the only reason for decreasing voter turnout is the belief that politicians cannot solve important problems. However, the argument does not provide any evidence or justification for this claim. It ignores the possibility that other factors, such as voter apathy, disillusionment with politics, or lack of interest in the issues being addressed, may also contribute to decreasing voter turnout. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
