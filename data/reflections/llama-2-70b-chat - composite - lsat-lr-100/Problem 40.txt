Explanation:
The argument concludes that publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago because the average subscription rate has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing have remained fairly constant. However, choice [REDACTED] states that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. This means that the increase in subscription rates is not due to an increase in demand from individuals, but rather from an increase in the number of libraries subscribing to the journals. Therefore, the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily indicate an increase in profitability for the publishers. Choice [REDACTED] weakens the argument by providing an alternative explanation for the increase in subscription rates.

Error Keywords:

* Subscription rates
* Profitability

Solution:

3. Identify the weakening factor: Choice [REDACTED] states that most subscribers to scholarly journals are individuals, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
4. Explain how the weakening factor affects the argument: The increase in subscription rates is not due to an increase in demand from individuals, but rather from an increase in the number of libraries subscribing to the journals. Therefore, the increase in subscription rates does not necessarily indicate an increase in profitability for the publishers.
5. Conclude that choice [REDACTED] weakens the argument.
