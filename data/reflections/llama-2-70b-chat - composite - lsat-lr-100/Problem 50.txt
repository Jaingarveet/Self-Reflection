Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the study's findings. 
I thought the study showed that the body regulates the amount of nicotine it absorbs, but the correct answer suggests that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the study's findings
 - Misunderstanding of the question
 - Failure to consider the physical limitations of nicotine absorption
Solution:
The study found that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the body does not regulate the amount of nicotine it absorbs, but instead, the amount of nicotine that can be absorbed is limited by the physical properties of the blood.
Instructions:
1. Re-read the question and the study's findings carefully.
2. Consider the physical limitations of nicotine absorption.
3. Choose the answer that best explains the study's findings.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the study's findings.
 - Consider all possible explanations for the study's findings.
 - Be aware of physical limitations that may affect the study's results.
 - Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with the study's findings.
 - Consider seeking additional information or expertise if needed.
