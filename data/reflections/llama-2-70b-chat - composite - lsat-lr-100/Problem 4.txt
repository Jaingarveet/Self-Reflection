Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between production costs and profitability in the film and television industries. I thought that the high production costs of film were the primary driver of the need for large audiences, whereas, in reality, it is the reliance on ticket sales for revenue that drives this need.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of industry economics
* Failure to consider the role of advertising in television profitability

Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]" This answer choice accurately explains why television executives do not need to maximize the number of viewers to achieve their profit goals. Unlike movie executives, who rely on ticket sales for revenue, television executives generate revenue from sponsors who are interested in the purchasing power of the viewers. Therefore, the number of viewers is not the primary concern for television executives.

Instructions:

1. Understand the profit models of both the film and television industries.
2. Identify the key revenue streams for each industry.
3. Consider the role of advertising in television profitability.
4. Evaluate the impact of production costs on profitability.

Advice:

* Always consider the broader context of the problem, including the industry's profit model and revenue streams.
* Be aware of the role of advertising in television profitability.
* Don't assume that production costs are the primary driver of profitability.
* Take the time to carefully evaluate each answer choice and consider its implications.
