Explanation:
The professor's argument is based on the premise that thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine the full implications of interrelated ideas and make intellectual progress. The conclusion that freedom of thought is not a precondition for intellectual progress logically follows if we assume that without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought. This is stated in choice [REDACTED], which is the correct answer.

* Choice [REDACTED] is not relevant to the professor's argument.
* Choice [REDACTED] is not stated in the argument.
* Choice [REDACTED] is the opposite of the professor's argument.
* Choice [REDACTED] is not related to the professor's argument.
