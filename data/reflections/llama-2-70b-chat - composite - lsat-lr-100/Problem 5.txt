Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"

The question states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953, but meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged. This suggests that there must be another factor contributing to the increase in recorded tornadoes.

Option [REDACTED] provides a plausible explanation for the increase in recorded tornadoes. If many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953, then it is likely that more tornadoes are being reported and recorded now than in the past. This increased reporting could contribute to the observed increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually, even if the actual number of tornadoes occurring has not changed.

None of the other options provide a plausible explanation for the increase in recorded tornadoes. Option [REDACTED] is not relevant to the issue at hand, as it merely states that meteorologists did not have as much knowledge about tornadoes before 1953. Option [REDACTED] states that the intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953, but this does not explain why more tornadoes are being recorded. Option [REDACTED] states that the number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years, which does not address the larger trend of an increase in recorded tornadoes since 1953. Option [REDACTED] states that the amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953, but this does not explain why more tornadoes are being recorded.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"
