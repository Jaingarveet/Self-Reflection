Explanation:
The correct answer is choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The argument states that the macaques' behavior of entering the hot spring was not observed before 1963, but became adopted by the entire troop by 1990. This suggests that the behavior was not genetically predetermined, but rather learned and passed on through social interaction. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.

The other choices are not necessarily related to the argument:

* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This statement is not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not mention genetic mutations.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This statement is also not relevant to the argument, as the argument does not mention genetic alterations or typical behaviors.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This statement is false, as social behaviors are influenced by genetics to some extent. However, the argument does not rely on this assumption.
* [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This statement is not necessarily true, as the argument only mentions that the behavior was adopted by the entire troop by 1990, without specifying whether it will persist over several generations.

Therefore, the best answer is choice [REDACTED].
