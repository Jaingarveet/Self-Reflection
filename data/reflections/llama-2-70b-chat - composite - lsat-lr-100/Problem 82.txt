Explanation:
Tamara's objection suggests that wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas. However, Choice [REDACTED] states that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period. This means that the precautions taken by the wealthy would not have been effective in detecting ninjas, as they would not have been able to detect ninjas in the majority of households. Therefore, Choice [REDACTED] is the strongest counter that Patricia can make to Tamara's objection.
