Explanation:
The argument depends on the assumption that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than those of non-native speakers. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, rather than distinct sentences. This challenges the illusion that native speakers perceive sentences as sequences of separate words. Therefore, assumption (E) is an essential part of the argument.
