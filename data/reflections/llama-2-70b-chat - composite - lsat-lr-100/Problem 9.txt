Explanation:
The microbiologist's argument is that the bacteria's exposure to heavy metals in sewage sludge has promoted their resistance to antibiotics. Choice [REDACTED] strengthens this argument by showing that bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals are not resistant to antibiotics. This suggests that the presence of heavy metals in the sewage sludge is a factor in the bacteria's development of antibiotic resistance.

The other choices do not strengthen the microbiologist's argument:

* Choice [REDACTED] is not relevant to the microbiologist's argument, as it does not address the relationship between heavy metal exposure and antibiotic resistance.
* Choice [REDACTED] is the opposite of the microbiologist's argument, as it suggests that antibiotic resistance contributes to the bacteria's resistance to heavy metal poisoning, rather than the other way around.
* Choice [REDACTED] is also not relevant, as it does not address the relationship between heavy metal exposure and antibiotic resistance.
* Choice [REDACTED] is not relevant, as it refers to bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge and therefore are not relevant to the microbiologist's argument.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
