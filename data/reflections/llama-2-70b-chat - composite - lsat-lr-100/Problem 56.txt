Explanation:
The conclusion that the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare, and that this lack of information leads to more frequent economic crises, logically follows from the assumption that economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases (choice B).

The other answer choices do not logically lead to the conclusion. Choice [REDACTED] states that people without political power are more likely to suffer from economic crises, but this does not necessarily relate to the availability of information. Choice [REDACTED] mentions that economic crises are common in nations where the government controls access to information, but this does not imply a causal relationship between the two. Choice [REDACTED] suggests that higher participation in economic decisions leads to better decisions, but this is unrelated to the availability of information. Choice [REDACTED] suggests that the elite may manipulate information for their own benefit, but this does not necessarily result in economic crises.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED].
