Solution:
1) Alan drives an average of 100 miles per week.
2) His car travels an average of 25 miles per gallon of gasoline.
3) Gasoline costs $4 per gallon.
4) Alan wants to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $5.
5) Let $m$ be the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.
6) The cost of driving these $m$ miles should be equal to the desired reduction of $5:
   - (Miles reduced / Miles per gallon) * Price per gallon = Desired reduction
   - ($m$ / 25) * $4 = $5
7) Simplify:
   - $m$ / 25 = 5 / 4
   - $m$ = 125 / 4
   - $m$ = 31.25
8) This matches the equation in choice [REDACTED]: $\frac{4}{25} m = 5$
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
