Solution:
Given the equation $3x - y = 12$, let's solve for the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$.
First, simplify the expression:
$\frac{8^x}{2^y} = \frac{(2^3)^x}{2^y} = \frac{2^{3x}}{2^y} = 2^{3x-y}$
Now, we can see that the exponent $3x-y$ is the same as the left-hand side of the given equation. 
Substituting the right-hand side of the equation:
$2^{3x-y} = 2^{12}$
Therefore, the value of $\frac{8^x}{2^y}$ is [REDACTED].
