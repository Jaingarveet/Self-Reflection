Explanation:

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

The engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now can be represented by a linear decay function, as the population is expected to decrease by 10% every 20 years. This means that the population will decrease at a constant rate, which can be represented by the formula:

Population ($t$ years from now) = Population present ($50,000$) x (1 - 0.10^t)

Where t is the number of years from the present.

So, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
