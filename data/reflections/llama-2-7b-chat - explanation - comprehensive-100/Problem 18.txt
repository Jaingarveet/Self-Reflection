Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. Based on the information provided, we can conclude that:

1. Robot 1 is type [REDACTED], as it picked up the red squares which are not red balls.
2. Robot 2 is not type [REDACTED], as it picked up the blue balls which are not red balls.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) No.1 is not Type [REDACTED] and No.2 is not Type [REDACTED].
