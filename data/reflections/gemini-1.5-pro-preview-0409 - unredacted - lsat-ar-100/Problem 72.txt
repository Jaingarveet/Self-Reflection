## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the constraints and overlooking a possible arrangement. I focused too heavily on the pharmacy being next to the optometrist, neglecting the possibility of it being next to the veterinarian. This oversight led me to an incorrect conclusion about the placement of the restaurant and toy store.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of constraints
*   Overlooking possibilities
*   Logic error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Pharmacy and Restaurant Placement:** We know the pharmacy is at one end and a restaurant at the other. 
2.  **Optometrist and Shoe Store:** These two are together but cannot be at either end due to the pharmacy and restaurant placement.
3.  **Pharmacy Constraint:** The pharmacy needs to be next to the optometrist OR the veterinarian. Since it's at an end, the optometrist/shoe store pair must be next to it.
4.  **Remaining Businesses:** We have a restaurant, veterinarian, and toy store left. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
5.  **Possible Arrangements:**
    *   **Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian:** This satisfies all constraints. The optometrist/shoe store pair is next to the pharmacy at one end, and the restaurant is at the other end. 
    *   **Veterinarian - Toy Store - Restaurant:** This also satisfies all constraints.
Therefore, the businesses on either side of the optometrist/shoe store pair could be a restaurant and the toy store (Option D).
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Ensure you understand the limitations and possibilities each constraint presents.
2.  **Consider all possible arrangements:** Don't fixate on the first solution that comes to mind. Explore different valid arrangements that satisfy all constraints.
3.  **Visualize the problem:** Draw a diagram or use another visual aid to represent the spaces and businesses. This can help identify potential solutions and avoid overlooking possibilities.
4.  **Work step-by-step:** Break down the problem into smaller steps and analyze each step carefully.
5.  **Review your solution:** Double-check that your final arrangement satisfies all the given constraints.
