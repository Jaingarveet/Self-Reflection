## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning focused on eliminating options based on the veterinarian's placement and the constraint regarding the toy store. However, I failed to fully consider the implications of the restaurant placement restrictions and their impact on the remaining spaces.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Constraint misinterpretation 
*   Incomplete analysis
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Veterinarian in space 5:** This leaves spaces 1-4 and 6-7 for the remaining businesses.
2.  **Restaurant placement:** One restaurant must be at an end (space 1 or 7), and they must have at least two spaces between them. 
3.  **Impact on remaining spaces:** With the veterinarian in space 5, placing a restaurant at either end (space 1 or 7) forces the other restaurant to be in space 4 to maintain the required separation.
Therefore, regardless of the other placements, a restaurant **must** be in space 4.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Identify fixed elements:** Begin by noting the placement of any businesses with fixed positions.
2.  **Analyze constraints:** Carefully consider each constraint and its implications for the remaining businesses.
3.  **Visualize the scenario:** Draw a diagram or mentally map the spaces to better understand the spatial relationships and limitations.
4.  **Consider all possibilities:** Explore different placement options while adhering to the constraints.
5.  **Focus on "must be true":** Eliminate options that are not guaranteed by the constraints, even if they seem likely.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Break down complex constraints:** Divide complex restrictions into smaller, easier-to-analyze parts.
*   **Pay attention to wording:**  Distinguish between "must," "could," and "cannot" to understand the certainty of each condition.
*   **Think step-by-step:** Avoid jumping to conclusions and carefully consider each deduction.
*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't overlooked any possibilities or contradictions.
