## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint "There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2." I incorrectly assumed this meant Zone 3 must have at least 3 representatives, leading me to eliminate option B.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Constraint violation
*   Logical reasoning error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Parra and Quinn together:** This eliminates options A and C.
2. **Stuckey and Udall together:** This eliminates option D.
3. **Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2:** This is satisfied by both options B and E.
4. **Remaining constraints:**
    *   Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) in Zone 1.
    *   Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) in Zone 2.
5. **Option E violates the constraint** as it places Tiao in Zone 1 and Udall in Zone 3, meaning neither is in Zone 2.
6. **Therefore, the correct answer is B**, which satisfies all constraints.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully analyze each constraint** and its implications.
2. **Eliminate options that violate any constraint.**
3. **Pay close attention to numerical constraints** and their possible interpretations.
4. **Consider all remaining options** against the remaining constraints.
5. **Choose the option that satisfies all constraints.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read the problem and constraints multiple times** to ensure full understanding.
*   **Break down complex constraints into simpler parts** for easier analysis.
*   **Consider all possible interpretations of constraints** before eliminating options.
*   **Use a systematic approach** to eliminate options and reach the correct answer.
*   **Practice similar problems** to improve logical reasoning and problem-solving skills.
