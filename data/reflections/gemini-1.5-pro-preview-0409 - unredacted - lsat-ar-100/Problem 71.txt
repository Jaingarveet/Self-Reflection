## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint "There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2." I focused on ensuring Zone 3 had *more* representatives than Zone 2 but neglected the possibility of them having the *same* number of representatives.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Constraint violation
*   Logical reasoning error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Pairings:** We know Parra and Quinn are together, and Stuckey and Udall are together. 
2. **Tiao's Placement:** Tiao cannot be with Parra or Udall, so Tiao must be in Zone 1 alone.
3. **Remaining Representatives:** This leaves Kim and Mahr to fill the remaining spots.
4. **Zone Assignments:** Since Zone 3 must have at least the same number of representatives as Zone 2 (which has 1, Tiao), Kim and Mahr must both be in Zone 3.
Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Kim, Mahr**.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Identify pairings or exclusions:** Note any individuals who must be together or cannot be together.
2. **Place individuals with constraints:** Assign individuals with limitations to their respective zones first.
3. **Consider remaining individuals:** Analyze where the remaining individuals can be placed based on remaining constraints.
4. **Review zone population requirements:** Ensure each zone meets the minimum or maximum number of individuals required.
5. **Double-check constraints:** Verify that all given conditions are satisfied by the final arrangement.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to each constraint and condition.
*   **Visualize:** Consider using diagrams or tables to represent the problem.
*   **Eliminate options:** Rule out choices that violate the given conditions.
*   **Consider all possibilities:** Don't overlook scenarios that meet the minimum requirements of a constraint.
*   **Review and revise:** Double-check your solution to ensure it satisfies all aspects of the problem.
