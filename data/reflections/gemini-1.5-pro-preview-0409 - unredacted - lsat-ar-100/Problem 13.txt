## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the constraint "exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday." I incorrectly assumed this meant only two witnesses could testify on Tuesday, overlooking the possibility of additional witnesses on Wednesday.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Assumption error
*   Constraint violation
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Iturbe on Wednesday:** We know Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
2.  **Franco and Hong together:** Since Franco and Hong testify on the same day and Hong cannot be on Monday, they must both be on Tuesday.
3.  **Two on Tuesday fulfilled:** With Franco and Hong on Tuesday, the "exactly two" condition for Tuesday is fulfilled. 
4.  **Garcia cannot be with Franco:** Garcia cannot be with Franco, so Garcia must be on Monday (fulfilling the "at least one witness on Monday" condition).
5.  **Jackson on Wednesday:** This leaves Jackson for Wednesday, meaning Iturbe is not the only one on Wednesday.
Therefore, **Hong must be on Tuesday (Answer D)**. 
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify all constraints:** List all conditions and limitations explicitly stated in the problem.
2.  **Start with fixed elements:** Begin with information that is definitively placed (like Iturbe on Wednesday).
3.  **Apply constraints sequentially:** Address each constraint one by one, ensuring each step adheres to all previous conditions.
4.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't assume limitations beyond what is explicitly stated (like the "exactly two" misinterpretation).
5.  **Review the final schedule:** Ensure the final arrangement satisfies all given conditions.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Read carefully:** Pay close attention to the wording of each constraint to avoid misinterpretations.
*   **Be methodical:** Approach the problem systematically, avoiding assumptions and leaps of logic.
*   **Visualize:** Consider using diagrams or tables to track the placement of elements and visualize the remaining options.
*   **Check for contradictions:** Ensure no step contradicts a previous condition or established fact. 
*   **Practice:** The more you encounter such problems, the better you'll become at identifying potential pitfalls and applying constraints accurately.
