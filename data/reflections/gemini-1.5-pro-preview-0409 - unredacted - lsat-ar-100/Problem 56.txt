## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I assumed Stuckey and Udall had to be in Zone 3 based on the given conditions. This assumption led me to incorrectly place Kim, Mahr, and Tiao in Zone 2, making choice B seem plausible. However, I overlooked the possibility of Stuckey and Udall being in Zone 1 with Parra and Quinn, which would allow Tiao to be in Zone 2 and open up Zone 3 for other possibilities.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Assumption error
*   Logic error
*   Misinterpretation of constraints 
## Solving the Problem
1. **Analyze Constraints:**
    *   Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.
    *   Zone 1 has more representatives than Zone 3 (from the question).
    *   Parra or Tiao (exclusively) is in Zone 1.
    *   Parra and Quinn are always together.
    *   Stuckey and Udall are always together.
2. **Possible Scenarios for Zone 1:**
    *   **Scenario 1:** Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1 (Tiao cannot be here).
    *   **Scenario 2:** Tiao is alone in Zone 1 (Parra and Quinn cannot be here).
3. **Analyze Scenario 1:**
    *   If Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1, then Stuckey and Udall cannot be in Zone 2 due to the constraint on Tiao and Udall. 
    *   This leaves two options:
        *   **Option 1.1:** Stuckey and Udall are in Zone 3 with one more person (Kim or Mahr). This leaves the remaining person and Tiao for Zone 2.
        *   **Option 1.2:** Stuckey and Udall are also in Zone 1 with Parra and Quinn. This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Tiao for Zones 2 and 3, with Zone 3 having one more person.
4. **Analyze Scenario 2:**
    *   If Tiao is alone in Zone 1, then Stuckey and Udall could be in Zone 2.
    *   This leaves Parra, Quinn, Kim, and Mahr for Zone 3.
5. **Evaluate Choices Based on Scenarios:**
    *   Choice A and B are possible in Option 1.1 and Scenario 2.
    *   Choice C is not possible as Parra is always with Quinn and they cannot be in Zone 3 alone.
    *   Choice D is not possible as Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 with Parra.
    *   **Choice E is possible in Option 1.2, where Udall is in Zone 1 with Parra, Quinn, and Stuckey.**
Therefore, the correct answer is **E: Udall works in Zone 3**.
