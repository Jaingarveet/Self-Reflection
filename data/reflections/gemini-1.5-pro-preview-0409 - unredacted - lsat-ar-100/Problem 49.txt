## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the constraint "The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian." I incorrectly assumed this meant the pharmacy had to be directly adjacent, overlooking the possibility of another business separating them while still fulfilling the "next to" condition.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical error
*   Constraint misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify Ends:** We need a pharmacy at one end and a restaurant at the other. Options C and D violate this, leaving A, B, and E.
2.  **Restaurant Separation:** The two restaurants need at least two businesses between them. Option D violates this, leaving A, B, and E.
3.  **Pharmacy Proximity:** The pharmacy should be next to (not necessarily directly adjacent to) the optometrist or veterinarian. Option B violates this as the toy store separates them, leaving A and E.
4.  **Toy Store Placement:** The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Option A violates this, leaving only option E as the valid arrangement.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully analyze each constraint:** Pay close attention to the wording and consider all possible interpretations.
2.  **Break down constraints:** Divide complex constraints into simpler parts for easier evaluation.
3.  **Eliminate options systematically:** Rule out choices that violate any of the constraints.
4.  **Double-check remaining options:** Ensure the final choice satisfies all constraints without exception.
