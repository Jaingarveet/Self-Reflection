## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly analyzed option A, failing to consider the requirement of selecting at least three novels. My focus was on the number of plays and the French/Russian balance, overlooking the novel requirement.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of requirements
*   Overlooking constraints
*   Incomplete analysis
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Review Requirements:**  
    *   5-6 works total
    *   Max 4 French works
    *   3-4 novels
    *   French novels ≥ Russian novels
    *   If both French plays, then no Russian play
2. **Analyze Option A:**  
    *   No Russian novels (0)
    *   2 French novels (satisfies ≥ Russian novels)
    *   2 French plays 
    *   1 Russian play (violates the rule about both French plays)
    *   Total novels = 2 (violates the 3-4 novels requirement)
3. **Conclusion:**  
    Option A violates two requirements and is therefore impossible. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully list all requirements/constraints.**
2. **Analyze each option against ALL requirements, not just a subset.**
3. **Pay close attention to numerical limits and conditional rules.**
4. **Consider edge cases and potential overlaps between requirements.**
5. **Double-check your analysis for each option before making a final decision.**
