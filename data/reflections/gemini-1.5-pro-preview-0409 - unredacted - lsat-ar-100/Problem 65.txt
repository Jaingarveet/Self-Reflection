## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the restriction on the number of botanists and zoologists. I incorrectly assumed that having two zoologists (P and R) automatically limited the selection to only one botanist. 
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical reasoning error
*   Conditional statement misapplication
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **M is selected:** This triggers the rule "If M is selected, both P and R must be selected." So, P and R are on the panel.
2.  **Zoologist requirement fulfilled:** With P and R, we have satisfied the need for at least one zoologist.
3.  **Botanist requirement:** We still need at least one botanist. The restriction "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected" is no longer relevant as we already have two zoologists. 
4.  **No restrictions on botanists:** Since the limiting condition doesn't apply, we can select any number of botanists (one, two, or three) to fulfill the requirement of having at least one botanist.
5.  **Conclusion:**  Therefore, with M, P, and R confirmed, we can also have all three botanists (F, G, and H) on the panel. This satisfies all conditions.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the given conditions and rules carefully.**
2.  **Analyze each rule's implications and triggers.**
3.  **Pay close attention to the wording of conditional statements.**
4.  **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate those that violate the rules.**
5.  **Don't make assumptions based on partial information; ensure all conditions are met.**
