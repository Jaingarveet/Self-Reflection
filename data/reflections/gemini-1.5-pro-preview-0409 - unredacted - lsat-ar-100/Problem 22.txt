## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I misinterpreted the "or else" condition in the question and the implications of selecting G and H. I focused too much on eliminating options based on individual constraints rather than considering the combined effect of multiple conditions.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of logical connectors ("or else")
*   Overlooking combined effects of multiple conditions
*   Focusing on elimination rather than positive inference
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **G and H are selected:** This implies we have two botanists, so we can have at most one zoologist (from the second condition).
2.  **F and K cannot both be selected:** This means if F is on the panel, K cannot be, and vice versa.
3.  **M with P and R:**  Since we can have at most one zoologist, selecting M is impossible because it requires both P and R.
4.  **Remaining options:** We need one chemist. Since M is out, the only remaining options are K and F (one of them must be present).
Therefore, the panel must include either F or K.
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  **Carefully analyze "or else" conditions:** Understand that it implies one of the options must be true, not necessarily both being mutually exclusive.
2.  **Consider combined effects:** Analyze how multiple conditions interact and restrict the possible selections.
3.  **Focus on positive inference:** Instead of just eliminating options, actively reason which options must be true based on the given conditions.
4.  **Review all conditions before finalizing the answer:** Ensure you haven't overlooked any constraints or their implications.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
*   **Break down complex logical statements:** Analyze each part of the statement and its implications.
*   **Create a possibility tree or table:** This can help visualize the different combinations and their validity based on the conditions.
*   **Practice with similar logic puzzles:** Improve your ability to reason through complex constraints and identify the correct solution. 
*   **Double-check your reasoning:** Ensure you haven't made any assumptions or overlooked any details.
