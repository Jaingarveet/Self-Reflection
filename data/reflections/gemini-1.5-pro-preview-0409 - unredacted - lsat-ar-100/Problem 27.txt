## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused too much on eliminating Lopez and Megregian as possibilities without considering all the given conditions. I failed to recognize that the statement "Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other" could imply that Megregian might review the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill, including Tamerlane.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Misinterpretation of conditions
*   Overlooking possibilities 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Start with the definite information:** Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
2. **Consider the "exactly two" condition:** This implies one other student must review the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill.
3. **Analyze remaining students:** 
    *   Jiang is excluded because Lopez doesn't review the same plays.
    *   Lopez is excluded because they review fewer plays than Megregian.
    *   **Megregian is the only remaining possibility and fits the condition.**
Therefore, Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill could be the students who review Tamerlane.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **List all given conditions explicitly.**
2. **Identify definite information and constraints.**
3. **Consider each condition independently and in combination.**
4. **Explore all possibilities before eliminating options.**
5. **Pay close attention to wording and logical implications.**
6. **Double-check your reasoning against all given information.**
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Approach logic problems systematically and avoid jumping to conclusions.**
*   **Break down complex conditions into smaller parts for analysis.**
*   **Consider all possibilities before making assumptions or eliminations.**
*   **Be mindful of wording nuances and their logical consequences.**
*   **Practice active reading and critical thinking to improve logical reasoning skills.**
