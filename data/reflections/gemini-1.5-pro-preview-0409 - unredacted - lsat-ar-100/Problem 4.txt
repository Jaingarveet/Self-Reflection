## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I assumed that Kevin and Rebecca being on the same day would force them both onto Thursday once Wednesday was filled. However, I failed to consider the possibility of them both being on Friday, leaving Thursday open for other assistants.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Assumption error
*   Constraint violation 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Lan not on Wednesday:** This means Olivia must be on Wednesday (due to the constraint).
2.  **Julio before Olivia:** This forces Julio to also be on Wednesday (earlier day constraint).
3.  **Wednesday filled:**  Wednesday is now full with Olivia and Julio. 
4.  **Remaining assistants:** This leaves Rebecca, Kevin, Nessa, and Lan for Thursday and Friday.
5.  **Nessa in the afternoon:**  One afternoon slot on either Thursday or Friday must be assigned to Nessa.
6.  **Kevin and Rebecca together:** This leaves one remaining afternoon slot and two morning slots on Thursday and Friday. Since Kevin and Rebecca must be on the same day, they must take the remaining afternoon and one morning slot. 
7.  **Lan's options:** Lan can take either the Thursday morning or Friday morning slot.
8.  **Thursday morning:** If Lan takes the Friday morning slot, then the Thursday morning slot must be filled by **Julio**.
Therefore, Julio must lead a Thursday session if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Identify all constraints:**  List all the given restrictions and conditions.
2.  **Analyze each constraint individually:** Understand how each constraint limits the possibilities.
3.  **Consider all possibilities:** Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions. Explore all valid options before deciding.
4.  **Eliminate options based on constraints:** Systematically rule out options that violate the given constraints.
5.  **Verify the remaining options:** Ensure the remaining options satisfy all constraints and conditions.
