## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I misinterpreted the constraint related to Nina's presentation. I assumed it meant Nina couldn't present on Wednesday, but it actually implies she can only present on Monday or Tuesday for the subsequent condition (Helen and Irving presenting the next day) to be possible. This oversight led me to eliminate the correct answer.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical Error
*   Constraint Misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Analyze Constraints:**
    *   George presents on Tuesday (eliminate options involving George for Wednesday).
    *   Olivia and Robert cannot present in the afternoon (eliminate options involving them for Wednesday as it only has afternoon slots).
    *   If Nina presents, Helen and Irving present the next day (Nina can only present on Monday or Tuesday).
2. **Evaluate Remaining Options:**
    *   Option B (Helen and Nina) is the only one that satisfies the constraints. If Nina presents on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must present on Wednesday.
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Carefully analyze each constraint and its implications.**
2. **Pay attention to conditional statements and their triggers.**
3. **Consider all possible scenarios and eliminate options that violate constraints.**
4. **Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions based on partial understanding.**
5. **Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all given information.**
