## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from misinterpreting the second rule regarding the selection of botanists and zoologists. I incorrectly assumed that having more than one botanist automatically limited the panel to only one zoologist. 
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Logical Error
*   Conditional Rule Misunderstanding
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Eliminate options without representation from each category:** This correctly eliminates options A and E.
2.  **Analyze remaining options based on botanist/zoologist rule:** 
    *   Option B does not violate the rule as it has only one zoologist (R).
    *   Option C and D both satisfy this rule. 
3.  **Apply the rule concerning M, P, and R:**
    *   Option C does not include M, so this rule is irrelevant.
    *   Option D includes M but does not include both P and R, violating the rule.
4.  **Verify remaining option against all rules:** Option C satisfies all conditions with one botanist (H), two chemists (K and L), and one zoologist (R).
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1.  **Carefully read and understand all given conditions/rules.**
2.  **Break down complex rules into simpler components.**
3.  **Apply each rule systematically to eliminate options.**
4.  **Double-check remaining options against all rules before finalizing the answer.**
5.  **Pay close attention to the logical connections between rules.** 
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Focus on accuracy over speed.**
*   **Don't make assumptions or jump to conclusions.**
*   **Consider all possibilities before eliminating options.**
*   **Practice with similar logic-based problems to improve comprehension and reasoning skills.** 
*   **If unsure, try rephrasing the rules in your own words for better understanding.**
