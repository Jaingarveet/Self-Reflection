## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My error stemmed from overlooking the constraints placed on Souza and Togowa by the given rules. While I correctly identified Young's limitation to two spaces (#2 or #3), I failed to recognize that Souza and Togowa were also restricted in their possible assignments due to their relationships with Xu and Young, respectively.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Logic error
*   Constraint oversight
*   Relationship misinterpretation 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Robertson's Constraint:** Robertson must be in one of #1-4. This leaves #5 and #6 for the remaining employees.
2. **Young's Constraint:** Young must be higher than Togowa and lower than Robertson. Since Robertson is limited to #1-4, Young can only be in **#2 or #3**.
3. **Xu's Constraint:** Xu must be higher than Souza. This means Souza cannot be in #6 (as there's no higher space) and is limited to **#1-5**.
4. **Togowa's Constraint:** Togowa must be lower than Young. Since Young can only be in #2 or #3, Togowa is limited to **#1 or #2**.
5. **Souza and Xu's Remaining Options:** With Togowa and Young potentially occupying #1 and #2, and Robertson occupying one of #1-4, Souza is further restricted to **#4 or #5**. Consequently, Xu can only be in **#5 or #6**.
Therefore, four employees (Young, Togowa, Souza, and Xu) have only two possible parking space assignments each. 
## Instructions for Future Problem Solving
1. **Identify all individual constraints:**  List each employee and their specific limitations based on the given rules.
2. **Analyze relationships between constraints:**  Understand how the limitations of one employee impact the options for others.
3. **Eliminate impossible options:**  Cross out parking spaces that become unavailable due to the established constraints.
4. **Iteratively refine possibilities:**  As you determine limitations for one employee, revisit the options for others to see if their possibilities are further reduced.
5. **Count employees with only two options:**  Once all constraints are applied, identify the number of employees with only two remaining parking space possibilities.
## General Advice for Similar Problems
*   **Visualize the problem:**  Consider using diagrams or tables to represent the relationships and constraints between elements.
*   **Work systematically:**  Avoid jumping to conclusions and instead follow a logical step-by-step process.
*   **Consider all possibilities:**  Don't overlook any potential scenarios or constraints, even if they seem unlikely at first.
*   **Review and revise:**  Double-check your reasoning and ensure you haven't missed any crucial details or made any logical errors.
