Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and imagine the scene described vividly in your mind.
2. Look for any context clues about the style and tone of the content (e.g. an action-oriented surfing video).
3. Consider each of the answer choices and visualize how they would play out on screen.
4. Favor dramatic, surprising, or eye-catching visuals over mundane ones, if they fit the context.
5. Select the answer choice that would make for the most compelling and well-edited video content, while still being plausible given the setup.
