Instructions:
1. Read the given text carefully, paying attention to tone, word choice, and formatting clues.
2. Ask yourself if the advice seems genuine and constructive, or exaggerated and tongue-in-cheek. 
3. Look for a continuation that matches the tone and style of the original text.
4. Be wary of selecting an answer choice simply because it offers more "reasonable" advice, if it doesn't fit the passage.
5. Consider the author's likely intent - are they sincerely giving advice or satirizing bad advice?
