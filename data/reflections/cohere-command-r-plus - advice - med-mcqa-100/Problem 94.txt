Advice:
- Understand the context: Recognize that certain medical terms have strong associations with specific conditions and that these associations are important in the medical field.
- Prioritize primary connections: When dealing with medical terminology, always prioritize the primary associations first and then consider differentials or less common connections.
- Cross-reference differentials cautiously: While it's important to consider differentials, be cautious about selecting them when a term has a strong, explicit association with a specific condition.
- Trust explicit medical links: Trust the explicit links between medical terms and conditions; they are often established for a reason and are widely recognized in the medical community.
