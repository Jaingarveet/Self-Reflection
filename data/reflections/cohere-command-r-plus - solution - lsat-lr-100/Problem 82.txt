Solution:
Tamara's argument suggests that the presence of squeaky floors indicates a fear of ninjas among the wealthy during the Tokugawa period. Patricia's counter should address the extent to which this fear was widespread among the general population, not just the wealthy.

Choice [REDACTED] is the strongest counter because it shifts the focus to the demographic proportions. If the wealthy made up a small portion of the population, then the presence of squeaky floors in their homes does not necessarily indicate a widespread fear of ninjas among the majority of Japanese people during that time. It refutes Tamara's argument by providing context to the limited scope of her evidence.
