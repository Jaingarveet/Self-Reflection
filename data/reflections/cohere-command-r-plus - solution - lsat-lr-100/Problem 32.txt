Solution:
The editorial presents a view that a political party's statements on education spending are inconsistent. 
The party expresses support for increasing education spending but also opposes increased spending on other occasions. 

Re-examining the answer choices: 
 - Choice 'A' focuses on the inconsistency between a legislator's statements and voting actions, which is not the main point of the editorial. 
 - Choice 'B' introduces the idea of reducing spending, which is not implied by the editorial's argument. 
 - Choice 'C' discusses the relationship between moral goals and actions, which is irrelevant to the specific issue of consistency in policy stances. 
 - Choice 'D' correctly captures the editorial's assumption. It states that a consistent policy does not dictate that an action aligned with a stated goal must always be taken. In this case, the party's position is that increasing education spending is a worthy goal, but their actions (opposing increased spending) do not necessarily align with this goal, creating an apparent inconsistency. 
 - Choice 'E' is incorrect as it denies the existence of inconsistent views within a political party, contradicting the editorial's observation.
