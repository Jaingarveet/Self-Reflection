Solution:
The statements given are: 
 - Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. 
 - Most films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international festivals. 

Statement [REDACTED] states: [REDACTED] 

While this statement is true, it does not necessarily follow from the given statements. It could be true, but it is not a definite conclusion. 

Statement [REDACTED] states: It is not true that every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. 

This statement is the correct answer because it logically follows from the given information. If most films that won at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won at international festivals, it means that there could be films that did not follow this pattern, i.e., some films that won at Lac Nichoutec did not win at international festivals.
