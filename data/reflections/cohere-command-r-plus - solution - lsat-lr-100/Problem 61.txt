Solution:
The conclusion is that at least one type of memory does not decline with age, based on the difference in the number of lapses between the two age groups. 
To establish this conclusion, it is important to consider the conditions of the experiment. 
The fact that the same group of researchers answered calls for both groups is significant because it introduces the potential for bias. 
If the researchers were expecting or hoping for a certain outcome, their presence and interaction with the callers could have influenced the results. 
This factor is least helpful in supporting the conclusion because it raises questions about the validity of the data.
