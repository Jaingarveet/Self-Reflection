Solution:
The argumentative technique employed is "conditionally advocating a factic." The technique involves presenting an accusation that is less offensive ("unyielding") while still conveying the same meaning as stronger terms like "stubborn" or "bullheaded." This is done conditionally, as it relies on the acceptance of the premise that the group members are not reaching a consensus due to their unyielding nature. By acknowledging that they have not yielded, it logically follows that they can be described as unyielding.
