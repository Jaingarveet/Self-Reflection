Solution:
The context provides information about the rate of cabin air replenishment and its relationship to carbon dioxide levels. It states that less frequent air replenishment results in higher carbon dioxide levels. 

Before 1985, cabin air was replenished every 30 minutes, which is more frequent than the current rate of once per hour. Therefore, we can infer that carbon dioxide levels were lower during a two-hour flight in 1980 than they would be during a similar flight today.
