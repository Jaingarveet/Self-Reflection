Solution:
The university president's argument is about maintaining educational quality and avoiding spending cuts. The conclusion is that aggressive marketing is necessary to achieve this goal by increasing enrollment. 

To properly draw this conclusion, we must assume that: 
- Increasing enrollment will not negatively impact educational quality (eliminating Choice A).
- Increasing enrollment will prevent the need for spending reductions (supporting Choice [REDACTED], but not the correct answer).
- Aggressive marketing will lead to increased enrollment (supporting Choice [REDACTED], but not the correct answer).

The correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], assumes that educational quality will be compromised if spending is reduced. This assumption directly addresses the argument's conclusion about maintaining quality and the relationship between spending and quality.
