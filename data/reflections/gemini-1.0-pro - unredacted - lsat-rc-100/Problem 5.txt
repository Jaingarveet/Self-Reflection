## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the overall structure of the passage and the elaboration of Dostoyevsky's position, while overlooking the specific details of how each position was presented. I mistakenly assumed that the passage elaborated on all three positions equally, when in reality, it only elaborated on Dostoyevsky's position in detail.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Overgeneralization:** I made a general statement about the elaboration of all three positions without considering the specific details of each.
* **Selective attention:** I focused on the elaboration of Dostoyevsky's position while neglecting the level of detail provided for the other two positions.
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the passage's structure and assumed that the elaboration of Dostoyevsky's position implied its superiority.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the positions presented:** The passage presents three positions on the role of art:
    * Art as standing above reality
    * Art as serving a social purpose
    * Dostoyevsky's own position
2. **Analyze the level of detail for each position:**
    * The first two positions are presented briefly and without much elaboration.
    * Dostoyevsky's position is presented in detail, with explanations of his understanding of reality, his view on the relationship between art and reality, and his definition of "artistic."
3. **Compare and contrast the positions:** The passage focuses on differentiating Dostoyevsky's position from the other two positions, highlighting his unique perspective on the role of art.
