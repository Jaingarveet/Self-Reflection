Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the passage was primarily about the use of proverbs in Mexican American communities. However, the passage is actually about the nature of proverbs in general. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in reading comprehension. 
I failed to identify the main topic of the passage and instead focused on a specific example.
Error Keywords:

Solution:
The passage defines a proverb as a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom.
The passage states that each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.
The passage concludes by stating that proverbs provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
