Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the ability to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture is independent of cultural membership. 
My error was in overlooking the importance of cultural immersion and lived experience in understanding other cultures.
Error Keywords:
 - Cultural understanding
 - Cultural immersion
 - Lived experience
Solution:
The passage criticizes the second version of multicultural education for using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures, arguing that these methods are incompatible with the values and perspectives of non-Western cultures.
Option A directly addresses this criticism by stating that adopting the perspectives and methods of a culture requires being a member of that culture. This suggests that genuine understanding of a non-Western culture can only be achieved through immersion and lived experience within that culture, rather than through the application of external methods.
Instructions:
1. Identify the main criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
2. Analyze each answer choice to determine which one directly addresses and weakens the criticism.
3. Consider the importance of cultural immersion and lived experience in understanding other cultures.
4. Choose the answer that emphasizes the limitations of external methods and the necessity of insider perspectives.
Advice:
 - Carefully analyze the passage to identify the main arguments and criticisms.
 - Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the specific criticism being addressed.
 - Consider the broader context of cultural understanding and the limitations of different approaches.
 - Choose the answer that provides the most direct and effective counterargument to the criticism.
 - Remember that genuine understanding of other cultures often requires immersion and lived experience within those cultures.
