## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the arguments presented in each passage individually, rather than identifying the underlying principle that connects them. While both passages discuss the reliability of fingerprint identification, they approach the issue from different angles. Passage A emphasizes the historical use and expert consensus surrounding the technique, while Passage B highlights the lack of objective standards and the unknown error rate. 
**Error Keywords:**
* **Oversimplification:** I oversimplified the arguments by focusing on individual points instead of the overarching principle.
* **Lack of critical analysis:** I failed to critically analyze the arguments and identify the common thread.
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the focus of Passage A, mistaking its emphasis on historical use for an argument based solely on scientific proof.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the key arguments in each passage:** 
    * Passage A: Fingerprint identification is reliable due to its long history and expert consensus.
    * Passage B: Fingerprint identification lacks reliability due to the absence of objective standards and unknown error rate.
2. **Look for the underlying principle:** Both passages, despite their opposing viewpoints, share the underlying principle that the reliability of fingerprint identification must be scientifically proven.
3. **Choose the answer that reflects this principle:** Option E, "Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable," directly addresses this principle.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. **Read each passage carefully and identify the main arguments.**
2. **Look for common threads or underlying principles that connect the arguments.**
3. **Do not focus solely on individual points or details.**
4. **Critically analyze the arguments and consider potential biases or limitations.**
5. **Choose the answer that best reflects the overall message or principle conveyed by both passages.**
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* **Pay attention to keywords and phrases that indicate underlying principles.**
* **Consider the context and purpose of the passages.**
* **Do not rush to judgment; take your time to analyze the information thoroughly.**
* **If unsure, choose the answer that reflects a more cautious or critical approach.**
* **Remember that legal reasoning often involves balancing different perspectives and arguments.**
