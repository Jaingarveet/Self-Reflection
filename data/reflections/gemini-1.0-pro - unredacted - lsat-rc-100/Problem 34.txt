Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the point of disagreement between the authors. 
While both passages discuss the reliability of fingerprint identification, their primary disagreement centers on the likelihood of error in individual cases.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of author disagreement
 - Focus on general reliability instead of specific error rates
Solution:
Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has a low error rate and is reliable.
Passage B argues that fingerprint identification lacks objective standards and has a high error rate.
The authors disagree about the likelihood of a fingerprint examiner incorrectly declaring a match in a given criminal case.
