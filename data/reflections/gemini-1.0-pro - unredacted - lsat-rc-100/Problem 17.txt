## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial answer was incorrect because I focused solely on the chemical transmission of signals between neurons, neglecting the crucial role of receptors in mediating this process. I overlooked the passage's emphasis on the structure and function of receptors, particularly their ability to convert chemical signals into electrical activity.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Focus error:** Concentrating on one aspect (chemical transmission) while neglecting another (receptor function).
* **Omission error:** Failing to consider a significant element (receptor-mediated conversion).
* **Interpretation error:** Misunderstanding the passage's emphasis on the combined role of chemicals and receptors.
## Solution and Instructions
**Step 1:** Identify the main topic: the mechanism of signal transmission in the brain.
**Step 2:** Analyze the passage's structure:
* **Paragraph 1:** Introduces the shift from electrical to chemical transmission theories.
* **Paragraph 2:** Explains the chemical transmission process and the role of neurotransmitters.
* **Paragraph 3:** Discusses the skepticism surrounding the chemical theory and the lack of understanding of the mechanism.
* **Paragraph 4:** Presents evidence for the role of receptors in mediating chemical-to-electrical conversion.
* **Paragraph 5:** Describes the structure and function of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
* **Paragraph 6:** Highlights the discovery of different receptor varieties and its medical significance.
**Step 3:** Summarize the key points:
* Chemical transmission is the accepted mechanism for inter-neuronal communication.
* Neurotransmitters bind to receptors, triggering a change in receptor shape and opening of ion channels.
* Different receptor varieties exist, offering potential for targeted drug development.
**Step 4:** Choose the answer that best reflects these points:
**Answer (D):** Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
