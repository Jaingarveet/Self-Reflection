 Explanation:
I correctly answered the question by recognizing that A has traveled a total distance of 3 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 13 km from home.

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution:
A has traveled a total distance of 3 km to the south, then 5 km to the east, then 3 km to the north, and finally 2 km to the west. To find the final distance from home, we need to add up all the distances traveled: 3 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 13 km.

Instructions:

1. Identify the direction of travel (south, east, north, or west).
2. Calculate the distance traveled in that direction (3 km, 5 km, 3 km, or 2 km).
3. Add up the distances traveled in all directions to find the total distance from home.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the distance traveled can be calculated by adding up the distances in each direction.
