 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation, leading me to choose the incorrect answer. Here's what went wrong:

Thought:
I correctly identified the information given in the problem, but I made a mistake in my assumption. I assumed that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is x. However, the correct assumption should have been that the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 30, since 30 of the books are hardcover and 20 are fiction.

Solution:
Using the correct assumption, we can solve for the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction:

Total number of books = 45
Number of hardcover books = 30
Number of fiction books = 20

Maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction = Total number of books - (Number of hardcover books + Number of fiction books)
= 45 - (30 + 20)
= 45 - 50
= -5

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 0.
