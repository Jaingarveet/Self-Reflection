 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation, which led me to choose the incorrect answer.

The correct solution is as follows:

Let the man's rate in still water be x kmph. Then, the distance he covers in 1 hour in still water is x km.

Now, the current is flowing at a rate of 2 kmph, so the distance he covers against the current in 1 hour is x + 2 km.

We want to find the man's rate along the current, so we need to find the distance he covers in 1 hour along the current. This is the difference between the distance he covers in 1 hour against the current and the distance he covers in 1 hour in still water:

Distance along the current = Distance against the current - Distance in still water
= x + 2 - x
= 2

So, the man's rate along the current is 2 kmph.

The correct answer is (E) 6 kmph.
