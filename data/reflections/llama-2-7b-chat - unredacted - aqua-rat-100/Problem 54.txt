  Explanation:

We are given the following information in the problem:

* Silu weighs 51 kg.
* Meenu weighs 29 kg + half of her weight.

We need to find Meenu's weight.

Let's use the information given in the problem to find Meenu's weight:

Meenu's weight = 29 kg + (1/2)x

where x is Meenu's weight.

We know that Silu's weight is 51 kg, so Meenu's weight is half of Silu's weight plus 29 kg:

Meenu's weight = 51 kg / 2 = 25.5 kg + 29 kg = 54.5 kg

Therefore, Meenu weighs 54.5 kg.

The correct answer is (D) 54.5 kg.
