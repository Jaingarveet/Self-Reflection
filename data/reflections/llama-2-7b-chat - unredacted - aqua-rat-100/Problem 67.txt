  Great job! You correctly analyzed the information given in the question and arrived at the correct answer. Here's a breakdown of your thought process and the steps you took to solve the problem:

1. You recognized that the problem involved comparing the amount of falafel in different types of bread, and you decided to use the information given in the question to help you solve the problem.
2. You correctly interpreted the first sentence of the problem, which stated that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls. You recognized that this meant that if one pita bread contains X falafel, then two rolls contain 2X falafel.
3. You then used the second sentence of the problem to help you solve the problem. You recognized that three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, which means that if one roll contains X falafel, then five baguettes contain 5X falafel.
4. You then used the information you had gathered to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. You recognized that two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as one pita bread, so if five baguettes contain 5X falafel, then two baguettes contain 5X/2 = 2.5X falafel.
5. Finally, you arrived at the answer to the problem by dividing the total amount of falafel in five baguettes by the amount of falafel in each baguette, which gave you 2.5X = 25/3 = 8.33 pita breads.

Great job! Your thought process and steps were clear and well-organized, and you arrived at the correct answer. Keep up the good work!
