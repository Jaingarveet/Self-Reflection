  Thank you for providing the feedback. I understand now that I need to provide my answer in the correct format. Here is my revised response:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is (D) 65000.

Explanation:
To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to count the number of possible combinations.

Let's consider the letters of the alphabet as A, B, C, D, E, and F. Each letter can be used once or twice, so there are 5 letters in total.

Now, let's count the number of possible combinations of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers:

* AA: 2 combinations (A and B, A and E)
* AB: 3 combinations (A and B, A and D, A and F)
* AC: 3 combinations (A and C, A and D, A and E)
* AD: 2 combinations (A and D, A and F)
* AE: 2 combinations (A and E, A and F)
* AF: 1 combination (A and F)
* BA: 2 combinations (B and A, B and E)
* BB: 2 combinations (B and B, B and F)
* BC: 3 combinations (B and C, B and D, B and E)
* BD: 2 combinations (B and D, B and F)
* BE: 3 combinations (B and E, B and D, B and F)
*BF: 2 combinations (B and F, B and E)

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is:

7 x 6 = 42

So, the answer is (D) 65000.
