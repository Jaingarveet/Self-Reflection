 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation, leading me to choose the incorrect answer.

The correct solution is as follows:

The perimeter of the original rectangle is indeed 54 cm. Since the wire is being rebent to form a square, the length and breadth of the square will be equal. Therefore, the length of each side of the square is half of the length of the original rectangle, which is 27 cm / 2 = 13.5 cm.

So, the correct answer is (C) 13.5 cm.
