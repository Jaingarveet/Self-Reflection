 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. I calculated the percentage of profit and loss incorrectly.

The correct calculation for the percentage of profit and loss is as follows:

Profit = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price
= (25.75 - 27.50) / 27.50
= 5% Profit

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 3% Profit.
