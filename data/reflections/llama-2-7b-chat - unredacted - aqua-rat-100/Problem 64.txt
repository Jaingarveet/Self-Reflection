 Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my answer. I incorrectly calculated the age of the brother.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Time passage error
Solution:
When the person was 2 years old, their brother was half their age, which means their brother was 2 years old.
Now, 60 years have passed, and the person is 60 + 2 = 62 years old.
So, their brother is now 62 - 2 = 60 years old.
Instructions:
1. Identify the age of the person when their brother was half their age.
2. Calculate the number of years that have passed since the person was 2 years old.
3. Subtract the number of years that have passed from the current age of the person to find the age of the brother.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the passage of time can affect the age of individuals, so be sure to account for it in your calculations.
