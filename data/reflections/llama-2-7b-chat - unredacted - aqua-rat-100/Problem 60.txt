 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I misunderstood the question and overlooked an important detail.

The correct solution is:

If B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BD.

In this case, the measure of minor arc AC is 160°, and the measure of minor arc BD is 150°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is:

AD = AC - BD = 160° - 150° = 10°

So, the correct answer is (B) 10°.
