 Explanation:
I made a calculation error in my previous answer. I misunderstood the information provided in the question and made an incorrect assumption about the train's speed after it started raining.

The correct calculation for the total journey duration is as follows:

1. The train covers the first quarter of the distance at a speed of 100 miles/hour, which means it covers 25% of the total distance in 10 hours (since the train runs at a speed of 100 miles/hour for 10 hours).
2. After covering a quarter of the distance, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour, which means it covers the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.
3. The total distance traveled by the train is half of the total distance, which is equal to the distance traveled before the rain plus the distance traveled after the rain.
4. The distance traveled before the rain is equal to the distance traveled in the first 10 hours (25% of the total distance).
5. The distance traveled after the rain is equal to the remaining distance (50% of the total distance).

Therefore, the total journey duration is:

10 hours (distance traveled in the first 10 hours) + 5 hours (distance traveled after the rain) = 15 hours

So, the correct answer is (C) 15 hours.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the information provided in the question

* Calculation error in determining the total distance traveled by the train

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Use the information provided in the question to determine the train's speed after it started raining.
* Consider the distance traveled before and after the rain when calculating the total journey duration.
