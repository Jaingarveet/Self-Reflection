 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. The correct answer is (D) 10.

The reasoning is as follows:

Each type of book can be represented by a single letter or a pair of letters. Since there are 10 types of books, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 10.

I apologize for my mistake in the previous answer. Thank you for pointing it out.
