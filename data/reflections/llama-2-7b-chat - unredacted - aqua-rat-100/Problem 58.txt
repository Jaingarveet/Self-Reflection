 Explanation:
You are correct! The two balls will be at the same starting point again in 385 minutes. Great job!

Here's a breakdown of how you arrived at the correct answer:

1. You identified the problem as a timing problem and recognized that you needed to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the time taken by ball A to make one full rotation and the time taken by ball B to make one full rotation.
2. You calculated the time taken by ball A to make one full rotation to be 52 minutes.
3. You calculated the time taken by ball B to make one full rotation to be 175 minutes.
4. You found the least common multiple (LCM) of 52 minutes and 175 minutes to be 385 minutes.
5. You concluded that the two balls will be at the same starting point again in 385 minutes.

Well done! Here are some tips to help you with similar problems in the future:

1. Always read the question carefully and identify the problem.
2. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and tackle each one step-by-step.
3. Use visual aids or diagrams to help you visualize the problem and find the solution.
4. Check your calculations carefully and double-check your work.
5. Use the least common multiple (LCM) formula to find the time when the two objects will be at the same starting point again.

Keep practicing, and you'll become a math whiz in no time!
