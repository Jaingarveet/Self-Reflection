Solution:
The given information describes the vertical motion of the space shuttle, not its horizontal motion. 
Therefore, the given speed is the vertical speed, not the horizontal speed.
The length of the space shuttle is related to its horizontal speed, not its vertical speed.
Since we don't have information about the horizontal speed, we cannot determine the length of the space shuttle.
