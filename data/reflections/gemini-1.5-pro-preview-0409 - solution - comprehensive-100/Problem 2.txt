Solution:
Each picket is 0.5 inches wide, and each space is 6 inches wide.
So, each picket-space unit is 0.5 + 6 = 6.5 inches.
With x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces between them. 
Therefore, the total number of picket-space units is x + (x-1) = 2x-1.
The total length of the fence in inches is 6.5 * (2x-1) = 13x - 6.5 inches.
Converting to feet by dividing by 12, we get (13x - 6.5) / 12 = (13x - 13/2) / 12 = (26x - 13) / 24 = (13x - 12)/24 feet.
