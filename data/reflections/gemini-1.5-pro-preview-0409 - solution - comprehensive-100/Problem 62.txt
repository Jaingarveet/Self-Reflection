Solution:
Following the initial steps correctly:
1. We multiplied the second equation by 3 to eliminate x:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\ 6 y-3 x=-57\end{array}$$
2. We added the two equations together: 
$$10y = -80$$
3. We solved for y:
$$y = -8$$
4. Now, substitute y = -8 back into the first equation:
$$3x + 4(-8) = -23$$
5. Solve for x, paying close attention to the signs:
$$3x - 32 = -23$$
$$3x = 9$$
$$x = 3$$
Therefore, the correct solution is (3, -8).
