Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the new predator would target the larger and stronger sheep with dark wool. However, the question states that the sheep with light wool have increased in number in the last 20 years. This suggests that the sheep with light wool have a survival advantage, possibly due to their agility or camouflage.
