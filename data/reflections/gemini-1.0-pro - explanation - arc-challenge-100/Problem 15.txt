Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I confused the concept of a mixture with a compound. 
I correctly identified that a mixture is made up of more than one substance, but I mistakenly stated that the components of a mixture do not retain their original properties. 
This is incorrect; the components of a mixture retain their original properties and can be separated by physical means.
