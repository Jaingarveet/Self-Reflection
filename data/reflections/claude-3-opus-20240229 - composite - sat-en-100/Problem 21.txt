Explanation:
I misinterpreted the main point of the passage. While the passage does mention territorial expansion, its central argument is that the current Constitutional structure, allowing for both free and slave states, is fundamentally sound and does not need to be altered. The author is directly refuting Lincoln's claim that a nation divided into free and slave states "cannot stand."
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting main idea
 - Focusing on minor detail
 - Overlooking explicit statements
 - Reading comprehension error
Solution:
The passage makes the following key points about the Constitution's provisions for slavery:
1. The Constitution has allowed the nation to grow and prosper, even with the division into free and slave states. This refutes Lincoln's claim that such a division is unsustainable.
2. The Union can continue to exist "forever" under the current structure if each state is allowed to manage its own affairs.
3. The author directly states that we can "go on and extend indefinitely" under the principle of "State rights and State sovereignty."
These points all support the idea that the Constitution's current provisions for slavery are a good basic structure that does not need to be changed (C). The author argues the current system has worked well and can continue to work going forward.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully, focusing on the author's central argument or thesis.
2. Identify explicit statements that directly answer the question.
3. Analyze how supporting details connect to and reinforce the main idea.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not supported by the passage.
5. Select the answer choice that best encapsulates the author's main point as it relates to the question.
Advice:
 - Always read carefully to identify the main idea, not just isolated details.
 - Focus on what the author states explicitly, not just what is implied.
 - Make sure your answer is supported by direct textual evidence.
 - Don't be swayed by peripheral details that don't address the central point.
 - Eliminate answers that are too extreme or absolute if not supported by the passage.
