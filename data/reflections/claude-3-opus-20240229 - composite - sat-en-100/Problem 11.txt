Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the missing value in the last row of the table meant there was not enough information to answer the question. However, upon re-examining the table, I realize that the value can be inferred from the other data provided.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting tabular data
 - Overlooking implicit information
 - Failing to synthesize data
 - Jumping to conclusions
Solution:
Looking at the data for colonies with colony collapse disorder:
- 100% were infected by the KBV virus
- 100% were infected by the Nosema apis fungus
- 90% were infected by the IAPV virus 
- 77% were infected by the Nosema ceranae fungus
For all four pathogens to be present, the limiting factor is the pathogen with the lowest percentage, which is Nosema ceranae at 77%.
Therefore, 77% of colonies with colony collapse disorder must have been infected by all four pathogens. This matches with answer choice [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand what specific information is being asked for.
2. Examine the data table, noting the row and column headers to orient yourself.
3. If a direct answer is not available, look for implicit information that can help you infer the answer.
4. Identify the relevant data points needed to answer the question.
5. Synthesize the individual data points logically to arrive at a conclusion.
6. If a percentage for combined criteria is asked for, the limiting factor is the lowest individual percentage.
7. Select the answer choice that matches your conclusion based on the data.
Advice:
 - Always read questions carefully to ensure you are finding the right data to answer the specific question asked.
 - Don't just look for explicit answers; use the given data to infer or calculate implicit answers.
 - With combined criteria like "all" or "and", the limiting factor is the smallest individual percentage.
 - If data seems to be missing, look for clues in the surrounding data that could help fill in the gap.
 - Practice active reading of data tables, graphs and passages to improve extraction of key information.
