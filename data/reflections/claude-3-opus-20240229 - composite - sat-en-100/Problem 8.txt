Explanation:
I misread the data in the table. I looked at the "Colonies without colony collapse disorder" column, but I chose the pathogen with the highest percentage in that column ([REDACTED] at 81%). However, the question asked about colonies without colony collapse disorder, so I should have looked at the "Colonies with colony collapse disorder" column instead.
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the question
 - Misinterpreting data
 - Selecting data from the wrong category
 - Inattention to key details
Solution:
To determine which pathogen infected the highest percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder, I'll look at the "Colonies with colony collapse disorder (%)" column and find the highest value:
IAPV: 83%
KBV: 100%
[REDACTED]: 100%
[REDACTED]: 77%
Both KBV and [REDACTED] have the highest percentage at 100%. However, the question asks for a single pathogen, so either KBV or [REDACTED] could be chosen as the correct answer. The answer key indicates that [REDACTED] is considered the correct answer, even though it has a lower percentage than KBV and [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to determine what information you need to find.
2. Identify the relevant data table or figure.
3. Determine which row(s) and column(s) contain the data needed to answer the question.
4. Read the data from the appropriate cell(s) in the table or figure.
5. If comparing data, identify the highest or lowest value as specified in the question.
6. Select the answer choice that matches the data you found.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully to identify exactly what information you need to answer it.
 - Pay close attention to the specific wording of the question, as small details can change the meaning.
 - When working with tables or figures, take time to orient yourself and understand what data is shown in each row and column.
 - Be careful not to mix up similar-sounding row or column labels.
 - Double-check that you are looking at the correct row(s) and column(s) before reading any data values.
 - If the correct answer is not obvious based on the data, re-read the question to make sure you are answering what is actually being asked.
