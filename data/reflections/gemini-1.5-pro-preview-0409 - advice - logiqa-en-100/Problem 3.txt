Advice:
- Look beyond the surface meaning of the text and consider the implied meanings and consequences.
- Pay attention to conditional statements and the relationships they establish.
- When dealing with cause-and-effect reasoning, ensure the option chosen reflects both the cause and the guaranteed effect. 
- Be mindful of strong wording like "definitely" and assess if the context supports such definitive claims.
