Solution:
To care for your skin while traveling, it's important to pack the basic products you use every day. Consider mentally going through your day and thinking about when and where you use skin products. Bring your usual hygiene products like toothbrush, toothpaste, antiperspirant, sunscreen, moisturizer, and SPF. It's better to bring your own products than to rely on drugstore purchases, especially if you have sensitive skin. Don't forget to pack an appropriate makeup or toiletry bag.
