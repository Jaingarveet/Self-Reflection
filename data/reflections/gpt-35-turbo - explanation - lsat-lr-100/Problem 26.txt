Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which states that any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. This statement is too broad and not supported by the passage. The passage only states that horror stories, which describe violations of the laws of nature, are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which states that some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. This statement is true based on the passage, which states that horror stories about monstrous beasts may symbolize a psychological disturbance in the protagonist.
