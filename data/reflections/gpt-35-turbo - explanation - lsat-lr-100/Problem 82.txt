Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not focus on the main point of Tamara's objection. Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house. Answer [REDACTED] does not address this point. Answer [REDACTED] is the strongest counter because it points out that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which means that the majority of Japanese did not fear ninjas.
