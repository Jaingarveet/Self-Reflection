Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was about the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline. However, the argument was about the failure of the argument for freedom of thought. 
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument structure and the conclusion. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it supports the idea that societies that protect freedom of thought may lack intellectual discipline, which is necessary for intellectual progress.
