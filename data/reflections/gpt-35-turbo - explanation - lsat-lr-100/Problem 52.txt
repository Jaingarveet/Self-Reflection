Explanation:
I chose answer choice [REDACTED] because it presents an alternative reason for why a tire may wear out prematurely. However, the flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is that it assumes a necessary condition is also a sufficient condition. Specifically, the argument assumes that the only reason a bird feeder will not attract many birds is that it lacks a protective cover. Answer choice [REDACTED] has the same flawed pattern of reasoning. It assumes that the only reason a tire will wear out prematurely is that the car owner neglects to check the tire pressure regularly.
