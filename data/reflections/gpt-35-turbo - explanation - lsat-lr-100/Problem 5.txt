Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the answer to the question. Option [REDACTED] does not help to resolve the discrepancy between the increase in the number of tornadoes and the unchanged climatic factors affecting their creation. 
The correct answer is option [REDACTED] because it provides a possible explanation for the increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually. The increase in the number of citizens helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953 could explain the increase in the number of tornadoes recorded annually.
