Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because it emphasizes the prevention of any further environmental damage and does not allow for different degrees of harm already done by different nations. However, this principle does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position because it does not address the issue of Figoria's right to govern its own resources. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it supports the Figorian Development Commission's position by suggesting that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found. This principle implies that Figoria should be allowed to develop wetlands for growth unless there is evidence that endangered species are being harmed.
