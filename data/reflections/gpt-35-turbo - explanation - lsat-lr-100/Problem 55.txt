Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the answer. Option [REDACTED] states that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. However, this assumption does not enable the conclusion to be properly drawn because it does not support the idea that Tolstoy's claim is rash. The correct answer is option [REDACTED], which states that we can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. This assumption enables the conclusion to be properly drawn because it supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action. If we do not regard an action as freely performed, then we cannot praise or blame a person for that action, regardless of how much information we possess about the events that led to it.
