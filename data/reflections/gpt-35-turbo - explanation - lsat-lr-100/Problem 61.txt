Explanation:
I incorrectly identified option [REDACTED] as the least helpful in establishing the conclusion. However, option [REDACTED] is the least helpful because it does not relate to memory or the ability to remember to make a telephone call at a specified time. 
My error was in not carefully considering each option and its relevance to the conclusion.
