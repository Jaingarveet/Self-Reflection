Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the assumption on which the argument depends. The correct answer is [REDACTED]. The argument is that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The assumption on which the argument depends is that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are more accurate than the perceptions of persons who do not know that language. Option [REDACTED] correctly captures this assumption.
