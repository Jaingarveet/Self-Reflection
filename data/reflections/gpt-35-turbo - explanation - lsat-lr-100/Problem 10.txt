Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which states that it is not wrong to use someone's property without their permission if they have used your property without your permission. However, this principle does not directly support Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer without his permission. Answer choice [REDACTED], on the other hand, states that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. This principle directly supports Mike's reasoning that it would not be wrong for him to use Tom's computer without his permission because Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission.
