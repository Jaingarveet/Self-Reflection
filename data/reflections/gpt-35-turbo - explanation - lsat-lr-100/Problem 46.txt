Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is irrelevant to the archaeologist's argument. The archaeologist is concerned about the potential for future archaeologists to be misled by the absence of the mosaics, not about the potential for misleading interpretations of the site due to the removal of artifacts. The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument that the decision to remove the mosaics should have been based solely on archaeological considerations.
