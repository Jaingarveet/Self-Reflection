Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which states that the journalist assumes that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. However, the journalist's argument is more specific than that; it assumes that the physician who critiqued the book is biased because he is employed by the company that manufactures the drug. Answer choice [REDACTED] correctly identifies this vulnerability in the journalist's argument.
