Explanation:
I chose answer choice [REDACTED], which suggests that the argument overlooks the possibility that crying might reduce emotional stress due to something other than the shedding of tears. However, the argument does not assume that shedding tears is the only factor that reduces emotional stress. Therefore, answer choice [REDACTED] is incorrect. 
The argument assumes that the presence of certain hormones in tears is the cause of reduced emotional stress. However, the presence of these hormones does not necessarily mean that they are the cause of reduced emotional stress. Therefore, answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
