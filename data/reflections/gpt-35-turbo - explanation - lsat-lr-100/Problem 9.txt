Explanation:
I misinterpreted the argument and chose an option that was not relevant to the argument. 
The argument is that exposure to heavy metals in sewage sludge has promoted bacteria's resistance to antibiotics. 
Option [REDACTED] is not relevant to the argument. 
Option [REDACTED] supports the argument by stating that bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.
