Explanation:
I chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is incorrect. The argument does not assume that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable. Instead, it claims that those responsible for technological advances are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because the argument assumes that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome. This is not necessarily true, as people may unintentionally produce outcomes that they did not desire.
