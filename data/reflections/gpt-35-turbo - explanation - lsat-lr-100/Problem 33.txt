Explanation:
I chose option [REDACTED] as the answer, which is incorrect. Option [REDACTED] is irrelevant to the conclusion drawn from the experiment. The variation in the specific causes of chronic back pain could have affected the results of the experiment, but it does not counter the physician's argument that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. 
The correct answer is option [REDACTED]. If a patient's improvement in condition could be due to the placebo effect, then the experiment's results are not reliable, and the conclusion drawn from the experiment is weakened.
