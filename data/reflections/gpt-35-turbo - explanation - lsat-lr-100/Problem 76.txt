Explanation:
I chose answer choice [REDACTED] because it presents a dilemma where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many species but also reduces the proliferation of other species. However, the argument in the question is about a dilemma where universal adoption of a healthier diet would lead to the extinction of marine species. Answer choice [REDACTED] presents a similar dilemma where a consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
