Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider the conclusion of the argument carefully. The conclusion is that no one should take "love" in this context to be referring to feelings. The assumption that would make this conclusion follow logically is that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], not [REDACTED].
