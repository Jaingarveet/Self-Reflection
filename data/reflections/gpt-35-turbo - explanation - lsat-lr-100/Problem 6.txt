Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument was about the minimum level of information that a gardening book should provide about composting. The argument is about the difference between hot and cold composting. The author assumes that any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain the difference between hot and cold composting.
