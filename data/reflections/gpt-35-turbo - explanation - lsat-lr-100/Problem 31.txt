Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not identify the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims. Instead, I focused on finding an option that explains how new recycling projects could be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage. 
The apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims is that the mayor claims that new recycling projects could greatly reduce the amount of garbage that the city must dispose of, but also claims that these projects would be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage. 
Option [REDACTED] does not resolve this inconsistency, but rather provides a reason why the city must incinerate much of its garbage.
