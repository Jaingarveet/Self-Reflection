Explanation:
I made an assumption about the completion of the text based on my knowledge of making lemonade, but I did not consider the context of the given text.
The gap in my knowledge was not in common sense but in reading comprehension.
I knew the process of making lemonade but did not pay attention to the details in the text.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Reading comprehension error

Solution:
The text describes the process of making lemonade, specifically the step of pouring hot water over lemons in glasses and stirring them.
The text does not mention adding ice or pouring the lemonade into glasses.
The most likely completion of the text would be to describe what happens to the glasses after they are stirred.
The correct answer is "[REDACTED]"
