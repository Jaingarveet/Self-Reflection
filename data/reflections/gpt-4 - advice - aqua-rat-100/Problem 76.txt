Advice:
- Always double-check your simplifications in algebraic expressions.
- Be careful when calculating ranges based on inequalities.
- Always verify your answer by substitifying the boundary values of the range into the simplified expression.
- If none of the options fully cover the calculated range, choose the option that best fits the range.
