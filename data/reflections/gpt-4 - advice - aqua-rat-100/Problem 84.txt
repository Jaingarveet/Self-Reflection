Advice:
- Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
- Be careful with problems involving arrangements or combinations, as they can be tricky.
- Remember that if objects (like chairs) are identical, the specific object each item is placed on does not matter, only their order.
- Always double-check your understanding of the problem and your final answer.
