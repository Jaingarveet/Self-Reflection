## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the aspect of fairness between nations in resource usage, neglecting the core argument about the impact of development on wildlife. Option D, while seemingly relevant to fairness, doesn't directly address the central issue of whether development should be allowed based on its potential harm to endangered species.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on irrelevant detail
*   Neglecting the central issue 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the core argument:** The central disagreement is whether wetland development should be allowed despite potential harm to endangered species.
2.  **Analyze each option's relevance to the core argument:**
    *   Options A, B, and E are irrelevant as they don't address the conditions for allowing development.
    *   Option D focuses on fairness between nations but doesn't address the impact on wildlife.
    *   **Option C directly addresses the condition for regulation, stating it should only occur when harm to endangered species is proven.**
3.  **Choose the option that aligns with the Development Commission's position:** Option C supports their stance by suggesting development should be allowed until harm is demonstrated.
