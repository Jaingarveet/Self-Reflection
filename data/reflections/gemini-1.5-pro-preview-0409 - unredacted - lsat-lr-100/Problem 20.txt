## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the aspect of ignorance of the law rather than the specific relationship between national and local building codes. The judge's statement implies a hierarchy where compliance with national codes automatically ensures compliance with local codes.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of context
*   Focus on irrelevant principle 
*   Ignoring hierarchical relationship between laws
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the Judge's Statement:** The judge emphasizes that the defendant's excuse might be valid for local code violations but not for national code violations.
2.  **Identify the Underlying Principle:** This implies a relationship where adherence to national codes guarantees adherence to local codes, suggesting a hierarchical structure.
3.  **Match with Answer Choices:** Option C, "Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes," directly reflects this hierarchical relationship and justifies the judge's reasoning.
