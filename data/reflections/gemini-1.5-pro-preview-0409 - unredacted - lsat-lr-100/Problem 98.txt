## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly focused on the assumption that commercially viable technology cannot benefit society. While this assumption is flawed, it is not the main weakness of the argument. The core issue lies in the argument's presumption that actions not explicitly motivated by societal benefit cannot lead to such benefits.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on secondary issue
*   Ignoring core assumption
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** Technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society.
2.  **Identify the Premise:** Individuals responsible for technological advancements are motivated by personal gain, not societal benefit.
3.  **Analyze the Gap:** The argument assumes that actions motivated by personal gain cannot result in societal benefits. This is a flawed assumption because actions can have unintended positive consequences.
