## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My focus on the variability of allergic reactions led me to overlook the more direct statement about the cause – the differing proteins in cats. Option B, while related, is more of an implication of the varying proteins rather than a direct statement about them.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on implication over direct cause
*   Overlooking key information
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the central theme:** The passage focuses on the variability of allergens (proteins) in cats and the resulting individual allergic responses.
2.  **Analyze each option:**
    *   A: This is not supported as the passage doesn't discuss breed-specific allergens.
    *   B: This is an implication of the varying proteins but not a direct statement about them.
    *   **C: This directly addresses the core point – cats differ in their protein composition.**
    *   D: The passage doesn't compare the intensity of allergic reactions.
    *   E: While predictability is complex, the passage doesn't explicitly make this claim.
3.  **Choose the best option:** Option C aligns most directly with the passage's main point about the variability of proteins in cats. 
## Future Instructions
1.  **Identify the main point of the passage.**
2.  **Focus on direct statements and causes rather than implications or correlations.**
3.  **Analyze each option in relation to the passage's central theme.**
4.  **Eliminate options that are not directly supported or are irrelevant.**
5.  **Choose the option that best reflects the passage's main point.**
## General Advice
*   **Read the passage carefully and identify the key points and supporting details.**
*   **Pay attention to the specific wording of the question and options.**
*   **Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not directly supported by the passage.**
*   **Consider all options before making a final decision.**
*   **Practice actively analyzing passages and answering questions to improve comprehension and critical thinking skills.**
