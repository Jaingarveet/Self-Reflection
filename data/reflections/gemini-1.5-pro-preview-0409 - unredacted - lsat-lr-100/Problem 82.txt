## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was too narrow, focusing only on the ninja's ability to circumvent squeaky floors. I failed to consider the broader context and the implication of Tamara's statement regarding the prevalence of ninja threats.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Narrow focus
*   Ignoring context
*   Missing implication 
*   Assumption error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Tamara's Claim:** Tamara implies that ninja threats were common enough to warrant widespread architectural countermeasures (squeaky floors) among wealthy Japanese.
2.  **Identify Counter-Argument Strategy:** To counter this, Patricia needs to undermine the assumption of widespread ninja threats.
3.  **Evaluate Options:**
    *   **Option C** directly addresses this by stating that the wealthy were a small portion of the population. This implies that even if all wealthy people had squeaky floors, it wouldn't represent a significant portion of the population, thus weakening the claim of widespread fear of ninjas.

## General Advice
*   **Think Critically:** Don't accept statements at face value; analyze their underlying logic and implications.
