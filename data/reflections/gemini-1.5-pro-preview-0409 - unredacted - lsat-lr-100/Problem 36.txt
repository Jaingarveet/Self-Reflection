## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the difference in perception between native and non-native speakers, assuming the non-native perception was more accurate. However, the argument's core is that **both** perceptions are subjective and potentially inaccurate representations of the actual sound.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Assumption identification error
*   Focus on difference, not commonality
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the Conclusion:** The argument concludes that the perception of sentences as separate words is an illusion.
2.  **Analyze the Reasoning:** The reasoning contrasts native speakers (hearing distinct words) with non-native speakers (hearing an uninterrupted stream).
3.  **Identify the Assumption:** The argument assumes that neither perception is necessarily more accurate than the other, both being subjective interpretations.
Therefore, the correct answer is **E: Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.**
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the Conclusion and Evidence:** Clearly understand the argument's main point and the supporting evidence.
2.  **Focus on the Gap:** Identify the unstated assumption that bridges the gap between evidence and conclusion.
3.  **Consider Alternative Perspectives:** Don't assume one perspective is inherently more accurate; consider the subjectivity of perception.
4.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** Eliminate options that don't address the gap or introduce irrelevant information.
## General Advice for Assumption Identification
*   **Read Carefully:** Pay close attention to the nuances of the argument and avoid jumping to conclusions.
*   **Question Assumptions:** Actively challenge the unstated assumptions underlying the reasoning.
*   **Consider Multiple Perspectives:** Recognize that different individuals may have varying interpretations of the same information.
*   **Practice:** Regularly engage with assumption identification exercises to improve your analytical skills.
