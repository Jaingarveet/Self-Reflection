## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My error stemmed from focusing on the specific example of inconsistency presented (education spending) rather than the general principle of consistency in political policy. I failed to recognize that the editorial's argument hinges on the idea that a consistent policy wouldn't advocate against actions that achieve worthy goals.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on specific example instead of general principle
*   Failure to identify underlying assumption
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the conclusion:** The editorial concludes that the political party's policy is inconsistent.
2.  **Analyze the reasoning:** The reasoning is based on the party supporting both increased and decreased spending on education.
3.  **Identify the assumption:** The argument assumes that a consistent policy wouldn't advocate against actions (reducing spending) that achieve worthy goals (improving education). 
4.  **Match the assumption to the answer choice:** Choice D accurately reflects this assumption.

2.  **Look for the underlying assumption that bridges the reasoning to the conclusion.**
3.  **Consider alternative assumptions and why they might be flawed.**
4.  **Choose the answer choice that best reflects the most likely assumption.**
## General Advice
*   **Focus on the general principles and assumptions underlying arguments, not just the specific examples provided.**
*   **Consider different interpretations of the argument and identify the assumptions that support each interpretation.**
*   **Think critically about the validity and implications of the assumptions.** 
*   **Practice identifying assumptions in various types of arguments.**
