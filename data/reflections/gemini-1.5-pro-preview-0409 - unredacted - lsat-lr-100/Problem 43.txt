## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the ethicist's reasoning about control over feelings but missed the key point about interpreting promises in a way that makes sense. The core assumption is about interpreting the meaning of the vow, not the nature of promises or feelings.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of argument
*   Focus on irrelevant detail 
*   Ignoring key assumption
## Solving the Problem
1.  **Analyze the Conclusion:** The ethicist concludes that "love" in marital vows should not be interpreted as referring to feelings.
2.  **Identify the Reasoning:** This conclusion is based on the premise that promises to do something uncontrollable (like controlling feelings) are nonsensical.
3.  **Find the Assumption:** The assumption must bridge the gap between the premise and conclusion. It is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify the Conclusion and Premise:** Clearly understand the main points of the argument.
2.  **Focus on the Gap:** Determine what unstated assumption connects the premise to the conclusion.
3.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** Choose the option that best represents the missing assumption needed for the argument to be valid.
4.  **Consider Alternative Interpretations:** Explore different ways the conclusion could be reached and the assumptions underlying each path.
## General Advice
