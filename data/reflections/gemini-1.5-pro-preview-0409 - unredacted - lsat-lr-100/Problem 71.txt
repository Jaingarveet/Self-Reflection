## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused too much on the exception (Hopper's Nighthawks) and its implications, overlooking the absolute statement about prints of the museum's permanent collection always being available. This led me to neglect the possibility that option C could still be true despite the exception.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Overgeneralization
*   Exception focus
*   Ignoring absolute statements 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the context:** The museum displays 20th-century works, either on loan or in its permanent collection.
2.  **Focus on the permanent collection:** Prints of ALL works in the permanent collection are available in the store.
3.  **Consider the museum store:** It also sells prints of SOME works not in the permanent collection (e.g., Nighthawks).
4.  **Evaluate options based on the above:**
    *   A and D are clearly false due to the exception (Nighthawks).
    *   B is not necessarily true as the exception could be from another century.
    *   E contradicts the fact that Nighthawks prints are sold.
    *   **C remains true** as it only refers to the permanent collection, which is guaranteed to have prints available.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Identify absolute statements:** Look for claims that apply to all members of a group without exception.
2.  **Distinguish exceptions from the rule:** Note cases that deviate from the general rule but don't invalidate it.
3.  **Focus on the scope of each statement:** Determine what group each statement applies to (e.g., all works, permanent collection, etc.).
4.  **Evaluate options based on the established facts:** Eliminate options that contradict the absolute statements or their scope.
## General Advice
*   **Read carefully and avoid assumptions:** Don't jump to conclusions based on partial information or exceptions.
*   **Pay attention to keywords:** Words like "all," "every," "some," and "only" are crucial for understanding the scope and certainty of statements.
*   **Consider multiple possibilities:** Don't get fixated on one interpretation, explore different ways the statements could be true. 
*   **Focus on what MUST be true, not what COULD be true:** Eliminate options that are not guaranteed by the given information.
