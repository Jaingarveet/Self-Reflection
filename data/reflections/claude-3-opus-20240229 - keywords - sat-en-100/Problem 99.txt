Corrected Solution:
The first paragraph is mainly focused on analyzing Chie's reaction to Akira's direct approach. It questions whether her reaction would have been more positive if Akira had followed the traditional form of using a go-between to make his proposal, instead of coming directly to her. The paragraph suggests that breaking tradition might have been the reason for Chie's negative reaction.
