Solution:
Let's use the formula: 
percent decrease = (original number - new number) / original number x 100%
We can set up the equation as follows:
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100%
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100/1
20 = (144 - x) / 1.44
20 x 1.44 = 144 - x
28.8 = 144 - x
x = 144 - 28.8
x = [REDACTED].2
Therefore, the Type [REDACTED] trees produced [REDACTED].2 pears, which is closest to [REDACTED].
