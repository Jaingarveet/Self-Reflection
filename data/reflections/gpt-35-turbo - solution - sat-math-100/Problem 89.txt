Solution:
One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
One football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
To find the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene, we need to multiply the area of one ounce by 48 and then divide by the area of one football field.
Area of one ounce of graphene = $7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{28}{3}$ acres
Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene = $\frac{28}{3} \times 48 \div 7 \approx 192$ acres
