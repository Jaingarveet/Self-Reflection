Solution:
We can use the Factor Theorem to determine which of the choices is a factor of $f(x)$.
If $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(a)=0$.
We can check which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(2)=1$, so [REDACTED] is not a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(3)$ is not given, so we cannot determine if [REDACTED] is a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(4)=0$, so [REDACTED] is a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(5)=-2$, so [REDACTED] is not a factor of $f(x)$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } x-4}$.
