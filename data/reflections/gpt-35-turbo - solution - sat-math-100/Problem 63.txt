Solution:
The initial payment is $\$ 60$.
The weekly payment is $\$ 30$.
Let $w$ be the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.
The total cost of the television is $\$ 300$.
The correct equation is $300=30w+60$ because the initial payment of $\$ 60$ must be added to the total cost of the television. 
To solve for $w$, we can start by subtracting $60$ from both sides of the equation:
\begin{align*}
300 &= 30w + 60 \\
240 &= 30w \\
8 &= w
\end{align*}
Therefore, it will take 8 weekly payments of $\$ 30$ to complete the purchase of the television.
