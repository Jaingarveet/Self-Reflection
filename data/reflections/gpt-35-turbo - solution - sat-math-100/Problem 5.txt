Solution:
Let $y$ be the number of states that joined between 1850 and 1900.
We know that $30+x=2y$ and $y=2(30-x)$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $y=60-2x$.
Equating the two expressions for $y$, we get $60-2x=30+x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=30$.
Therefore, the correct equation is $2x=60$, which simplifies to $x=30$.
