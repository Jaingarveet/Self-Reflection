Solution:
The equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
Let's check which point lies on this line by substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=0$, which is not true.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=\frac{1}{7}$, which is not true.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=1$, which is not true.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=2$, which is true.
Therefore, the point [REDACTED] lies on the line $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
