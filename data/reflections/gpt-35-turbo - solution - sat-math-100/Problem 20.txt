Solution:
To find the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations. We can use elimination or substitution to solve the system. Here, we will use elimination:
$$\begin{aligned}& 2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3 \\& 1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3\end{aligned}$$
Multiplying the second equation by $3$ and adding it to the first equation, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}2.4 x-1.5 y+4.8 x+1.5 y&=0.3-3(1.3)\\6.8 x&=-3.6\\x&=-\frac{18}{34}\\x&=-\frac{9}{17}\end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the intersection point is $-\frac{9}{17}$, which is answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ [REDACTED]}$.
