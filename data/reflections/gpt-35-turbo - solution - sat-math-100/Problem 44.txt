Solution:
The area of the entire field is $10 \text{ m} \times 10 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ m}^2$.
The area of each region is $1 \text{ m} \times 1 \text{ m} = 1 \text{ m}^2$.
There are 10 regions in total.
To approximate the number of earthworms in the entire field, we can take the average number of earthworms per region and multiply it by the total number of regions.
The total number of earthworms is approximately $\frac{107+147+146+135+149+141+150+154+176+166}{10} \cdot 100 = 14,250$.
