Solution:
Let's denote the number of left-handed female students and left-handed male students as $f$ and $m$, respectively. Then, we have:
$f + m = 18$ (total number of left-handed students)
$9m = 122 - f$ (number of right-handed male students)
$5f = 122 - 9m$ (number of right-handed female students)
Solving for $f$ and $m$, we get:
$f = \frac{610}{46}, m = \frac{170}{46}$
Now, we can find the number of right-handed female students and right-handed male students:
$5f = \frac{305}{23}$
$9m = \frac{765}{23}$
The total number of right-handed students is:
$\frac{305}{23} + \frac{765}{23} = \frac{1070}{23}$
Therefore, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is:
$\frac{\frac{305}{23}}{\frac{1070}{23}} = \frac{305}{1070} \approx 0.285$
