Solution:
Armand sent $m$ text messages each hour for 5 hours, so he sent a total of $5m$ messages.
Tyrone sent $p$ text messages each hour for 4 hours, so he sent a total of $4p$ messages.
The total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone is the sum of the messages sent by each person.
Therefore, the total number of messages sent is $5m+4p$.
