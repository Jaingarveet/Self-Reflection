Solution:
We can use elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4k x-12 y=16 \\& 4 x-5ky=7k\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
$$4x-5ky=7k-4kx+12y$$
$$4x+12y=(7k+5k)x$$
$$x=\frac{4+3k}{3k+5}$$
Substituting $x$ in the first equation, we get:
$$k\left(\frac{4+3k}{3k+5}\right)-3y=4$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$3k^2-16k+20=0$$
$$(3k-10)(k-2)=0$$
$k=\frac{10}{3}$ or $k=2$
If $k=\frac{10}{3}$, then the system of equations has a unique solution.
If $k=2$, then the system of equations has no solution.
