Solution:
The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error.
If the outlier is removed, the range will change the most because it is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.
The smallest value is 8 inches and the largest value is 16 inches.
The range is 16 - 8 = 8 inches.
If the outlier is removed, the largest value is 15 inches.
The range is 15 - 8 = 7 inches.
