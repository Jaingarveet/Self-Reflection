Solution:
The vertex form of a quadratic equation is given by $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.
We can rewrite the given equation in vertex form by completing the square.
$$y=a(x^2+2x(-2)+(-2)^2-(-2)^2-4x+8)$$
$$y=a(x-2)^2-8a$$
Thus, the vertex of the parabola is $(2,-8a)$.
To find the value of $d$, we need to substitute $2$ into the equation for $x$ and simplify.
$$y=a(2-2)(2+4)$$
$$y=0+12a$$
$$y=12a$$
Thus, $d=12a$.
