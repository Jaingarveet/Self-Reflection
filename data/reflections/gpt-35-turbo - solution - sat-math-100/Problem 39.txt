Solution:
We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
If we multiply the first equation by $2$ and add it to the second equation, we get $ax+2y=4$ and $[REDACTED]x+4y=12$.
Simplifying the second equation, we get $[REDACTED]x+2y=4$.
Comparing this equation with the first equation, we see that they are not the same.
This means that the two equations represent two different lines and have either one solution or no solution.
For the system to have no solution, the two equations must represent parallel lines.
This happens when the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional but the constant terms are not.
So, we need to find the value of $a$ such that $\frac{[REDACTED]}{a} = \frac{2}{4}$.
Simplifying, we get $[REDACTED] = a$.
