Solution:
The problem can be translated into an equation: $1[REDACTED]+4x=14+10$. 
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $1[REDACTED]+4x=[REDACTED]4$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=[REDACTED]$.
To find the value of $8x$, we substitute $x=[REDACTED]$ into $8x$.
$8x=8([REDACTED])=1[REDACTED]$.
