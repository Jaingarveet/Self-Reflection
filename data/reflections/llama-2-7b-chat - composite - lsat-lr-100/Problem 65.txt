Explanation:
The correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]

The passage provides evidence that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, which suggests that the population size of seals was relatively stable. However, the passage does not provide any information about the impact of hunting by Native peoples on the seal population. Therefore, it is possible that hunting by Native peoples did not significantly reduce the seal population over the 800-year period studied, which supports choice (E).

The other options are not supported by the passage:

* Choice (A) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the variation in seal hunting practices between different groups of Native peoples in North America.
* Choice (B) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the correlation between body size and overall health of northern fur seals.
* Choice (D) is not supported by the passage, as it does not provide any information about the effort made by Native peoples to limit their hunting of northern fur seals.

In conclusion, the passage provides evidence that the average body size of northern fur seals did not vary significantly over an 800-year period, but it does not provide any information about the impact of hunting by Native peoples on the seal population. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]
