Explanation:
The argument depends on the assumption that people cannot easily adopt strategies that involve deception unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning. This assumption is best represented by option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The argument suggests that individuals are unlikely to use exaggerated warnings from doctors to quit smoking unless they are already inclined to believe that smoking is dangerous. This implies that people are not naturally inclined to deceive themselves, and therefore would not be likely to use deception as a strategy to break their habits without external influence.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while people may tend to believe whatever doctors tell them, the argument is not based on this assumption.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while some techniques for quitting smoking may also help with other habits, the argument is not focused on this point.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while exaggerating the dangers of smoking may make it more likely for someone to quit, it is not the assumption that is being made in the argument.

Option [REDACTED] is incorrect because while a doctor may be justified in deceiving a patient in certain circumstances, this is not the assumption being made in the argument.
