Explanation:
The passage suggests that learning the lessons of history is not a straightforward task, as the situation that led to World War I is unlikely to occur again. Therefore, the lessons of history may not be directly applicable to future situations. This view is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and denying it at the same time, as one can acknowledge the importance of learning from the past while also recognizing the limitations of doing so.

The correct answer is (D) Expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.

The passage states that "it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons," which suggests that the argument is directed toward discrediting the idea that we can easily learn the lessons of history. The passage also notes that the situation that led to World War I is unlikely to occur again, which further supports the argument that the lessons of history may not be directly applicable to future situations.

Therefore, option (D) is the best answer. Options (A), (B), and (C) do not accurately describe the passage's position on learning the lessons of history. Option (E) is not relevant to the passage's argument.
