Explanation:
The argument is based on the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. Therefore, the most useful piece of information to know in order to evaluate the argument is the number of cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights.

The correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]. This information is relevant to evaluating the argument because if residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then it is more likely that the stray cocker spaniel found in the area is actually licensed and belongs to someone in Flynn Heights.

The other options are not as relevant to evaluating the argument:

(A) [REDACTED] is not directly related to the number of cocker spaniels registered in Flynn Heights.

(B) [REDACTED] is also not directly related to the number of cocker spaniels registered in Flynn Heights.

(C) [REDACTED] is relevant, but it is not the most important piece of information to know in order to evaluate the argument.

(D) [REDACTED] is not directly related to the number of cocker spaniels registered in Flynn Heights.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].
