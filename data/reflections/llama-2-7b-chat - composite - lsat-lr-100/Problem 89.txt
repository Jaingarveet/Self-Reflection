Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED] The example presented in the passage demonstrates that people are capable of inventing and interpreting dream narratives, even when no actual dream has been related. The person who left the room and returned to ask yes-or-no questions about a dream they thought they had heard constructed a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group. This is in line with the proposition that interpreting another person's dream requires understanding the dream as a coherent narrative.

The other options do not accurately describe the scenario presented:

* (A) [REDACTED] This does not explain why the person in the scenario was able to construct a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group.
* (B) [REDACTED] This does not address the ability of people to invent and interpret dream narratives.
* (C) Dreams are often just collections of iruages and ideas without coherent structures. This is a general description of dreams, but does not explain why the person in the scenario was able to construct a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group.
* (E) [REDACTED] While this is true in general, it does not explain why the person in the scenario was able to construct a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]
