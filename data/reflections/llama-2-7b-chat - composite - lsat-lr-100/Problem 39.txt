Explanation:
Rossi's argument can be most accurately described as relying on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal. This is because Rossi's argument is based on the predicted consequences of giving children the right to vote, rather than appealing to a general principle or denying the good faith of an opponent.

The other options do not accurately describe Rossi's argument:

* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi's argument makes an appeal to a general principle, but Rossi's argument does not rely on any general principle. Instead, it relies on the predicted consequences of giving children the right to vote.
* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi denies the good faith of an opponent, but Rossi's argument does not deny the good faith of any opponent.
* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy, but Rossi's argument provides a rationale for why children should not be given the right to vote based on the predicted consequences of doing so.
* Option [REDACTED]: This option suggests that Rossi employs a term on two different occasions in different senses, but there is no evidence to suggest that Rossi is using the term "consequences" in a different sense than usual.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Relying on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal.
