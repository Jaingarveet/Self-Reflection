Explanation:
Larew and Mendota are debating whether the change in economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile can be accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income. Mendota argues that while the percentage change in average income may be higher for the highest quintile, the absolute amount of the increase in average income is greater for the highest quintile.
