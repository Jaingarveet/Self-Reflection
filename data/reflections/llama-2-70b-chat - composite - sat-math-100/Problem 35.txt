Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I incorrectly solved for x = 3, when in fact, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.
I misunderstood the equation and solved for the wrong value of x.

Solution:
Let's start by squaring both sides of the equation:
$$4x = (x - 3)^2$$
Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
$$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$$
Moving all terms to the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:
$$3x = 9$$
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
$$x = 3$$
However, x = 3 does not satisfy the equation.
Let's try another approach. We can factor the left-hand side of the equation:
$$4x = \sqrt{4x}$$
We know that $\sqrt{4x} = 2x$, so we can substitute this into the equation:
$$4x = 2x$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$$2x = x$$
Subtracting x from both sides, we get:
$$x = 0$$
So, the only value of x that satisfies the given equation is x = 0.

Instructions:
1. Start by squaring both sides of the equation.
2. Expand the right-hand side of the equation.
3. Move all terms to the left-hand side and simplify.
4. Check your solution to ensure it satisfies the equation.
5. If your solution does not satisfy the equation, try another approach.
6. Factor the left-hand side of the equation.
7. Substitute the factor into the equation.
8. Solve for x.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that equations can be solved in different ways, so be open to alternative solutions.
