Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a calculation error.
I correctly identified the formula for weight, $W=mg$, but I plugged in the wrong values for the mass of the object and the acceleration due to gravity.
I used the mass of the object as 150 kg, which is the weight of the object on Earth, instead of using the correct mass of the object, which is not given in the problem.
I also used the acceleration due to gravity for [REDACTED], which is 10.7 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, instead of using the acceleration due to gravity for [REDACTED], which is 11.1 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Formula error
- Plugging in wrong values
Solution:
The correct solution is as follows:
The weight of an object on a planet can be found by using the formula $W=mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth, so we need to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.
We can do this by finding the planet with an acceleration due to gravity that would result in a weight of 170 newtons for the object.
The acceleration due to gravity on [REDACTED] is 11.1 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
Using the formula $W=mg$, we can calculate the weight of the object on [REDACTED]:
$W=m(11.1)$
$W=150(11.1)$
$W=1665$
The weight of the object on [REDACTED] is approximately 1665 newtons, which is closest to the desired weight of 170 newtons.
Therefore, the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons on [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for weight, $W=mg$.
2. Identify the given information in the problem.
3. Plug in the given values for the acceleration due to gravity and the mass of the object.
4. Calculate the weight of the object on the given planet.
5. Compare the calculated weight to the desired weight.
6. Choose the planet with the closest weight to the desired weight.
