Explanation:
Error Keywords:

* Careless mistake
* Lack of attention to detail
* Incorrect comparison

Solution:
We can start by distributing the $2x$ factor to the two terms inside the parentheses:

$2x(x^2 - 3x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2$

Now, we can compare this expression with the given choices:

[REDACTED]: $-4x^2$

This choice is not equivalent to our expression.

[REDACTED]: $3x^3 - x^2$

This choice is not equivalent to our expression.

[REDACTED]: $2x^3 - 3x$

This choice is equivalent to our expression.

[REDACTED]: $2x^3 - 6x^2$

This choice is equivalent to our expression.

Instructions:

1. Distribute the factor to the terms inside the parentheses.
2. Compare the resulting expression with the given choices.
3. Select the choice that is equivalent to the resulting expression.

Advice:

* Always carefully read and understand the question.
* Always work through the problem step-by-step, paying attention to details.
* Always compare the resulting expression with the given choices carefully.
* Never assume the answer without verifying it.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
