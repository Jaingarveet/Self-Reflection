Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation.
I misunderstood the equation and solved for $P$ as $133$, but the correct solution is $P = 120$.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Equation solving error
- Algebraic error
Solution:
We are given the supply function $S(P) = \frac{1}{2} P + 40$ and the demand function $D(P) = 220 - P$.
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we set the two functions equal to each other:
$S(P) = D(P)$
$\frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P$
$P = 120$
Instructions:
1. Set the supply function equal to the demand function.
2. Solve for $P$.
3. Check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Make sure to carry out all calculations carefully and accurately, and avoid simple algebraic errors.
