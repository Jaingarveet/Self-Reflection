Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the formula for the equation of a circle.
I thought the formula was $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, but I forgot that the radius is squared.
Error Keywords:
- Formula error
- Circle equation error
- Radius error

Solution:
The correct equation of the circle with center $(5,7)$ and radius 2 is:
$(x-5)^2 + (y-7)^2 = 4$

Instructions:
1. Identify the center of the circle.
2. Identify the radius of the circle.
3. Use the formula for the equation of a circle: $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$.
4. Plug in the values for the center and radius.
5. Simplify the equation.

Advice:
- Always review and double-check the formula before using it.
- Make sure to plug in the correct values for the variables.
- Simplify the equation to avoid confusion.
- Practice using the formula for the equation of a circle to become more comfortable with it.
