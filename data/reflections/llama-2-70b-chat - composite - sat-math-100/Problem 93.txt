Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the data in the table. I mistakenly thought that the number of male respondents enrolled in Algebra I (44) was the number of respondents enrolled in Geometry.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of data
* Careless mistake
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:
Let's examine the table again:

| | | Course | | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gender | Female | 35 | 53 | 62 |
|  | Male | 44 | 59 | 57 |
|  | Total | 79 | 112 | 119 | 310 |

We can see that the number of male respondents enrolled in Geometry is 59, not 44. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which accounts for approximately 19% of all survey respondents.

Instructions:

1. Carefully examine the data in the table.
2. Identify the correct category that accounts for approximately 19% of all survey respondents.
3. Choose the corresponding answer.

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations and data interpretation.
* Be careful when comparing values in different columns of a table.
* Take your time to avoid careless mistakes.
* Practice active reading and pay attention to details.
