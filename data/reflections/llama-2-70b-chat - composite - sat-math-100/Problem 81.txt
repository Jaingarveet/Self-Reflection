Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I used equation (2) to substitute for $ab$ in equation (1), but I forgot to distribute the $2$ to the $(a-b)$ term.
This led me to simplify incorrectly and arrive at the wrong expression.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Algebraic manipulation error
* Distributive property error

Solution:
We have $a^{2} + b^{2} = z$ and $ab = y$.
We need to find an expression equivalent to $4z + 8y$.

Let's expand the given equations:

$a^{2} + b^{2} = z$
$ab = y$

Now, we can start creating expressions using these equations:

$a^{2} + b^{2} = (a + b)^{2} - 2ab$ ....................(1)
$ab = (a + b)(a - b)$ ....................(2)

Now, substituting equation (2) into equation (1), we get:

$(a + b)^{2} - 2(a + b)(a - b) = z$

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

$(a + b)^{2} - 2ab = z$

Now, we can compare this with the given choices:

[REDACTED]: $(2a + 2b)^{2}$

We can rewrite this as:

$(2a + 2b)^{2} = (2a + b + b)^{2}$

Using the distributive property, we can expand:

$(2a + b + b)^{2} = (2a + b)^{2} + 2b(2a + b) + b^{2}$

Simplifying, we get:

$(2a + b + b)^{2} = (2a + b)^{2} + 4ab$

Which is equivalent to equation (3) we derived above.

So, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: $(2a + 2b)^{2}$.

Instructions:

1. Expand the given equations: $a^{2} + b^{2} = z$ and $ab = y$.
2. Substitute equation (2) into equation (1).
3. Simplify the expression.
4. Compare the simplified expression with the given choices.
5. Choose the correct answer.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the distributive property applies to both addition and multiplication.
