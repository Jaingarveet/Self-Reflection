Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the sign of the result when dividing both sides of the equation by 1[REDACTED]. The correct calculation is:

$$\frac{[REDACTED]}{x} = \frac{1[REDACTED]}{x+[REDACTED]0}$$

$$[REDACTED]x = 1[REDACTED](x+[REDACTED]0)$$

$$[REDACTED]x = 1[REDACTED]x + 300$$

$$x = 300$$

Therefore, the value of $\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}$ is 60.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Sign error
* Division error

Solution:

$$\frac{[REDACTED]}{x} = \frac{1[REDACTED]}{x+[REDACTED]0}$$

$$[REDACTED]x = 1[REDACTED](x+[REDACTED]0)$$

$$[REDACTED]x = 1[REDACTED]x + 300$$

$$x = 300$$

Instructions:

1. Rewrite the given equation as a equation with x on one side.
[REDACTED]. Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the fraction.
3. Expand the right-hand side.
4. Solve for x.
[REDACTED]. Check your answer to ensure it is correct.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Pay attention to signs and units in your calculations.
