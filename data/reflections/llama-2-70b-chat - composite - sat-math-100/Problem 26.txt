Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I mistakenly added the like terms incorrectly.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Like terms error
- Polynomial addition error

Solution:
First polynomial: 3x^2 - 5x + 2
Second polynomial: 5x^2 - 2x - 6

1. Add the corresponding terms:
3x^2 + 5x^2 = 8x^2
-5x + 2x = -3x
2 + (-6) = -4

2. Combine like terms:
8x^2 - 3x - 4

Instructions:
1. Identify the corresponding terms in each polynomial.
2. Add the corresponding terms.
3. Combine like terms.
4. Simplify the expression, if possible.
5. Choose the answer that matches the simplified expression.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that when adding polynomials, you must add the corresponding terms.
- Make sure to combine like terms correctly.
