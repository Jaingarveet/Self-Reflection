Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the formula for Bayes' theorem and incorrectly calculated the probability.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Probability error
- Bayes' theorem error

Solution:
The probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never," can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(Always|Not Never) = P(Not Never|Always) \* P(Always) / P(Not Never)

From the given table, P(Not Never) = 1 - [REDACTED] = [REDACTED].
P(Always) = 0.309.
P(Not Never|Always) = 1 - 0.309 = [REDACTED]1.

Now, we can calculate P(Always|Not Never):
P(Always|Not Never) = P(Not Never|Always) \* P(Always) / P(Not Never)
= [REDACTED]1 \* 0.309 / [REDACTED]
= [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for Bayes' theorem.
2. Understand the formula and its components.
3. Plug in the given values from the table.
4. Calculate the probability using the formula.
5. Compare the calculated probability to the given choices.
6. Choose the closest answer.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations.
- Make sure you understand the formula and its components before using it.
- Plug in the values carefully.
- Calculate the probability step-by-step.
- Compare the calculated probability to the given choices carefully.
- Choose the closest answer.
