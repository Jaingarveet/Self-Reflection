Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the context of the equation.
I thought the equation was describing the change in speed of sound per degree Celsius, but it's actually describing the speed of sound at a specific temperature.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the equation
- Lack of attention to units
- Failure to recognize the context of the problem

Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
The equation $S(T)=0.6T+331.4$ can be solved for $T=0$ to find the speed of sound at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which is $S(0)=331.4$ meters per second.

Instructions:
1. Read the equation carefully and pay attention to the units.
2. Understand the context of the problem and recognize that the equation is describing the speed of sound at a specific temperature.
3. Solve the equation for the temperature at which the speed of sound is given.
4. Check your answer by plugging it into the original equation.

Advice:
- Always pay attention to the units of measurement in a problem.
- Understand the context of the problem and the meaning of the variables in the equation.
- Take your time to carefully solve the equation and check your answer.
- Don't assume you know the answer without properly solving the problem.
