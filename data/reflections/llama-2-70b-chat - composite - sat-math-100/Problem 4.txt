Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I mistakenly substituted ([REDACTED], k) into the equation of the line instead of (k, [REDACTED]).
This led me to conclude that k = 32, which is incorrect.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Substitution error
- Equation error

Solution:
The line passes through the origin, so one of the points must be (k, [REDACTED]).
Substituting (k, [REDACTED]) into the equation of the line given by the two points, we get:
k = [REDACTED]

Instructions:
1. Identify the point that passes through the origin.
2. Substitute the coordinates of the point that passes through the origin into the equation of the line.
3. Solve for k.
[REDACTED]. Check your answer by plugging k into the equation of the line.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Make sure to substitute the correct coordinates into the equation of the line.
