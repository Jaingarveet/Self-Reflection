Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly cancelled out the $[REDACTED]$s in the numerator and denominator, leading me to conclude that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$. The correct solution is to recognize that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$, and therefore, $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.

Error Keywords:

* Cancellation error
* Misapplication of rules
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:

[REDACTED]. Recognize that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$.
[REDACTED]. Use this relationship to find $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Identify the given information in the problem.
[REDACTED]. Use the given information to find the value of the expression.
3. Simplify the expression, if possible.
[REDACTED]. Check your answer to ensure it is correct.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
* Use the given information to find the solution, rather than relying on general rules or formulas.
* Simplify your answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct.
* Double-check your answer to ensure it is correct.

Reflection:
I will be more careful in my reasoning and pay closer attention to the given information in the problem. I will also make sure to simplify my answer, if possible, to ensure it is correct. In the future, I will double-check my answer to prevent similar errors.
