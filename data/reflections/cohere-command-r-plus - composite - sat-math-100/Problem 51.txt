Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Subtraction error

Solution: Solving the system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 2 x-3 y=-14 \quad \cdot 3 \\
& 3 x-2 y=-6 \quad \cdot 2 \\
\end{aligned}$$

We get:

$$\begin{aligned}
& 6 x-9 y=[REDACTED]2 \\
& 6 x[REDACTED] y=-12
\end{aligned}$$

Subtracting the equations eliminates the $x$ variable:

$$\begin{aligned}
9 y - 4 y &= [REDACTED]2 - (-12) \\
5 y &= -30 \\
y &= -6
\end{aligned}$$

Plugging $y = -6$ into either original equation to solve for $x$:

$$\begin{aligned}
2x - 3(-6) &= -14 \\
2x + 1[REDACTED] &= -14 \\
2x &= -32 \\
x &= -16
\end{aligned}$$

Now, we can find the value of $x - y$:

$$x - y = -16 - (-6) = -10 + 6 = [REDACTED]$$

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Solve the system of equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$.
2. Double-check your calculations for $x$ and $y$.
3. Calculate the value of $x - y$ using the found values of $x$ and $y$.
4. Simplify the expression $x - y$ to find the final answer.
5. Choose the answer choice that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Pay close attention to the specifics of the question. In this case, we are asked to find the value of $x - y$, not just $x$ or $y$ individually.
- Take your time and avoid rushing through the problem, especially when performing calculations.
