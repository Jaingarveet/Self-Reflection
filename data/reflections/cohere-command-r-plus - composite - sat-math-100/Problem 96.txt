Explanation:
I incorrectly set up the equation to solve for the percentage change in the width. 
I should have compared the areas of the original and altered rectangles to account for the [REDACTED]% decrease in area. 
Instead, I incorrectly equated the altered area to 88% of the original area, leading to an incorrect value for $p$.

Solution:
Let $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the rectangle.
The original area of the rectangle is $LW$.
After altering the rectangle, the new length is $1.1L$, and the new width is $(1-p/100)W$.
The new area of the rectangle is $A' = (1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.
We are given that this alteration results in a [REDACTED]% decrease in the area, so $A' = 0.88 \times LW$.

Now, we set up the equation:
$$0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$0.88 = 1.1(1-p/100)$$

Multiplying both sides by 100:
$$88 = 110 - 110p/100$$

Isolating $p$:
$$-110p/100 = -[REDACTED]$$
$$p = [REDACTED]$$

Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: Identify the given information and the variable to be determined ($p$).
2. Define variables: Let $L$ be the length, $W$ be the width, and $A$ be the area of the rectangle.
3. Calculate the original area: The area of the rectangle is $LW$.
4. Calculate the altered area: After changing the length and width, the new area is $(1.1L)(1-p/100)W$.
5. Set up the equation: The altered area is [REDACTED]% less than the original area, so set up the equation $0.88LW = (1.1)(1-p/100)LW$.
6. Simplify the equation: Simplify the equation to isolate $p$.
7. Solve for $p$: Calculate the value of $p$ by isolating it in the equation.
8. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that matches the calculated value of $p$.

Advice:
- Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the variable to be solved.
- Define clear variables to represent the unknown values.
- Use algebraic equations to represent the relationships between the variables.
- Simplify equations step-by-step to avoid errors.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the problem's context.
- Be cautious when dealing with percentages, and ensure you apply them correctly.
