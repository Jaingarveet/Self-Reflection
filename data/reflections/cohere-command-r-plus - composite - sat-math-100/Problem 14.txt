Solution:

The table shows that as x increases by 3a, y decreases by a. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of -1/3. The y-intercept is at (0,0), as when x=a, y=0. 

The equation for this line is y = (-1/3)x, or, rearranging to make 'x' the subject: 

$2x - 3y = 0 \times 5a$. 

Multiplying by 5a gives: 

$2x - 3y = 0$, or $2x - 3y = a \times 0$, which simplifies to $x + 2y = 0 \times a$, or $x + 2y = a$. 

Instructions:

1. Examine the table and identify the pattern: as x increases by 3a, y decreases by 1a. 
2. Recognize this as a linear relationship with a negative slope. 
3. Find the y-intercept by identifying the value of y when x=a. 
4. Express the relationship as an equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
5. Rearrange the equation to make x the subject, and then multiply by the appropriate value of a to match the options. 

Advice:

- Always examine the data carefully and identify patterns or relationships. 
- Avoid making assumptions; work with the data as it is presented. 
- When dealing with linear relationships, focus on the slope and y-intercept. 
- Practice rearranging equations and identifying equivalent expressions. 
- Double-check your work by substituting values from the table into your equation.
