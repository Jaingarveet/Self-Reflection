Solution:

$$\frac{3}{5} w = \frac{4}{3}$$

To solve for $w$, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\frac{5}{3}$:

$$w = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{9}.$$

Therefore, the correct answer is $w = \frac{20}{9}$, which is choice [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given equation.
2. Recognize that you need to isolate $w$.
3. Multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of the coefficient of $w$.
4. Simplify the resulting expression step-by-step.
5. Choose the answer that matches your simplified result. 

Advice:
 - Always read and understand the given equation. 
 - Clearly identify the variable you need to solve for. 
 - Know the properties of fractions, including reciprocals and multiplication. 
 - Simplify expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy. 
 - Double-check your final answer and ensure it satisfies the original equation.
