Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that $[REDACTED]b$ in the numerator would cancel out with $a$ in the denominator, resulting in a final value of $\frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}$. However, my mistake was in not recognizing that $[REDACTED]b$ should be simplified to $[REDACTED]a$ before proceeding with the calculation. This incorrect assumption led me to choose answer option [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic simplification error
- Cancellation error
- Assumption error

Solution:
Given $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$, we can rewrite this as $a = [REDACTED]b$. Now, we substitute this expression into the fraction:
$\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \frac{[REDACTED]a}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED] \cdot [REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]} = C$

Instructions:
[REDACTED]. Identify the given information: $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Rewrite $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = [REDACTED]b$.
3. Substitute this expression into the fraction: $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b}$.
[REDACTED]. Simplify the fraction: $\frac{[REDACTED]a}{a}$.
5. Further simplify by substituting $a = [REDACTED]b$: $\frac{[REDACTED] \cdot [REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b}$.
6. Calculate the value: $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = \frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}$, which matches choice [REDACTED].

Advice:
- Always simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.
- Be cautious when canceling out factors; ensure you're not eliminating information that should be used in subsequent steps.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that fractions can be simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.
