Solution:
Starting with the equation:
$$\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) - [REDACTED] = 9x - 6$$

First, add $[REDACTED]$ and $6$ to both sides to isolate the terms with the variable:
$$\frac{2}{3}(9x - 6) = 9x + 2$$

Now, multiply both sides by $\frac{3}{2}$ to eliminate the fraction:
$$3(9x - 6) = 9x + 2 \cdot \frac{3}{2}$$
$$3(9x - 6) = 9x + 3$$

Simplify and distribute the $3$:
$$27x - 18 = 9x + 3$$

Isolate $9x$ by subtracting it from both sides:
$$18x - 18 = 3$$

Divide both sides by $18$ to solve for $x$:
$$x = \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6}$$

Now that we have the value of $x$, we can plug it into the expression $3x - 2$:
$$3 \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) - 2$$

Simplifying this expression:
$$\frac{1}{2} - 2 = [REDACTED]$$

So, the value of $3x - 2$ is $[REDACTED]$.

Instructions:
1. Ensure the equation is balanced and all terms are correctly isolated.
2. Carefully perform each operation, step-by-step, simplifying as you go.
3. Double-check your work after each step, especially when isolating variables.
[REDACTED]. Pay attention to signs and be mindful of the difference between addition and subtraction.
5. Solve for $x$ accurately before plugging it into the expression.
6. Simplify the final expression to match the format of the answer choices.

Advice:
- Always double-check your work, especially when manipulating equations.
- Take your time and be meticulous with each step.
- Ensure you understand the fundamentals of algebraic manipulation.
- Practice similar problems to improve your fluency and accuracy.
- Be cautious when dealing with fractions and mixed numbers.
