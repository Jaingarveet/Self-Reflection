Solution:

The equation $h=-4.9t^2 + 25t$ describes the height of the ball over time. We want to find when the ball hits the ground, i.e., when $h=0$. 

Setting $h=0$, we get:
$0=-4.9t^2 + 25t$

Using the quadratic formula:
$t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

Plugging in the values:
$t = \frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{25^2 - 4 \cdot -4.9 \cdot 0}}{2 \cdot -4.9} = \frac{-25 \pm 25}{2 \cdot -4.9} = -50/(-9.8) \approx 5.10$ seconds

Now, we consider the context: the ball is launched upward, so the relevant solution is the positive one, approximately $5.10$ seconds. This is closer to $[REDACTED]$ seconds, so the correct answer is **D**.

Instructions:
1. Understand the context: a ball is launched vertically upward with an initial velocity, and we want to find when it hits the ground. 
2. Set $h=0$ to find when the height is zero (ground level). 
3. Use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$, being careful with the signs and square root calculations. 
4. Interpret the solutions: the positive value represents the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground. 
5. Compare the approximate value to the given answer choices and select the best match. 

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the context. 
 - Pay attention to the signs and square root calculations when using the quadratic formula. 
 - Consider the physical meaning of the solutions and choose the one that makes sense in the given context. 
 - Double-check your calculations and the interpretation of the results. 
 - Approximate carefully and only when necessary, keeping in mind the level of precision required.
