Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Incorrect application of a formula

Solution:

The line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, and the slope is given as $\frac{1}{7}$. We can use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: 
$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

Plugging in $m = \frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$, we get:
$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now, we can test each choice by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation:
- [REDACTED]: $(0, 7)$: $7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0$
- [REDACTED]: $(1, 7)$: $7 \neq \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1$
- [REDACTED]: $(7, 7)$: $7 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7$, which is true, but this does not mean that $(7, 7)$ lies on the line. We cannot choose an answer based on a single point satisfying the equation. We need to test the equation with the coordinates provided in the choices.
- [REDACTED]: $(14, 2)$: $2 = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14$, which is true. This means that the point $(14, 2)$ satisfies the equation of the line and lies on the line.

Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the concept of slope and the point-slope formula.
2. Identify the given information: the point $(0, 0)$ and the slope $m = \frac{1}{7}$.
3. Use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.
4. Plug in the values of $m$, $x_1$, and $y_1$ into the formula to get $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
5. Test each choice by plugging the values of $x$ and $y$ from the choices into the equation $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
6. Choose the answer where the equation holds true. 
7. Remember that a line in the plane is defined by its equation, not by a single point.

Advice:
- Understand the basic concepts of slope and the point-slope formula.
- Be careful when plugging values into formulas and performing calculations.
- Always test each choice provided in the multiple-choice question.
- Remember that a line in the plane is defined by its equation, not by a single point. Avoid making conclusions based on a single point satisfying the equation.
