Solution: We are looking for the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to $1,000$. Let's plug in the given values and solve:

$$1,000=1,052+1.08 t$$

Subtract $1,052$ from both sides:

$$-52=1.08 t$$

Divide both sides by $1.08$ to solve for $t$:

$$t \approx -48.15$$

Given the choices, [REDACTED] is the closest value to $-48.15^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the relationship between the speed of sound and air temperature.
2. Recognize that we are looking for an approximate value, not an exact match.
3. Plug in the given values and solve for $t$.
4. Compare each answer choice to the calculated value of $t$ and choose the closest match.

Advice:
- Pay close attention to the specific values and units provided in the question.
- Understand the difference between finding an exact match and finding the closest value.
- Practice solving equations and approximating values.
- Always double-check your calculations and interpretations.
