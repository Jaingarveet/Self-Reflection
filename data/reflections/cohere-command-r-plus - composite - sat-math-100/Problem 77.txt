Solution:
To find the mean of List [REDACTED], sum up all the values and divide by the number of values: $(1+2+3+4+5+6) / 6 = 21 / 6 = 3.5$. 

For the standard deviation of List [REDACTED], use the formula: 
$\sigma_[REDACTED] = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{6} (x_i - \mu)^2}{6}}$, where $\mu$ is the mean. 

Plugging in the values: 
$\sigma_[REDACTED] = \sqrt{\frac{(1-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + (3-3.5)^2 + (4-3.5)^2 + (5-3.5)^varint + (6-3.5)^2}{6}} \approx 1.58$. 

Now we can see that the mean of List [REDACTED] is 3.5, which is the same as the mean of List [REDACTED]. The standard deviation of List [REDACTED] is different from that of List [REDACTED], so the correct answer is indeed "[REDACTED]."

Instructions:
1. Calculate the mean of List [REDACTED] by summing the values and dividing by the count.
2. Calculate the mean of List [REDACTED] using the same method.
3. Compare the means to determine if they are equal.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of List [REDACTED] using the formula and the mean from step 1.
5. Calculate the standard deviation of List [REDACTED].
6. Compare the standard deviations to check for equality.
7. Choose the answer option that matches your findings.

Advice:
- Double-check your calculations for means and standard deviations. 
- Ensure you understand the formulas and apply them correctly. 
- Take your time and avoid rushing through calculations to prevent errors. 
- Always check your work, especially when dealing with statistical concepts.
