- Simplification error
- Fraction arithmetic error

Solution: Solving the system of equations step by step: 

$\begin{array}{r}
3x + 4y = -23 \quad \cdot2 \\
6x + 8y = -46 \\
\end{array}$

$\begin{array}{r}
2y - x = -19 \quad \cdot4 \\
8y - 4x = -76 \\
\end{array}$

Adding the two equations eliminates $y$:
$6x + 8y + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$
$14y = -122$
$y = -\frac{122}{14} = -8.71$ (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, plug $y$ into one of the original equations to find $x$:
$3x + 4y = -23$
$3x + 4(-8.71) = -23$
$3x - 34.84 = -23$
$3x = 11.84$
$x = \frac{11.84}{3} \approx 3.95$ (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the solution is $(x, y) \approx (3.95, -8.71)$, which is closest to choice **B**. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4 to clear the fractions.
2. Add the two equations to eliminate $y$.
3. Solve for $y$ in the resulting equation.
4. Plug the value of $y$ into one of the original equations.
5. Solve for $x$.
6. Check your calculations and the final answer. 

Advice:
- Always distribute multiplication over addition/subtraction when simplifying equations. 
- Be careful with fractions and perform calculations accurately. 
- Double-check your arithmetic and calculations at each step. 
- When approximating decimal values, round consistently to a set number of decimal places. 
- Always check your final answer choices for the best match.
