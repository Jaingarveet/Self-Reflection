Explanation:
I misinterpreted the relationship between the number of gallons, the number of miles, and the cost. 
I incorrectly assumed that the number of gallons reduced was directly related to the cost savings, without considering the impact on the total number of miles driven.

 - Misinterpretation
 - Algebraic error
 - Unit conversion error
Solution:
 - Alan currently drives $100$ miles per week and wants to save $\$5$ on gasoline. 
 - Gasoline costs $\$4$ per gallon, and his car's mileage is $25$ miles per gallon. 
 - To determine how many fewer miles he should drive, we need to find the number of miles represented by $\$5$ worth of gasoline at the given rate. 
 - $\$5$ worth of gasoline at $\$4$ per gallon is $5/4 = 1.25$ gallons. 
 - This amount of gasoline, at a rate of $25$ miles per gallon, will allow him to drive $1.25 * 25 = 31.25$ miles. 
 - So, the equation representing this relationship is $\frac{25}{4}m = 31.25$, where $m$ is the number of fewer miles driven. 
 - Simplifying the equation, we get $\frac{25}{4}m = \frac{5}{4} * 12.5 = 5$, which is choice $D$.
Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: Alan's average weekly mileage, car's mileage, desired savings, and gasoline cost.
2. Identify the relationships: Number of gallons to the number of miles and cost to the number of gallons.
3. Calculate the number of gallons represented by the desired savings: $\$5$ savings at $\$4$ per gallon.
4. Determine the number of miles represented by the calculated gallons: Use the car's mileage rate.
5. Set up the equation: Express the relationship between the number of fewer miles ($m$) and the desired savings.
6. Simplify the equation: Ensure it matches the format of the choices and your calculations.
7. Choose the correct answer: Select the choice that aligns with your simplified equation.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the units and their conversions. 
 - Clearly define the relationships between the variables and their units. 
 - Double-check your calculations and unit conversions. 
 - Ensure you understand the underlying relationships before forming equations. 
 - Simplify equations step-by-step to avoid errors.
