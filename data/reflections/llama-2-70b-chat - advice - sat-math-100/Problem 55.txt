Advice:
 - Always graph the parabola to visualize its nature and identify its minimum or maximum.
 - Always double-check your answer by plugging in the $x$-coordinate into the equation.
 - Remember that the minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which can be found by setting the first derivative equal to zero and solving for $x$.
