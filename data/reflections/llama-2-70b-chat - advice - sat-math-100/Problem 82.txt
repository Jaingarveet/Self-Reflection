* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the vertex of a parabola can be found using the formula $(c, d) = \left(\frac{-b}{2a}, \frac{-b^2}{4a}\right)$.
