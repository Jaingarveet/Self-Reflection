Advice:

* Always pay attention to units when calculating and interpreting slopes.
* Make sure to choose appropriate values for the variables when finding the slope.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Use the equation to find the estimated increase in height for a specific age, rather than relying on the slope alone.
