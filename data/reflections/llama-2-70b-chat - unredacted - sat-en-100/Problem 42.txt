  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
Passage 1 discusses the potential for mining beyond Earth and the efforts of various companies and organizations to make it a reality. Passage 2, on the other hand, raises concerns about the environmental and ethical implications of space mining and argues that a broad agreement on the for-profit exploitation of space is necessary to avoid disputes and ensure secure investments.

Therefore, option D best describes the relationship between the passages, as Passage 2 expresses reservations about the developments discussed in Passage 1.
