  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
The 1993 experiment conducted by Olausson and his colleagues showed that gentle pressure on the arm prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay in the signal identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers. This means that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers, which supports conclusion C.

The other choices are not supported by the findings of the experiment:

A: The experiment did not test the speed of sensation at bodily extremities versus stimulation closer to the brain.

B: The presence of hairs in human skin did not affect the speed of nerve conduction.

D: The experiment did not test the relationship between the strength of pressure applied to the nerve and the speed at which the nerve fires.

Therefore, the best conclusion supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is conclusion C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.
