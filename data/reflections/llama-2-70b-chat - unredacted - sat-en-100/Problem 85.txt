  Action: Answer("C")

Explanation:
Maguire's findings regarding taxi drivers are significant because they call into question an earlier consensus that the adult brain is incapable of spawning new neurons. The study found that the right posterior hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in spatial navigation, was 7% larger in taxi drivers than in normal individuals, suggesting that the brain is capable of reorganizing itself and adapting to new sensory input. This challenges the previous belief that the brain's basic anatomical structure is static, and provides evidence for the concept of neuroplasticity. Therefore, option C is the best answer.
