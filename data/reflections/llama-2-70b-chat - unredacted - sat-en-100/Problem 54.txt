  The correct answer is indeed A: The narrator emphasizes Silas's former obsession with wealth by depicting his gold as requiring certain behaviors on his part.

The narrator uses the technique of personification to describe the gold as having a will of its own and demanding certain behaviors from Silas, such as sitting weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web. This portrays Silas as being under the spell of his gold, obsessed with it, and unable to break free from its grasp. It also highlights the contrast between Silas's former obsession with wealth and his later love and devotion to Eppie, who brings him joy and reawakens his senses.

The other options do not accurately describe the technique the narrator uses to represent Silas's character before he adopted Eppie. Option B, for example, is not supported by the text, as the narrator does not describe the gold as seeming to reproduce on its own. Option C is also not accurate, as the narrator does not explicitly contrast Silas's present behavior toward his neighbors with his past behavior toward them. Option D is not supported by the text either, as the narrator does not imply that Silas is unable to recall life before Eppie.
