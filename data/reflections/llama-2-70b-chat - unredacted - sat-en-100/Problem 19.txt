  Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is D: An unexpected finding arises during the early phase of a study; the study is modified in response to this finding, and the results are interpreted and evaluated.

The passage describes how Ken Dial observed a pattern in how young ground birds ran along behind their parents and decided to conduct a study to investigate the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate. He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species and designed a project to measure the birds' first hops and flights. However, the local rancher advised him to give the birds something to climb on, as they preferred to rest on ledges or low branches rather than the ground. Ken brought in hay bales for the Chukars to perch on, and his son Terry fed and collected data on the birds.

Terry observed the baby Chukars using their legs to run up the side of the hay bales, flapping their wings all the while. Ken realized that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively and came up with a series of experiments to study this phenomenon. They found that the birds were using a technique called WAIR (wing-assisted incline running), which allowed them to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, as the study was modified in response to an unexpected finding, and the results were interpreted and evaluated.
