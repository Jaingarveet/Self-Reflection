  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The passage states that Sempere is a bookseller who allows the protagonist to read books in his shop and sometimes gives him books for free. It also mentions that Sempere knows some authors who frequent his establishment, and that he handles an old volume of "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens with care. However, there is no indication that Sempere models his own writing after Dickens's style (choice A), feels a personal connection to details of Dickens's biography (choice C), or considers himself to be Dickens's most appreciative reader (choice D). Therefore, the best characterization of the relationship between Sempere and Charles Dickens is that Sempere is an avid admirer of Dickens's work (choice B).
