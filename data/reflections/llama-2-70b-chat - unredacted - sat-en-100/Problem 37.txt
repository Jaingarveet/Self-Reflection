  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The passage discusses how democracy can affect the inequality between men and women. The author believes that social changes that bring people closer to the same level will make women more equal to men. The author also mentions that the Americans understand that democratic equality between the sexes means giving each gender distinct employment based on their faculties. The author suggests that society has grown out of the state of inequality being its basis, and now tends to substitute a just equality as the general principle of human relations. Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles they describe are part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.
