  Action: Answer("C")

The main purpose of the passage is to explain research conducted to study why some birds fly in a V formation. The passage describes a study that used data loggers to track the flight patterns of northern bald ibises and found that the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. The study suggests that birds fly in a V formation to save energy during flight, and the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because while the passage mentions that squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a V formation, this is not the main purpose of the passage.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage discusses the effects of downdrafts on birds and airplanes, this is not the main focus of the passage.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage includes the quotation "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," the passage does not focus on how birds sense air currents through their feathers.
