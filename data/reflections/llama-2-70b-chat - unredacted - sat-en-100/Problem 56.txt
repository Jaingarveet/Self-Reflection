  Action: Answer("D")

The passage states that the narrator pays Sempere much less for the books than they are worth. The bookseller hardly ever allows the narrator to pay for the books he gives him, and when the narrator tries to leave the coins he has collected on the counter, Sempere doesn't take them. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
