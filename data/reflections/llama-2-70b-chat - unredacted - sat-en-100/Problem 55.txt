  Action: Answer("A")

The narrator notes that the glass cases in the ink shop are very shiny, and not one pane is broken. Within those glass cases are our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village. This suggests that the ink shop displays the family's ink more impressively than the ink-making studio. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
