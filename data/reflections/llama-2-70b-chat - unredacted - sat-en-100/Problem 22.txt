  Action: Answer("A")

Explanation:
The question is asking for evidence to support the idea that the base pairing in DNA is complementary, specifically that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.

The table shows the percentage of each base in various organisms' DNA, including sea urchin DNA.

To find evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, we need to look for a pair of bases that have a high percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DNA.

The highest percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DNA is between adenine and thymine, with 17.3% and 17.7% respectively. This suggests that adenine and thymine are paired together in sea urchin DNA, which supports the idea of complementary base pairing.

Therefore, the answer is A: $17.3 \%$ and $17.7 \%$.

You did not provide your answer in the correct format.
Your answer must be stated as 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")';
where [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice.

In this case, the correct answer choice is A, so the correct format for your answer would be:
