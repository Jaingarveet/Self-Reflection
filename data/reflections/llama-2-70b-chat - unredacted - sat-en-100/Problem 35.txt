  Action: Answer("A")

The passage suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization. The fMRIs showed that regions of the brain that were less active in control subjects were working in overdrive for the mental athletes. Surprisingly, when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding. This suggests that the mental athletes were using different parts of their brains to memorize information, which is not a common way of memorization. Therefore, option A is the best answer.
