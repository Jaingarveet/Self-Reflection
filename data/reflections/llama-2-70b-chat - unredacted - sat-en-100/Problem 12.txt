  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The passage states that fast fibers were believed to be responsible for transmitting information about location and pressure, and that blocking fast fibers would eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether. However, it does not suggest that blocking fast fibers would result in the body compensating by using slow fibers to sense pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is D, "The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired."

Error Keywords:
- Blocking fast fibers
- Slow fibers
- Pressure
- Vibrations

Solution:
1. Read the passage carefully and understand the relationship between fast fibers, slow fibers, pressure, and vibrations.
2. Identify the incorrect assumptions in the question stem.
3. Choose the answer that best aligns with the information in the passage.
