## Explanation:
I misinterpreted the formula and the meaning of the slope in the context of the problem. I correctly identified the formula as being in slope-intercept form but incorrectly assumed that the slope represented the change in height for a one-inch change in femur length. However, the formula actually represents the change in femur length for a one-inch change in height.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of slope
* Incorrect application of slope-intercept form
* Confusion between dependent and independent variables
## Solution:
1. Identify the variables:
    * **H**: Dependent variable (height)
    * **L**: Independent variable (femur length)
2. Recognize the formula as slope-intercept form:
    * **H = 1.88L + 32.01**
    * **Slope (m) = 1.88**
    * **Y-intercept (b) = 32.01**
3. Interpret the slope:
    * The slope represents the change in the dependent variable (H) for a one-unit change in the independent variable (L).
    * In this case, the slope of 1.88 means that for every one-inch increase in a man's height, his femur length increases by approximately 1.88 inches.
4. Choose the answer that reflects the correct interpretation of the slope:
    * **D: The approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length**
## Instructions:
1. Identify the variables and their roles (dependent vs. independent).
2. Recognize the formula as slope-intercept form.
3. Calculate the slope and interpret its meaning in the context of the problem.
4. Choose the answer that reflects the correct interpretation of the slope.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to the context of the problem and the units of measurement for each variable.
* Remember that the slope in slope-intercept form represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable.
* Be mindful of the direction of the change (increase or decrease) when interpreting the slope.
* Double-check your calculations and interpretations before selecting an answer.
