## Explanation:
My initial thought process was correct in terms of distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. However, I made a mistake while combining the $x^2y$ terms. I incorrectly added them instead of subtracting them, leading to an inaccurate final answer.
## Error Keywords:
* Sign error
* Combining like terms error
* Addition/subtraction error
## Solution:
1. Distribute the negative sign:
$$(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}) - (-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}) =$$
$$x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2} + x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$
2. Combine like terms:
* Combine $x^2y$ terms: $x^2 y + x^2 y = 2x^2 y$
* Combine $xy^2$ terms: $5xy^2 - 3xy^2 = 2xy^2$
* Combine $y^2$ terms: $-3y^2 + 3y^2 = 0$
3. Final expression:
$$2x^2 y + 2xy^2$$
## Instructions:
1. Carefully distribute any negative signs.
2. Identify like terms (terms with the same variables and exponents).
3. Combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients, depending on their signs.
4. Double-check your calculations and ensure all like terms are combined.
5. Write the final simplified expression.
## General Advice:
* Pay close attention to signs when distributing or combining terms.
* Double-check your calculations to avoid arithmetic errors.
* Organize your work to keep track of like terms and their coefficients.
* If unsure, break down the problem into smaller steps and tackle them one at a time.
* Practice similar problems to solidify your understanding and avoid repeating mistakes.
