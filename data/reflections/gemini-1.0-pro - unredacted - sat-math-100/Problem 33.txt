## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly identified the standard equation of a circle. While I correctly plugged in the given center and radius, I used the wrong signs for the differences in the equation. This led me to choose answer choice C instead of the correct answer, A.
**Error Keywords:**
* Sign error
* Equation manipulation error
* Standard equation of a circle error
**Solution:**
1. Recall the standard equation of a circle: $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
2. Identify the given center $(5, 7)$ and radius $2$.
3. Substitute these values into the standard equation: $(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 2^2$.
4. Simplify the equation: $(x - 5)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 4$.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Memorize the standard equation of a circle.
2. Carefully identify the center and radius from the given information.
3. Substitute the values into the standard equation without making sign errors.
4. Simplify the equation and compare it to the answer choices.
**General Advice:**
* Double-check calculations and ensure correct signs are used.
* Visualize the problem and the geometric interpretation of the equation.
* Practice solving similar problems to solidify understanding.
* Be mindful of common errors and learn from mistakes.
