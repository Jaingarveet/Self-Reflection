## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach to solving the equation was incorrect. I attempted to isolate the square root term by squaring both sides of the equation. However, this introduced extraneous solutions and led me to the wrong answer.
**Error Keywords:**
* Extraneous solutions
* Squaring both sides of an equation
* Incorrect algebraic manipulation
**Solution:**
1. **Rewrite the equation:** To avoid introducing extraneous solutions, we can square both sides only after isolating the square root term. 
2. **Isolate the square root term:** Add 3 to both sides of the equation: $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$ becomes $\sqrt{4x} + 3 = x$.
3. **Square both sides:** $(\sqrt{4x} + 3)^2 = x^2$.
4. **Simplify and solve for x:** Expanding the left side and simplifying, we get $4x + 9 = x^2$. Rearranging and factoring, we get $x^2 - 4x - 9 = (x - 9)(x + 1) = 0$. Therefore, the possible solutions are $x = 9$ and $x = -1$.
5. **Check for extraneous solutions:** We need to check if either solution satisfies the original equation. Only $x = 9$ satisfies $\sqrt{4x} = x - 3$.
**Instructions:**
1. Isolate the square root term on one side of the equation.
2. Square both sides of the equation.
3. Simplify the resulting equation and solve for the variable.
4. Check each potential solution in the original equation to eliminate extraneous solutions.
**General Advice:**
* Be cautious when manipulating equations with square roots. Squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions.
* Consider alternative approaches to solving equations, such as isolating the variable before applying other operations.
* Always check potential solutions in the original equation to ensure they are valid.
* Practice solving various types of equations to develop a strong understanding of algebraic techniques.
