Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the planet with the acceleration due to gravity that would result in the desired weight. 
My error was in misinterpreting the formula and failing to account for the mass of the object.
Error Keywords:
 - Formula misinterpretation
 - Mass omission
 - Gravity acceleration confusion
Solution:
The weight of an object on Earth is 150 newtons.
The weight of an object on another planet is 170 newtons.
The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The acceleration due to gravity on the other planet is unknown.
The formula for weight is $W=m g$.
We can use the formula to find the acceleration due to gravity on the other planet.
$W=m g$
$170=m \times 9.8$
$m=\frac{170}{9.8}$
We can use the chart to find the planet with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The planet with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$ is Saturn.
Instructions:
1. Identify the weight of the object on Earth.
2. Identify the desired weight of the object on another planet.
3. Identify the acceleration due to gravity on Earth.
4. Use the formula $W=mg$ to find the mass of the object.
5. Use the chart to find the planet with the acceleration due to gravity that would result in the desired weight for the given mass.
6. Be mindful of the units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.
7. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the known and unknown variables.
 - Always use the appropriate formula to solve the problem.
 - Always be mindful of the units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the weight of an object is directly proportional to its mass and the acceleration due to gravity.
