## Explanation:
My initial approach was correct in isolating $v$ on one side of the equation. However, I made a sign error when factoring out $v$. I should have factored out a negative $v$ from both terms on the right side of the equation, resulting in a positive $16t$ term instead of a negative one.
## Error Keywords:
* Sign error
* Factoring error
* Algebra error
## Solution:
1. Move the constant term to the left side:
$$h+k=-16 t^{2}+v t$$
2. Factor out $v$:
$$h+k=v(t -16 t)$$
3. Isolate $v$:
$$v=\frac{h+k}{t}-16 t$$
## Instructions:
1. Identify the term containing $v$.
2. Isolate the term containing $v$ on one side of the equation.
3. Factor out $v$ from the remaining terms.
4. Be mindful of signs when factoring.
5. Simplify the expression for $v$.
## General Advice:
* Double-check all calculations and signs to avoid careless errors.
* Break down complex equations into smaller, more manageable steps.
* Practice factoring and manipulating algebraic expressions.
* Review the order of operations (PEMDAS) to ensure correct calculations.
* When unsure, double-check your work or consult additional resources.
