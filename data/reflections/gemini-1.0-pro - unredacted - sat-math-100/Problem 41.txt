Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the function $f(x)$ was defined by a polynomial. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in the concept of factors but in the understanding of the problem statement. 
I did not recognize that the function $f(x)$ could be any function, not necessarily a polynomial.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the problem statement
 - Incorrect assumption about the function type
 - Ignoring the possibility of non-polynomial functions
Solution:
The function $f(x)$ is defined by a polynomial.
The table shows that $f(4)=0$.
Therefore, $x-4$ must be a factor of $f(x)$.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem statement carefully and understand the context.
2. Identify the type of function $f(x)$ is defined as.
3. Analyze the given information about the function $f(x)$.
4. Look for patterns or relationships in the given information.
5. Use the given information to identify potential factors of $f(x)$.
6. Verify that the identified factors are indeed factors of $f(x)$.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem statement carefully and understand the context.
 - Do not make assumptions about the problem or the information provided.
 - Consider all possibilities and explore different approaches.
 - Be open to different types of functions and mathematical concepts.
 - Double-check your understanding and reasoning before reaching a conclusion.
