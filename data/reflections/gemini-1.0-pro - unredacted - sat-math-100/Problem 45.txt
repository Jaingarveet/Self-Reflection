## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial analysis correctly identified the slope and y-intercept of the linear relationship. However, I made a crucial error in interpreting the context of the problem. I focused solely on the change in shipping charge per 5-pound increase, neglecting the initial charge of $16.94 for 0 pounds of merchandise. This led me to overlook the constant term in the linear equation.
**Error Keywords:**
* Contextual misinterpretation
* Incomplete analysis
* Ignoring initial value
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the slope:** The shipping charge increases by $4.95 for every 5-pound increase, resulting in a slope of $4.95/5 = 0.99$.
2. **Consider the initial value:** When the merchandise weight is 0 pounds, the shipping charge is $16.94. This represents the y-intercept of the linear relationship.
3. **Formulate the equation:** Using the slope and y-intercept, the linear equation representing the total shipping charge $f(x)$ for a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is:
$$f(x) = 0.99x + 16.94$$
