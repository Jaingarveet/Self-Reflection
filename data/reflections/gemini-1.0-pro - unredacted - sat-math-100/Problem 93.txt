## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I incorrectly identified the category that represented approximately 19% of the respondents. My initial analysis focused on the female students, leading me to choose option A (Females taking Geometry). However, I overlooked the male students and failed to consider their contribution to the overall percentage.
**Error Keywords:**
* **Categorization error:** I focused on a specific category (females) without considering the complete picture.
* **Percentage miscalculation:** I misinterpreted the percentage and its corresponding category.
* **Data oversight:** I overlooked a significant portion of the data (male students).
**Solution:**
1. **Calculate the total number of respondents:** 310
2. **Calculate the target percentage:** 19%
3. **Calculate the number of respondents representing 19%:** 310 x 0.19 â‰ˆ 59
4. **Analyze each category:**
    * Females taking Geometry: 53
    * Females taking Algebra II: 62
    * Males taking Geometry: **59** 
    * Males taking Algebra I: 44
5. **Identify the category closest to 59:** Males taking Geometry
**Instructions:**
1. Calculate the total number of respondents.
2. Calculate the target percentage.
3. Calculate the number of respondents representing the target percentage.
4. Analyze each category and compare its count to the calculated number.
5. Choose the category closest to the calculated number.
