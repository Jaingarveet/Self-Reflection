Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the slope of the function. 
I correctly identified the y-intercept, but I made a mistake in calculating the slope.
Error Keywords:
 - Slope calculation error
 - Linear function analysis error
Solution:
The table shows that the function increases by 3 each time $n$ increases by 1.
This means the slope of the function is 3.
The table also shows that when $n=1$, $f(n)=-2$.
This means the y-intercept of the function is $-2$.
Therefore, the equation of the function is $f(n)=3n-2$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the change in $f(n)$ for each increase of 1 in $n$.
2. Calculate the slope of the function by dividing the change in $f(n)$ by the change in $n$.
3. Identify the value of $f(n)$ when $n$ is equal to the first value in the table.
4. Calculate the y-intercept of the function by subtracting the product of the slope and the first value of $n$ from the first value of $f(n)$.
5. Write the equation of the function in slope-intercept form: $f(n)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
Advice:
 - When analyzing linear functions, pay close attention to the change in the output value for each change in the input value.
 - Remember that the slope of a linear function represents the rate of change of the function.
 - Remember that the y-intercept of a linear function represents the value of the function when the input value is zero.
 - Always double-check your calculations and reasoning before selecting your final answer.
