Instructions:

1. Recognize that potential energy is energy that has the potential to do work, while kinetic energy is energy of motion.
2. Identify the correct type of energy for each option:
	* Sound energy is a type of kinetic energy (it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance).
	* Radiant energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work).
	* Chemical energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work through chemical reactions).
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.
