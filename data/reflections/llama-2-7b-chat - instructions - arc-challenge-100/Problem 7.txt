Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for finding distance traveled: distance = speed x time
2. Use the given information to calculate the speed of the geese: speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = [REDACTED]/day
3. Calculate the distance traveled on the first day: distance = speed x days = [REDACTED]/day x 1 day = [REDACTED]
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
