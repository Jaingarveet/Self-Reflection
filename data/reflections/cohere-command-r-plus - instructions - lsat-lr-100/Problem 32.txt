Instructions:
1. Identify the central claim or argument presented in the editorial. 
2. Recognize the apparent inconsistency highlighted by the editorial regarding the political party's stance on education spending. 
3. Understand that the question seeks to identify the assumption underlying the editorial's argument. 
4. Analyze each answer choice critically: 
   - Choice 'A' misrepresents the editorial's focus by emphasizing the actions of a legislator rather than the party's overall stance. 
   - Choice 'B' introduces a red herring by bringing up long-term spending reduction, which is unrelated to the editorial's argument. 
   - Choice 'C' shifts the discussion to moral goals and actions, which is irrelevant to the specific issue of policy consistency. 
   - Choice 'D' accurately reflects the editorial's assumption that a consistent policy does not require acting on every stated goal. 
   - Choice 'E' contradicts the editorial's observation of inconsistent views within the political party. 

5. Select choice 'D' as the correct answer.
