Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's conclusion and its key elements (e.g., maintaining educational quality, increasing enrollment, aggressive marketing). 
2. Understand the relationship between the argument's premises and conclusion (e.g., increasing enrollment prevents spending cuts). 
3. Recognize that the correct answer will likely address the broader context of the argument, not just a single element (e.g., Choice [REDACTED] addresses quality, spending, and their relationship). 
4. Evaluate each choice based on these criteria, selecting the assumption that best supports the argument's conclusion.
