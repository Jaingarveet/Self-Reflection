Instructions:
1. Focus on the judge's statement about the defendant's charge: "since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes."
2. Understand the context: the defendant is arguing that they were unsure which codes applied, national or local.
3. Recognize the key principle: the relationship between national and local codes and how they apply to charges of noncompliance.
4. Identify the answer choice that reflects this relationship: national code requirements are also required by local codes.
5. Avoid the trap of focusing solely on the defendant's ignorance, which is a red herring in this case.
