Instructions:
1. Identify the key premise of the argument: most employees will have longer commutes after the move. 
2. Recognize the condition required for this premise to hold true: employees' financial situation must remain largely unchanged. 
3. Understand that the absence of a significant pay raise ensures employees cannot afford housing for shorter commutes. 
4. Choose the answer option that reflects this absence of a pay raise.
