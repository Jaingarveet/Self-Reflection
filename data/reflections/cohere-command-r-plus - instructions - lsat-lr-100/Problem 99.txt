Instructions:
1. Understand the professor's argument: freedom of thought alone is insufficient for intellectual progress due to the need for intellectual discipline. 
2. Identify the key assumptions and implications: the role of discipline in exploring interrelated ideas and the potential negative consequences of unrestrained freedom. 
3. Analyze each choice: 
- [REDACTED]: While related to intellectual progress, this choice focuses on orthodoxy, which is not directly relevant to the argument. 
- [REDACTED]: Introduces societal values, which are not part of the professor's argument. 
- **C**: Directly contradicts the professor's assertion, implying that freedom of thought leads to a lack of discipline. 
- [REDACTED]: Discusses a benefit of freedom of thought, but ignores the role of intellectual discipline. 
- [REDACTED]: Aligns with the idea that discipline is foundational to freedom of thought, but does not capture the societal context. 

4. Choose the answer that best reflects the assumption underlying the professor's conclusion.
