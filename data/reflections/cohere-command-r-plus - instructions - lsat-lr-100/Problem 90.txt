Instructions:
1. Understand the context: The journalist is explaining the characteristics of brown dwarfs and how they differ from stars and planets in terms of mass and lithium presence. 
2. Interpret the information: Lithium is a key indicator of the functionality of a celestial object's nuclear furnace, which is directly related to its mass. 
3. Evaluate each choice: 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because the absence of lithium could be due to other factors, such as the object being a brown dwarf or having a different formation history. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because stars more massive than the Sun also have lithium, but their elements are thoroughly mixed due to higher temperatures and pressures. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is correct because it captures the key distinction; only brown dwarfs are expected to retain lithium, so the absence of lithium means an object is not a brown dwarf. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect as it is overly broad and misleading. While brown dwarfs with lithium do have less mass than the Sun, other objects with lithium may fall into different categories. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because it focuses solely on the mass of the object, ignoring the critical role of lithium presence in distinguishing brown dwarfs. 
4. Choose the best answer: Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer as it is the most accurate and specific inference supported by the journalist's statements.
