Instructions:
1. Understand the study finding: similar blood nicotine levels despite varying cigarette nicotine content. 
2. Identify the critical detail: the role of the "lowest-nicotine cigarettes available." 
3. Evaluate each choice: 
    - [REDACTED]: Explains the cap on blood nicotine levels. 
    - [REDACTED]: Misleading; doesn't specify if they smoke more of the *lowest-nicotine* cigarettes. 
    - [REDACTED]: Irrelevant to the study; doesn't explain similar blood levels. 
    - [REDACTED]: Unrelated to nicotine absorption. 
    - [REDACTED]: True, but irrelevant to the study's findings. 
4. Choose the answer that directly addresses the study's scope and findings.
