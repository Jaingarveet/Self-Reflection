Instructions:
1. Identify the principle illustrated in the argument: illegally obtained evidence is inadmissible. 
2. Understand the correct legal concept: focus on the means of obtaining evidence, not the use of information or separate wrongdoings. 
3. Analyze each choice: look for situations where information is obtained through illegal or improper means, directly impacting the justifiability of punitive action. 
4. Evaluate the choices based on the correct legal principle: choose the scenario where the response is not justifiable due to the inadmissibility of the evidence. 
5. Avoid misinterpretation: do not apply unrelated legal doctrines, and stay focused on the key details of the argument and choices.
