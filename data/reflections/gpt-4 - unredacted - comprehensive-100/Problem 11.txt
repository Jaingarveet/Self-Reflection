Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the logic behind the assertion. I focused on the alternative explanation provided in option D, rather than looking for the option that most directly contradicts the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logic error
- Assertion contradiction
Solution:
The assertion is that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices. 
Option B is the most doubtful of this assertion because it shows a situation where housing prices increased significantly (7.2%) while the increase in land prices was minimal (0.37%). This contradicts the assertion that rising land prices are the main cause of soaring housing prices.
Instructions:
1. Understand the assertion made in the question.
2. Evaluate each option in relation to the assertion.
3. Look for the option that most directly contradicts the assertion.
4. The option that shows a significant difference in the correlation implied by the assertion is the most doubtful.
Advice:
- Always understand the assertion or claim made in the question.
- Evaluate each option in relation to the assertion, not in isolation.
- Look for contradictions to the assertion in the options.
- The option that most directly contradicts the assertion is the most doubtful.
- Don't be distracted by alternative explanations that don't directly address the assertion.
