Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the second constraint. I thought that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, but the constraint actually means that there must be at least two other businesses between the two restaurants. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension
- Logical reasoning
Solution:
Re-evaluating the choices with the correct understanding of the constraints:
A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
- This choice violates the third constraint because the pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
- This choice violates the third constraint because the pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
- This choice violates the third constraint because the pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
- This choice violates the third constraint because the pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
- This choice meets all the constraints.
