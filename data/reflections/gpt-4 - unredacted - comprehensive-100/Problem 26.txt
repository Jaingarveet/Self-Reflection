Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the constraints. I assumed that the pharmacy had to be in space 1 because the shoe store was in space 2. However, the constraints only state that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, not necessarily next to the shoe store. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Constraint misunderstanding
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Given the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The shoe store is in space 2, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because it would not be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so a restaurant cannot be in space 3. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 4, the toy store cannot be in space 6. Therefore, the only possible option is that the optometrist is in space 5.
Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints of the problem.
2. Identify the fixed positions (in this case, the shoe store in space 2).
3. Apply the constraints to the fixed positions.
4. Eliminate options that do not meet the constraints.
5. Choose the answer that fits all the constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the question and constraints carefully.
- Understand the implications of each constraint.
- Use a process of elimination to narrow down the options.
- Double-check your understanding of the constraints and your application of them.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills.
