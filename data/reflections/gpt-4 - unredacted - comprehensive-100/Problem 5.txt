Explanation:
I made a mistake in solving the equation. I incorrectly calculated the value of n, which represents the number of members in the club. 
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Solving equations
Solution:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 250 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.25) and solve for n.
Solving this equation gives n = 25.
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and identify the given values.
2. Write down the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d).
3. Substitute the given values into the formula.
4. Solve the equation for n, which represents the number of members in the club.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Be careful when solving equations, and double-check your calculations.
- Remember the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and how to apply it.
- Practice solving similar problems to improve your skills and accuracy.
