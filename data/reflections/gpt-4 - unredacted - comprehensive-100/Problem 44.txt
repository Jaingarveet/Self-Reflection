Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the critics' argument. I focused on the idea that understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study is done solely from the perspective of the majority culture, which led me to choose the answer that emphasized multiple cultural perspectives. However, the critics' main point was that the values of a culture arise from its unique social and historical circumstances, which is best reflected in answer B.
