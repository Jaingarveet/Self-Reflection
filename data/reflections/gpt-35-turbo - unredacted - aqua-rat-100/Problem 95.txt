Explanation:
I made a calculation error while calculating the concentration of tea after the second replacement. 
I forgot to subtract the percentage of milk from the resultant solution.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Concentration error
Solution:
John replaces 15% of 50% strong milk tea twice, which means he replaces 7.5% of tea with milk twice.
After the first replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 42.5%.
After the second replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 36.125%.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
The concentration of tea becomes 32.5125%.
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial concentration of tea.
2. Identify the percentage of milk John replaces twice.
3. Calculate the concentration of tea after the first replacement.
4. Calculate the concentration of tea after the second replacement.
5. Calculate the concentration of tea after the third replacement.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that concentration is the amount of solute divided by the total amount of solution.
