Explanation:
I made an error in my understanding of the problem. 
I incorrectly assumed that the measure of minor arc AB is equal to the measure of minor arc BC. 
The correct assumption is that the measure of minor arc AB is half the measure of minor arc AC. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the problem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpreting the question
Solution:
If B bisects minor arc AC, then the measure of minor arc AB is half the measure of minor arc AC.
The measure of minor arc AC is 160°, so the measure of minor arc AB is 80°.
The measure of minor arc BD is 150°.
The sum of the measures of minor arc AC and minor arc BD is equal to the circumference of the circle.
Let x be the measure of minor arc AD.
Then, x + 80° + 150° = 360° (the circumference of the circle)
Solving for x, we get x = 130°.
