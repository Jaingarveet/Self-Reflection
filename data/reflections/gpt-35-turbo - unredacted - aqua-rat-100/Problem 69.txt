Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the value of Both. 
I incorrectly calculated Neither as -5, which led to an incorrect value for Both. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
We can use the formula: 
Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither
We know that:
Group 1 (hardcover) = 30
Group 2 (fiction) = 20
Total = 45
We need to find Both (hardcover and fiction)
Neither = Total - (Group 1 + Group 2) = 45 - (30 + 20) = 45 - 50 = 0
We can now solve for Both:
Both = Group 1 + Group 2 - Total + Neither = 30 + 20 - 45 + 0 = 5
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the groups and the total number of items.
3. Use the formula Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither.
4. Solve for Neither by subtracting the sum of Group 1 and Group 2 from the Total.
5. If Neither is negative, set it to zero.
6. Solve for Both by rearranging the formula to Both = Group 1 + Group 2 - Total + Neither.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Be careful when subtracting or adding numbers.
