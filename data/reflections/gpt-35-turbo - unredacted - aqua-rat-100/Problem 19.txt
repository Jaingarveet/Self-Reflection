Explanation:
I made an error in equating the two equations. 
The equation for the forward journey is correct, but the equation for the return journey is incorrect. 
The correct equation for the return journey is D = (S+12) x 4, not D = (S-12) x 4.
Error Keywords:
 - Equation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Calculation error
Solution:
Let's use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
Let's assume the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is S km/hr.
On the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (S+12) km/hr.
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is D km.
Using the formula, we can create two equations:
Forward journey: D = S x 6
Return journey: D = (S+12) x 4
We can solve for D by equating the two equations:
S x 6 = (S+12) x 4
6S = 4S + 48
2S = 48
S = 24
Substituting S=24 into the forward journey equation:
D = S x 6 = 24 x 6 = 144 km
Instructions:
1. Identify the speed of the jeep on the forward journey.
2. Identify the speed of the jeep on the return journey.
3. Identify the time taken for the jeep on the forward journey.
4. Identify the time taken for the jeep on the return journey.
5. Use the formula Distance = Speed x Time to create two equations.
6. Equate the two equations to solve for the distance.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use a systematic approach to solve problems.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that algebraic equations must be balanced on both sides.
