Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider the possibility of using a pair of the same letters to represent a type of book. 
If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she will need 10 letters. 
If she uses a pair of two different letters, she will need to choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first letter, and 1 letter out of 25 for the second letter (since the order of letters in a pair does not matter). This gives us 26*25/2 = 325 possible pairs. 
If she uses a pair of the same letters, she will need to choose 1 letter out of 26. This gives us 26 possible pairs. 
Therefore, the total number of unique codes needed is 10. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.
3. Double-check your calculations and reasoning.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.
 - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and reasoning.
 - Remember that the smallest number of something is not always the most obvious or intuitive answer.
