Explanation:
I used the wrong formula to solve the problem. Instead of using the formula that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM, I used the formula that the LCM of two numbers is equal to their product divided by their GCF. 
Error Keywords:
 - Formula error
 - Computation error
 - Division error
Solution:
The GCF of two numbers is 11.
The LCM of two numbers is 7700.
One of the numbers is 350.
We can find the other number by dividing the product of 350 and 7700 by 350 and then dividing by 11.
The other number is (350*7700)/350/11 = 700.
Instructions:
1. Identify the GCF and LCM of the two numbers.
2. Identify one of the two numbers.
3. Use the formula that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM to find the other number.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula to solve the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM.
