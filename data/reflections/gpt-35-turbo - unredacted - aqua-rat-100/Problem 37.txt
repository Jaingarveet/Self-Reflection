Explanation:
I made a calculation error while solving the equation (51x + 78)/(x+1) = 54. 
I did not distribute the 54 to the denominator (x+1) while solving the equation.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Equation-solving error
Solution:
Let's assume that Sachin played 'x' matches in the season before the finals.
Then, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season before the finals = 51x
After the finals, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season = 51x + 78
Also, we know that the batting average after the finals is 54.
So, (51x + 78)/(x+1) = 54
Solving this equation, we get x = 8
Therefore, Sachin played 8 matches in the season before the finals.
So, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season = 8 + 1 (finals) = 9
