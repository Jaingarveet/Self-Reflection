Explanation:
My approach to the problem was incorrect. I assumed that Alex and Jacob made x toys and (35 - x) toys respectively, which is not correct. Also, I did not use the given information that both of them worked for almost similar hours. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Incorrect approach
 - Ignoring given information
Solution:
Let's assume that Alex and Jacob made a toys and b toys respectively.
The time taken by Alex and Jacob to make a toys and b toys respectively can be calculated using the formula: Time = (Work / Rate)
Let's assume that Alex worked for t hours and Jacob worked for (t + d) hours.
Using the above information, we can form two equations and solve for d.
Equation 1: t/7 + (t + d)/9 = 35
Equation 2: a + b = 35
Solving equation 1 for t, we get t = (315 - 4d)/23
Substituting t in equation 2, we get a = (23*35 - 9d)/23 = 35 - (9d/23)
Since both of them worked for almost similar hours, we can assume that the difference in their working hours is negligible. Therefore, we can assume that d is very small compared to 315. 
Using this approximation, we can solve for d as follows:
t = (315 - 4d)/23 = (315/23) - (4d/23)
Substituting this value of t in equation 1, we get:
(315/161) - (4d/161) + [(315/161) - (4d/161) + d]/9 = 35/161
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
d = 17
Substituting d = 17 in the equation for a, we get:
a = 35 - (9d/23) = 15
Therefore, Jacob made 20 toys.
