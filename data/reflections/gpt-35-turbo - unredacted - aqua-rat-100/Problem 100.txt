Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the perimeter of the rectangular piece. 
I correctly calculated the length and breadth of the rectangular piece but made an error in the final calculation of the perimeter. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Perimeter error
 - Addition error
Solution:
Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is "x" meters.
Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) meters.
We know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m.
So, x(4x + 1) = 150
Simplifying the above equation, we get 4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
We can solve this quadratic equation to find the value of x.
Once we have the value of x, we can calculate the length and perimeter of the rectangular piece.
Solving the quadratic equation, we get x = 5 or x = -7.5
Since the breadth cannot be negative, we will consider x = 5.
So, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 = 21 meters.
The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(length + breadth) = 2(21 + 5) = 52 meters.
