Explanation:
My thought process was correct, but I made a calculation error.
The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.56 x 0.74 = 0.4144.
The probability that at least one of the events will occur is 1 - 0.4144 = 0.5856.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.5856 = 0.4144.
The correct answer is B.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Probability error
Solution:
The probability that neither of the two events will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that at least one of the events will occur.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is when the probability of both events occurring is the highest.
The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.56 x 0.74 = 0.4144.
The probability that at least one of the events will occur is 1 - 0.4144 = 0.5856.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.5856 = 0.4144.
Instructions:
1. Identify the probabilities of the events occurring.
2. Calculate the probability of both events occurring by multiplying their individual probabilities.
3. Calculate the probability of at least one of the events occurring by subtracting the probability of neither event occurring from 1.
4. Calculate the probability of neither event occurring by subtracting the probability of at least one of the events occurring from 1.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the probability of an event occurring is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive.
