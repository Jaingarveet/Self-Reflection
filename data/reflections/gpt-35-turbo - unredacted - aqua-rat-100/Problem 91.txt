Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the distance travelled towards south and north would cancel each other out, and the distance travelled towards east and west would cancel each other out. However, this is not true because the distances travelled towards south and north are not equal, and the distances travelled towards east and west are not equal. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misapplication of Pythagoras theorem
 - Misunderstanding of the problem
Solution:
We can use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
The distance travelled towards south and north will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards east and west will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards south is 3 km.
The distance travelled towards north is 3 km.
The distance travelled towards east is 5 km.
The distance travelled towards west is 2 km.
The net distance travelled towards south is 3 km - 3 km = 0 km.
The net distance travelled towards east is 5 km - 2 km = 3 km.
The distance between the starting point and the final point is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 km and 3 km.
Using Pythagoras theorem, we get:
distance^2 = 3^2 + 3^2
distance^2 = 18
distance = sqrt(18) = 3sqrt(2)
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the distances travelled towards south, north, east, and west.
3. Calculate the net distance travelled towards south and north.
4. Calculate the net distance travelled towards east and west.
5. Use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
 - Always use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between two points in a right-angled triangle.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
