Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the total journey duration. I added the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance and the time taken to cover the remaining distance, but I forgot to add the time taken during the rain. 
Error Keywords:
 - Addition error
 - Calculation error
 - Time calculation error
Solution:
Let's first calculate the total distance of the journey.
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 100 x 10 = 1000 miles
When the train covers a quarter of the distance, it has traveled 1000/4 = 250 miles.
Now, the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles.
Let's calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 750 / 75 = 10 hours
When it starts raining, the train has already traveled for 250 miles at a speed of 100 miles/hour. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles/hour is:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 750 / 75 = 10 hours
The total journey duration is the sum of the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance, the time taken to cover the remaining distance, and the time taken during the rain.
Total journey duration = 10 + 10 + 0.5 = 20.5 hours
