Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation for the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers when checking the number 41.
The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from 41 is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10.
The correct calculation for the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Divisibility error
Solution:
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers can be expressed as 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
Since the numbers are odd, x must be an odd number.
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is always divisible by 5.
If the sum is divisible by 10, then the last digit of the sum must be 0.
The only perfect square that ends in 0 is 100.
Therefore, the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers must be a multiple of 100.
Let's check which of the given numbers can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Starting with the smallest number, 41. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 41 + 43 + 45 + 47 + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10. So, 41 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking 44. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 + 52 = 240, which is divisible by 10. So, 44 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking 47. The sum of the next 4 consecutive odd numbers is 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255, which is not divisible by 10. So, 47 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking 67. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 59 + 61 + 63 + 65 + 67 = 315, which is divisible by 10. So, 67 can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
Checking 91. The sum of the previous 4 consecutive odd numbers is 75 + 77 + 79 + 81 + 83 = 395, which is not divisible by 10. So, 91 cannot be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
