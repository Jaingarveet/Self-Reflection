Explanation:
I correctly identified that Roy has to take 5 tablets with a gap of 15 minutes between each tablet. However, I made a calculation error while multiplying the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets. 
The correct calculation is 15 minutes x 4 = 60 minutes.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
Roy has to take 5 tablets with a gap of 15 minutes between each tablet.
To find the total time, we need to multiply the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets.
The time gap between each tablet is 15 minutes.
The number of tablets is 5.
The total time taken to consume all the tablets is 15 minutes x 4 = 60 minutes.
Instructions:
1. Identify the time gap between each tablet.
2. Identify the number of tablets.
3. Multiply the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets.
4. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
