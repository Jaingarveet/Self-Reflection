Solution:
The question describes a scenario where a man is flying kites in an auditorium. The most logical completion would involve the man continuing to fly the kites, with the audience watching. However, the correct answer also introduces a new element - a woman speaking to the crowd and the man walking away at the end. This is plausible as it could be a part of a show or presentation.
