Solution:
To find the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day, we need to divide the number of days by 2. Since the work took 6 days to complete, we can divide 6 by 2 to get the number of men required to complete the work in 1/2 day:

6 days / 2 = 3 men

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
