Solution:
To find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10 oranges, we need to use the principle of permutations. There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we need to arrange 2 of them in a particular order. Therefore, the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from the basket is:

10C2 = 10 Ã— 9 = [REDACTED]
