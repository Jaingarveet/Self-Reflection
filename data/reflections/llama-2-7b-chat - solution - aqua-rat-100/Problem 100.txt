Solution:
The perimeter of a rectangle is found by adding the lengths of all four sides. The correct equation is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Since the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, we can set up the equation:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Now, we can substitute the value of Length in terms of [REDACTED]:

Length = 4[REDACTED] + 1

Perimeter = 2(4[REDACTED] + 1)

Perimeter = 8[REDACTED] + 2

Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is [REDACTED] (Answer: C).
