Solution:
To arrange the books on a shelf, we need to consider the number of books in each category and the order in which they will be placed.

1. English books: 5
2. Hindi books: 3
3. Mathematics books: 4
4. History books: 3
5. Geography books: 3
6. Science books: 4

There are 7 books in total, so the number of ways to arrange them on a shelf is:
