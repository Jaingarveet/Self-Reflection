Solution:
Using the correct assumption, we can solve for the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction:

Total number of books = 45
Number of hardcover books = [REDACTED]
Number of fiction books = [REDACTED]

Maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction = Total number of books - (Number of hardcover books + Number of fiction books)
= 45 - ([REDACTED] + [REDACTED])
= 45 - 50
= -5

Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 0.
