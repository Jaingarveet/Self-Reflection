Solution:
The group has 64 boys and 40 girls, for a total of 104 members.

Let's use the ratio of boys to girls to find the total number of members in the group:

Number of boys = 64 x 4 = 256
Number of girls = 40 x 3 = 120

Total number of members = Number of boys + Number of girls = 256 + 120 = 376

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].
