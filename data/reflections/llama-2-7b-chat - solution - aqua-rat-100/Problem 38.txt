Solution:
The hollow cube has a size of 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm, making the volume of the cube 5cm x 5cm x 1cm = 25 cm³.
The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1cm, so the number of smaller cubes that can fit inside the hollow cube is 25 cm³ / 1 cm³ = 25.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 25 - 6 (faces of the smaller cubes that are not painted) = 19.
