Solution:
The man borrowed Rs.360.
He will pay it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50.
The interest rate is the amount of interest paid per year, divided by the amount borrowed.
The interest rate can be calculated by dividing the amount borrowed by the number of installments and the installment amount:
Interest rate = (Amount borrowed / Number of installments) x (Installment amount / 12)

Using the given values:
Interest rate = (Rs.360 / 12) x (Rs.31.50 / 12)
Interest rate = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED].
