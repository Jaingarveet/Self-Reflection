Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar. This is an example of increasing returns to scale because as the size of the bee colony increases, the productivity of each bee also increases, leading to more output per bee.
