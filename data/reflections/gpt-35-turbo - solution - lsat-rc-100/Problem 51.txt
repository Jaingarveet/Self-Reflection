Solution:
The sentences at lines 28-31 express the author's opinion that defense lawyers should not take cases where they know their clients are guilty. The author believes that lawyers have a duty to the court and society, and that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. The sentence at lines 7-11 reports the opinion of other legal scholars that defense lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, without judging the defendant's guilt or innocence. The author disagrees with this position and believes that lawyers have a twofold obligation to the defendant and to the court/society.
