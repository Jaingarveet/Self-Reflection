Solution:
Passage [REDACTED] argues that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and has long been considered reliable, and that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. The trial court below was therefore within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage [REDACTED], on the other hand, argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study. The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
