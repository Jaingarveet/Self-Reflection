Solution:
The passage describes two sides of a debate on how to deter deliberate crimes, and then introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions. The economic principle is used to analyze the decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice, and to show that the two deterrence methods have the same overall effect. Therefore, the most accurate description of the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
