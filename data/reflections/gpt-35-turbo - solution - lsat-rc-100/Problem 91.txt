Solution:
The author of Passage [REDACTED] argues that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique that can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion. The plan described in Passage [REDACTED] involves selectively cutting water to residences with outstanding bills, which could be seen as an example of overenforcement. While the author of Passage [REDACTED] does not explicitly comment on this plan, they would likely agree with the statement that the plan has a lower social cost than turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time. However, the author would also likely argue that a better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills, as this would be a more effective method of collecting debts and would not involve the social costs of turning off water to households.
