Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because the passage notes that Marshall's techniques have become the norm for U.S. public interest litigation today, and that they lend themselves to being used even for purposes that Marshall might not have intended. The passage does not state that the first public interest law firms were established in response to Marshall's successes in NAACP litigations, as answer choice [REDACTED] suggests.
