Solution:
The author suggests that pre-contact Native American cultures had a markedly inclusive idea of self, which was not merely individual but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos.

[REDACTED] pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation. This suggests that the identity of the person is not just individual but also relational to the cosmos.
