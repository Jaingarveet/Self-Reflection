Solution:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. The strongest objection to this criticism would be a statement that shows that the second version of multicultural education is essentially different from the first version. Option [REDACTED] does not provide such an objection.
