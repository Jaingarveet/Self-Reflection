Solution:
The passage mentions that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills. It also mentions that officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. The passage does not provide any information about the frequency of turning off the water of customers who were late paying their water bills.
