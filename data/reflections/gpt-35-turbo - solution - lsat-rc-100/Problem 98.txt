Solution:
The author suggests that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies. The author also discusses how the economic principle of utility maximization can be used to analyze the rational decision-making process of individuals who commit crimes. The author does not discuss the rate of recidivism, so it is not possible to determine the author's position on the statement that the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to fall if laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders are adopted. The author does suggest that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases.
