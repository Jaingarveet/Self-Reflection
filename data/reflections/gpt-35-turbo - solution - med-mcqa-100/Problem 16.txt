Solution:
In obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery, the anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery will maintain the blood supply of the upper limb. The scapular anastomosis is formed by the subscapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery, which anastomose around the scapula to provide collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
