Solution:
Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed based on laboratory findings. The most sensitive and specific tests for iron deficiency anemia are decreased serum ferritin and increased TIB[REDACTED]. The transferrin ferritin index is calculated by dividing TIB[REDACTED] by serum ferritin. 
Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it includes both decreased serum ferritin and increased TIB[REDACTED], which are the most sensitive and specific tests for iron deficiency anemia.
