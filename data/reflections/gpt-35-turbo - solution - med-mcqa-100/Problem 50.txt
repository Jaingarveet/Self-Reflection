Solution:
The right suprarenal vein drains the adrenal gland and joins the inferior vena cava directly.
The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body to the heart.
The renal vein drains the kidney and joins the inferior vena cava, but not directly.
The superior mesenteric vein and inferior mesenteric vein drain the intestines and join to form the portal vein, which then enters the liver.
