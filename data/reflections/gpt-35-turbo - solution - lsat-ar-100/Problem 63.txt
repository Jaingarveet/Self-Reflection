Solution:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon. 
Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on either Thursday or Friday. 
Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on either Wednesday or Thursday. 
Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on either Wednesday or Thursday. 
Therefore, we know the schedule for [REDACTED] lab assistants: Julio, Olivia, and either Kevin or Rebecca.
