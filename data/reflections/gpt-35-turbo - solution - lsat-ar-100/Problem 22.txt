Solution:
If both G and H are selected, then we can't select F, K, and M together. 
If we select F, then we can't select more than one zoologist. 
If we select K, then we can't select M. 
If we select M, then we must select both P and R. 
If we select H, then we can't select F and M together. 
Therefore, the panel must include either F or K.
