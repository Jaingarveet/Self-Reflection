Solution:
If Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday, then Iturbe must testify on Wednesday. 
Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because Hong does not testify on Monday. 
Franco cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness testifies on Monday and Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia. 
Therefore, Franco must testify on Tuesday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday. 
Hong must testify on Monday.
