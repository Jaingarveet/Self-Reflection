Solution:
We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Tuesday. Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, and Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
If Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday, then George must give the morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, George cannot give the morning report on Monday or Wednesday. 
If Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday, then Nina cannot give the morning report on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give the morning report on Monday or Tuesday. 
If Nina gives the morning report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. 
If Nina gives the morning report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Robert and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday. 
Therefore, the list of students who give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be [REDACTED].
