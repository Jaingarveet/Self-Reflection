Solution:
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke must be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia. 
If Novetzke is assigned to Venezuela, then Jaramillo cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. 
If Novetzke is assigned to Zambia, then Landon cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship. 
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia. 
Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
