Solution:
If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 5.
Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
Using these restrictions, we can eliminate the pairs of days that cannot feature the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.
For example, we know that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so we can eliminate answer choice [REDACTED].
We also know that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, so we can eliminate answer choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it is the only pair of days that violates the restriction that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
