Solution:
We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and M could be on any shelf together. Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that at least three books are on the bottom shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other if and only if they are both on the bottom shelf.
