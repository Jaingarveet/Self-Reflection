Solution:
Bay 4 is adjacent to the bay holding [REDACTED].
The bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED].
The bay holding [REDACTED] must be in bay 3 or 5.
If bay 3 holds [REDACTED], then bay 4 holds [REDACTED], and bay 5 holds [REDACTED].
If bay 5 holds [REDACTED], then bay 4 holds [REDACTED], and bay 3 holds [REDACTED].
Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be held in bay 4.
