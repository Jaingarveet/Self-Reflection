Solution:
To solve the problem, I need to consider all the constraints in the problem. 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. 
If Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions, then the possible combinations of lab assistants and lab sessions are:
- Wednesday morning: Julio, Kevin, (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca)
- Thursday morning: Julio, Kevin, (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca)
- Friday morning: (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, Rebecca), Julio, Kevin
Now, I need to check each answer choice to see which one is not possible:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Not possible because Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Olivia, and Olivia's session must be on a later day than Julio's.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] Possible.
Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED].
