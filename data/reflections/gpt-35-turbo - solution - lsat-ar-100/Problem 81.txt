Solution:
The organizer will select at least 5 and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.
No more than 4 French works are selected.
At least 3 but no more than 4 novels are selected.
At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Option [REDACTED] is possible because the organizer could select all four French works and only one of the three Russian novels, which would satisfy all of the requirements.
