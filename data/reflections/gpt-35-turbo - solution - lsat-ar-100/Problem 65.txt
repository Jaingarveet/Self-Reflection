Solution:
If M is the only chemist selected, then P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
H cannot be selected because it would violate the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
Therefore, both F and G must be selected, and no zoologist can be selected. 
Thus, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
