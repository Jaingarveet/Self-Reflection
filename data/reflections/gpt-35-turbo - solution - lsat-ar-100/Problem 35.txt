Solution:
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies. This means that the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday. Also, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This leaves only Monday and Wednesday for the remaining batches. Since we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, it is possible that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, statement [REDACTED] could be false.
