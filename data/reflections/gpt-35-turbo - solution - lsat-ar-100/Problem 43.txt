Solution:
If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and H must be fourth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and H must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
If S is third, then Q must be first or second, which means G must be first or second, respectively. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
Therefore, if Y is fourth, S must be second, Q must be third, G must be first, H must be fifth, R must be sixth, and J must be seventh. This means that J is second, not third.
