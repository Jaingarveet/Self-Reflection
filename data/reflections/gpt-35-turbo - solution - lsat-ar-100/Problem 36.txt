Solution:
If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day. 
Theresa must be one of the testers for H. 
Therefore, Reynaldo and Seamus must test F and G, but it is not clear which one of them tests which bicycle. 
If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test G on the first day, and Reynaldo must test F on the first day. 
On the second day, Reynaldo tests G, Seamus tests J, Yuki tests F, and Theresa tests H.
