Solution:
If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports.
George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give the morning or afternoon report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports.
Therefore, Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday, but not both.
