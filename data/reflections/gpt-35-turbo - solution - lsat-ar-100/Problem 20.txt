Solution:
We need to determine which students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. But since George is already giving a report on Tuesday, Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
Since Kyle and Lenore are not giving reports, Helen, Irving, and Robert must give reports on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, Olivia must give a report on Wednesday.
Thus, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by [REDACTED].
