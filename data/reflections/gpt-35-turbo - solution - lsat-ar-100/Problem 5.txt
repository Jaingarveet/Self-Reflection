Solution:
More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
I is placed on the middle shelf.
K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Option [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because O could be on the same shelf as M, which is not the top shelf.
Option [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because G could be on the same shelf as K, which is not the top shelf.
Option [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because F could be on the same shelf as I, which is not the top shelf.
Option [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because O could be on the same shelf as M, which is not the top shelf.
Option [REDACTED] must be true because we know that O is on a higher shelf than L, and F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and L cannot be on the same shelf, and F must be on a higher shelf than L.
