Solution:
We need to follow the given conditions to determine the order of compositions.
T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
O is performed either first or fifth.
The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
P is performed at some time before S.
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Option [REDACTED] does not satisfy the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
Option [REDACTED] does not satisfy the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
Option [REDACTED] does not satisfy the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
Option [REDACTED] satisfies all the given conditions.
Option [REDACTED] does not satisfy the condition that P is performed at some time before S.
