Solution:
We know that P is performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] position because S is performed after P. If P is performed in the [REDACTED] position, then S must be performed in the eighth position, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the [REDACTED] position. The only remaining option is the fifth position, which satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, P cannot be performed in the fifth position.
