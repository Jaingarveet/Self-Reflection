Solution:
If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Franco can testify on Monday or Wednesday. 
If Franco testifies on Monday, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday. 
If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Iturbe cannot testify on Wednesday because Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday. 
Garcia cannot testify on Monday because Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Tuesday.
The only remaining day for Iturbe to testify is Wednesday.
