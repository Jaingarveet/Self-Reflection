Solution:
We need to find a target that cannot be set for more than one client.
Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
Option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], cannot be set for Truvest because its voicemail target must be 1 day or shorter, and its website target must be shorter than Solide's website target.
