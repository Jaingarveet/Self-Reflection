Solution:
The constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses means that there must be at least two businesses between the two restaurants.
Option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] do not address the issue of having at least two businesses between the two restaurants.
Option [REDACTED] is irrelevant to the constraint.
Option [REDACTED] addresses the issue of having no more than two businesses between the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it, which has the same effect as having at least two businesses between the two restaurants.
