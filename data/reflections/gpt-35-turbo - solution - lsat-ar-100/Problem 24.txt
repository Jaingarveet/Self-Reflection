Solution:
The constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne means that if Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne may or may not be assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which states that [REDACTED] This constraint has the same effect as the original constraint because it still allows for the possibility that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, but it also allows for the possibility that Kayne is not assigned to an ambassadorship if Novetzke is assigned to an ambassadorship.
