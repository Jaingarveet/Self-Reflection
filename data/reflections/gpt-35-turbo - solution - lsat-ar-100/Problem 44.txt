Solution:
If Himalayans are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on days 2, 3, or 4.
Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
Newfoundlands can be featured on days 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
Based on these conditions, the only option that could be true is that Rottweilers are featured only on day 3 (option D).
