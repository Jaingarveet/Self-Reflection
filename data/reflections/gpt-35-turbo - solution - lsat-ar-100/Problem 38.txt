Solution:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
I is placed on the middle shelf, so K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be placed on the bottom shelf as well.
Therefore, the books placed on the middle shelf are I, K, and L.
