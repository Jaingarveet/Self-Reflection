Solution:
We can start by using the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices:
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. (Eliminates answer choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and E)
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. (Eliminates answer choices [REDACTED] and D)
Now, we can try to create a schedule based on the remaining answer choices (C):
- Mon. morning: Lenore; Mon. afternoon: Helen
- Tues. morning: George; Tues. afternoon: Kyle
- Wed. morning: Robert; Wed. afternoon: Irving
This schedule satisfies all of the given conditions:
- Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
