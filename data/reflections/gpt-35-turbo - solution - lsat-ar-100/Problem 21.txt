Solution:
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. Therefore, [REDACTED] must be assigned to Zambia and Yemen, respectively. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships. Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively. Finally, Landon must be assigned to Zambia. Thus, the other two ambassadors assigned could be [REDACTED].
