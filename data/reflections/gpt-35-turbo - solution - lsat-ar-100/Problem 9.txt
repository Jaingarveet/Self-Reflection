Solution:
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, Robertson must be assigned parking space #3, and Xu must be assigned parking space #4. Therefore, [REDACTED] could be true.
