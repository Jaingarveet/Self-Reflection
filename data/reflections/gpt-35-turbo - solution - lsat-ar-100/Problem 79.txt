Solution:
If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4. 
If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
If the bay holding livestock is in bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 4. 
If the bay holding livestock is in bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 3. 
If the bay holding produce is in bay 4, then bay 5 must hold textiles and bay 3 must hold livestock. 
If the bay holding produce is in bay 3, then bay 5 must hold textiles and bay 4 must hold livestock. 
Therefore, bay 4 cannot hold textiles if the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
