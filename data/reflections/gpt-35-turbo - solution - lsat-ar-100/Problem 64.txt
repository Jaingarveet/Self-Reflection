Solution:
If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, Quinn must also work in Zone 3. That means Kim must work in Zone 2.
