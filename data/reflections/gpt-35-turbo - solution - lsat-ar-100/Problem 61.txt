Solution:
If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
If Jaramillo is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne must also be assigned to Zambia.
If Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke must be assigned to one of the other two countries.
If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
If Landon is assigned to Zambia, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to Zambia.
Therefore, Novetzke cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
