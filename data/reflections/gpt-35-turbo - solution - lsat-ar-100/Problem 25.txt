Solution:
If G is fourth, then J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J could be first, second, or third, and G could be second or third. 
S must be earlier than Y, so S must be fifth or sixth. 
Q is third or later. 
H must be first, second, or third. 
Therefore, Y could be sixth, and H could be fifth.
