Solution:
If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 3.
The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 3.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 2.
Therefore, the optometrist could be in space 5, and choice [REDACTED] is correct.
