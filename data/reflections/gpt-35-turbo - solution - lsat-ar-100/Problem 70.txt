Solution:
If Solide's voicemail target is shorter than [REDACTED], then [REDACTED] must be shorter than [REDACTED]. 
If [REDACTED] is 2 days, then [REDACTED] could be 2 days or 1 day. 
[REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so [REDACTED] must be 1 day. 
Therefore, [REDACTED] could be 2 days, but [REDACTED] could also be 2 days.
