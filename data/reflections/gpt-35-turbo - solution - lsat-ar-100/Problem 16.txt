Solution:
There are six lab assistants and six lab sessions, so each assistant will lead one session in the morning and one in the afternoon. 
The constraints are:
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
- Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
- Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Option [REDACTED] satisfies all the constraints.
Option [REDACTED] violates the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
