## Explanation:
My initial analysis of the answer choices was correct in identifying options B and D as employing a similar modus tollens structure to the original argument. However, I erred in prioritizing option B based on the superficial similarity of objects and properties. The core of the logical structure, which is the focus of the question, aligns more closely with option D. 
## Error Keywords:
* Superficial similarity
* Object-property focus
* Modus tollens structure
## Solution:
1. **Identify the logical structure:** The original argument is a modus tollens, with the form:
    * All P are Q
    * Not Q
    * Therefore, not P
2. **Analyze answer choices:**
    * A: Modus ponens, not similar.
    * B: Modus tollens, similar in structure but not in object-property focus.
    * C: Modus ponens, not similar.
    * D: Modus tollens, similar in both structure and object-property focus.
3. **Choose the answer that best reflects the logical structure:** Option D aligns most closely with the modus tollens structure of the original argument.
## Instructions:
1. **Focus on the logical structure:** Prioritize identifying the type of logical reasoning employed in the original argument.
2. **Analyze answer choices based on structure:** Evaluate each answer choice based on its adherence to the identified logical structure, not just superficial similarities.
3. **Consider object-property focus:** If applicable, assess whether the objects and properties in the answer choices align with those in the original argument.
4. **Choose the answer that best reflects the overall logic:** Select the answer that most closely mirrors the reasoning process of the original argument.
## General Advice:
* **Understand the different types of logical reasoning:** Familiarize yourself with common logical structures like modus ponens, modus tollens, and hypothetical syllogism.
* **Practice identifying logical structures:** Analyze various arguments to hone your ability to recognize the underlying reasoning patterns.
* **Focus on the core logic, not just surface features:** Don't be misled by superficial similarities in objects or properties; prioritize the underlying logical structure.
* **Double-check your reasoning:** Carefully review your analysis and ensure your chosen answer aligns with the original argument's logic.
