## Explanation:
My initial analysis was correct in identifying the inconsistencies in the professors' statements. However, I made a crucial error in interpreting the information. I concluded that Professor Zhao's statement was wrong based on the assumption that only one professor could be completely correct. This assumption was incorrect.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation of information
* Incorrect assumption
* Logical fallacy
## Solution:
1. **Identify inconsistencies:** As before, we identify the inconsistencies in the professors' statements:
    * Professor Zhao: Champion is not Tsinghua or Zhejiang.
    * Professor Qian: Champion is not Tsinghua, but USTC.
    * Professor Sun: Champion is not USTC, but Tsinghua.
2. **Analyze possibilities:** We consider the possible scenarios based on the inconsistencies:
    * If Professor Zhao is correct, then the champion is either USTC or BUAA.
    * If Professor Qian is correct, then the champion is USTC.
    * If Professor Sun is correct, then the champion is Tsinghua.
3. **Identify the correct statement:** We recognize that only one professor can be completely correct, and the other two must have one correct and one incorrect statement.
4. **Deduce the champion:** Since Professor Sun's statement about USTC being the champion is contradicted by Professor Qian, it must be incorrect. Therefore, Professor Sun's statement about Tsinghua being the champion is correct.
## Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze each statement and identify inconsistencies.
2. Consider all possible scenarios based on the inconsistencies.
3. Remember that only one professor can be completely correct, and the others will have one correct and one incorrect statement.
4. Use the contradictions between the statements to identify the correct statement and deduce the answer.
## General Advice:
* Be cautious of making assumptions, especially when dealing with limited information.
* Consider all possibilities and systematically eliminate incorrect options.
* Pay close attention to logical relationships and contradictions between statements.
* Double-check your reasoning and conclusions before making a final decision.
