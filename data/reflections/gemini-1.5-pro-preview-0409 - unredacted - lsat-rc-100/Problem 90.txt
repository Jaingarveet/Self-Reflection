## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I misinterpreted the question's intent. I focused on identifying excerpts that expressed an opinion about the novel's style or structure, overlooking the broader context of the author's attitude towards the novel and its connection to African American artistic achievement.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Reading comprehension error
*   Focus on specifics over the broader context
## Solving the Problem
1.  **Reread the question:**  Focus on understanding the author's overall attitude towards the novel, not just specific stylistic elements.
2.  **Analyze each excerpt:** Evaluate how each excerpt contributes to the author's overall perspective on the novel's significance and connection to African American art.
3.  **Identify the outlier:** Look for the excerpt that does not express a positive or appreciative attitude towards the novel or its cultural context.
**Solution:**
Option A, while acknowledging the significance of African American music, does not directly express the author's attitude towards the novel *Jazz* itself. The other options highlight the novel's innovative structure, connection to music, and Morrison's skillful writing, all reflecting a positive evaluation.
