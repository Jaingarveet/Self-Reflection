## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the contrasting conclusions of the passages regarding the reliability of fingerprint evidence, interpreting Passage B's skepticism as tentativeness. However, the key difference lies in the scope of their arguments.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation 
*   Focus on conclusion
*   Ignoring scope 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze Passage A:** This passage focuses specifically on the legal history and acceptance of fingerprint evidence in court, emphasizing its long-standing use and expert consensus on reliability.
2.  **Analyze Passage B:** This passage broadly critiques the methodology of fingerprint analysis, questioning the lack of objective standards and quantifiable error rates across different approaches.
3.  **Compare Scope:** Passage A narrows in on the legal application of fingerprint evidence, while Passage B addresses the broader scientific and methodological concerns surrounding fingerprint analysis itself.
## Instructions for Future Questions
1.  **Identify the main focus of each passage:** Look for keywords and central arguments to understand the scope of each passage.
2.  **Compare the breadth of arguments:** Determine whether the passages address specific applications or broader theoretical issues.
