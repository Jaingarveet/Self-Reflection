## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My focus on the unique aspects of *Jazz*'s narrative structure and its connection to jazz music led me to overlook the broader context of African American literature. While the passage highlights the innovative nature of Morrison's approach, it also mentions that many African American writers have used music as a theme and metaphor. This suggests a broader trend within the literary tradition, making option E the most relevant question.
