## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I focused on the connection between railroads and the Pin Factory concept (increasing returns to scale) but failed to grasp the larger context of the passage, which critiques the limitations of the Invisible Hand theory in the face of increasing returns.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Misinterpretation of context
*   Failure to identify the author's argument
*   Overemphasis on a single detail
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Identify the role of railroads in the passage:** The passage mentions railroads as an example of an industry with increasing returns to scale, similar to the pin factory.
2.  **Connect this to the larger argument:** The author argues that the Invisible Hand theory, which relies on diminishing returns and competition, fails to account for industries with increasing returns, where monopolies tend to form.
3.  **Analyze the answer choices:** 
    *   A and B are irrelevant as they don't address the role of railroads.
    *   C is partially correct but doesn't capture the critical perspective on the Invisible Hand.
    *   **D correctly identifies that railroads exemplify the shortcomings of the Invisible Hand theory in industries with increasing returns.**
    *   E contradicts the passage's point about monopolies forming in such industries.
