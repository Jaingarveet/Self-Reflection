Solution:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.
2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:
   x(4x + 1) = 150
4. Expanding the equation:
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Solving this quadratic equation:
   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0
   So, x = 15/4 or -10
   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m
6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length) + 2(breadth)
   = 2(16) + 2(3.75) 
   = 32 + 7.5
   = 39.5 m
8. Rounding 39.5 m to the nearest whole number gives 40 m.
The correct answer is 40 m, which corresponds to option [REDACTED].
