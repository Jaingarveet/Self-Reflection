Solution:
1. Find the speed of the space shuttle:
   * In 40 seconds, it travels 700m high.
   * Speed = Distance / Time
   * Speed = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s
2. Now, we know that at this speed, it takes 5 seconds for the shuttle to pass a point.
   * This means that in 5 seconds, the shuttle will travel a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the point.
   * Let's assume the point has negligible length compared to the shuttle.
3. Calculate the distance traveled in 5 seconds:
   * Distance = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 17.5 m/s × 5s = 87.5 m
4. This distance is the sum of the length of the shuttle and the point.
   * Since we assume the point has negligible length, the length of the shuttle is approximately equal to this distance.
5. Rounding 87.5 m to the nearest answer choice:
   * The closest answer choice is [REDACTED].
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is approximately [REDACTED]eters.
