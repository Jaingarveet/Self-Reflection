Solution:
1) The question is about 5 consecutive odd numbers. Let's represent these numbers as: 
   (n-4), (n-2), n, (n+2), (n+4), where n is an odd number.
2) The sum of these numbers is:
   (n-4) + (n-2) + n + (n+2) + (n+4) = 5n
3) We are told that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. 
   In other words, 5n/10 = n/2 is a perfect square.
4) For n/2 to be a perfect square, n must be an even number. But we know that n is an odd number (given in the question). 
   The only way for an odd number divided by 2 to be a perfect square is if the odd number itself is a perfect square.
5) So, n must be an odd perfect square. The odd perfect squares are: 1, 9, 25, [REDACTED], 49, 81, 121, ...
6) Among the given options, [REDACTED] is an odd perfect square.
Therefore, [REDACTED] can be one of the 5 consecutive odd numbers.
