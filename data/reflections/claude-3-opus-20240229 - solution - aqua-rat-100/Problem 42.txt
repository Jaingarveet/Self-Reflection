Solution:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. 
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) If there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces.
5) The total width of all pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.
6) The total width of all spaces is (x-1) * 6 = 6x - 6 inches.
7) The total width of the fence in inches is x/2 + 6x - 6 = [REDACTED] - 6 inches.
8) To convert inches to feet, divide by 12.
9) The length of the fence in feet is ([REDACTED] - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet.
