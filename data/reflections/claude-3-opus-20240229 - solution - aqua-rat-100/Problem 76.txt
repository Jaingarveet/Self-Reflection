Solution:
Let's recalculate the upper bound for x when n=72:
x = (72^2 + 2*72*√72 + 8*72 + 16) / (72 + 4*√72 + 4)
  = (5184 + 1224 + 576 + 16) / (72 + 33.9 + 4)
  = 7000 / 109.9
  = 63.69
So the correct range for x when 36 ≤ n ≤ 72 is:
31.75 < x < 63.69
Looking at the choices again, the only one that fits this range is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
