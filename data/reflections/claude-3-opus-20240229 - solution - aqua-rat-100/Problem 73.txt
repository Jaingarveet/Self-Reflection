Solution:
Let the total number of students be x.
Number of students who took physics = 20% of x = 0.2x (must be a whole number)
Number of students who took math = 28% of x = 0.28x (must be a whole number)
For 0.2x and 0.28x to be whole numbers, x must be a multiple of 25.
The least multiple of 25 greater than 501 is 525. However, 20% of 525 is 105 and 28% of 525 is 147. The sum 105 + 147 = 252, which is 48% of 525. This implies that 52% of students took neither physics nor math, which is not possible.
In fact, for any number of students, the sum of the percentages of physics and math students cannot exceed 100%. Therefore, there is no possible number of students that satisfies the given conditions.
