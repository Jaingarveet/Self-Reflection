Solution:
Let the total number of matches played by Sachin be x.
His current batting average is 51, which means the total runs scored divided by the number of matches is 51.
* Total runs = 51 * x
In the finals, he scores 7[REDACTED] runs. So, the new total runs will be:
* New total runs = 51 * x + 7[REDACTED]
His new batting average is 54, which means the new total runs divided by the total matches (x) is 54.
* 54 = (51 * x + 7[REDACTED]) / x
Solve the equation:
* 54x = 51x + 7[REDACTED]
* 3x = 7[REDACTED]
* x = 2[REDACTED]
Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 2[REDACTED].
However, 2[REDACTED] is not one of the given choices. Let's check each choice:
A) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
B) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
C) [REDACTED]: 54 = (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED] (correct)
D) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
E) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
Therefore, the correct answer is C) [REDACTED].
