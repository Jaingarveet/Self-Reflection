Solution:
1) Let the height of the tower be h and the uniform speed of the car be v. 
   Also, let the distance of the car from the base of the tower at the start be x.
2) At the start, tan(45°) = h/x. Therefore, x = h.
3) After 10 minutes, tan(60°) = h/(x - 10v). 
   Therefore, √3 = h/(x - 10v).
4) Substituting x = h from step 2, we get:
   √3 = h/(h - 10v)
   √3(h - 10v) = h
   √3h - 10√3v = h
   √3h - h = 10√3v
   (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
5) Now, let's find the additional time taken. If the remaining distance is y, then:
   y = (√3 - 1)h = 10√3v
   Therefore, the additional time = y/v = 10√3(√3 - 1) minutes
6) Simplifying correctly, 10√3(√3 - 1) = 10(3 - √3) = 10(3/√3 - √3/√3) = 10(√3 - 1) = [REDACTED]
Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in [REDACTED] more minutes.
