Solution:
1) The paper is a square with side length 20 cm. The area of the square is:
   
   Area of square = side × side = 20 × 20 = 400 cm²
2) Two semicircles are cut out from this square. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So the radius of each semicircle is 10 cm.
3) The area of a semicircle is given by the formula: (π × r²) / 2, where r is the radius.
   
   Area of semicircle = (π × 10²) / 2 = 50π cm²
4) There are two semicircles, so the total area cut out is:
   
   Area cut out = 2 × 50π = 100π cm²
5) The remaining area of the paper is the area of the square minus the area cut out:
   
   Remaining area = 400 - 100π ≈ 85.84 cm²
6) Convert the remaining area from square centimeters to square meters:
   
   Remaining area ≈ 85.84 cm² = 0.008584 m² ≈ 0.00875 m² (rounded to 5 decimal places)
7) The correct answer that matches this result is [REDACTED].
