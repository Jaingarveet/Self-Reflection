Solution:
Given:
- The team won 20 matches.
- The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.
To find the number of matches lost, calculate [REDACTED]% of the number of matches won.
Number of matches lost = [REDACTED]% of 20
                        = 0.[REDACTED] Ã— 20
                        = 6
Therefore, the team lost 6 matches.
The closest answer choice is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
