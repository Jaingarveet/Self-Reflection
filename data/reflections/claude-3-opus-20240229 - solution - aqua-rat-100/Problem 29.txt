Solution:
1. The well is 30m deep, and the frog starts at the bottom (depth = 30m).
2. Each day, the frog jumps up 3m and then falls back down 2m.
3. Effectively, the frog gains 1m per day (3m - 2m = 1m).
4. After [REDACTED], the frog will have climbed 27m ([REDACTED] * 1m/day = 27m).
5. On the 28th day, the frog will jump up 3m, reaching a height of 30m (27m + 3m = 30m).
6. The frog will now be at the top of the well, ready to escape. It will not fall back down 2m on this last day.
Therefore, it will take the frog [REDACTED] to come out of the well.
