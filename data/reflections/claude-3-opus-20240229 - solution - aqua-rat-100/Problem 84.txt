Solution:
[REDACTED]) As before, let's consider the condition that Susan must be to the left of Tim. This fixes the relative positions of Susan and Tim.
[REDACTED]) There are two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim:
   - Susan, Tim
   - Tim, Susan
[REDACTED]) For each of these arrangements, Zen can be placed in any of the three positions: left, middle, or right.
4) So, for each arrangement of Susan and Tim, there are three possible positions for Zen.
5) Since there are two possible arrangements for Susan and Tim, and three possible positions for Zen in each arrangement, there are a total of [REDACTED] * [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] ways to arrange the children.
[REDACTED]) However, the question specifies that Susan must be to the left of Tim. This eliminates the arrangements where Tim is to the left of Susan.
[REDACTED]) So, we are left with the following three arrangements:
   - Susan, Zen, Tim
   - Susan, Tim, Zen
   - Zen, Susan, Tim
8) Therefore, there are [REDACTED] ways to arrange the children while keeping Susan to the left of Tim.
