Solution:
1. The company produces 420 units per month.
2. The production cost per unit is $110.
3. They want a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
To find the minimum selling price, we need to:
1. Calculate the yearly production
   - Yearly production = 420 units/month * 12 months = 5,040 units
2. Calculate the yearly production cost
   - Yearly production cost = 5,040 units * $110/unit = $554,400
3. Add the desired profit to the yearly production cost to get the total revenue needed
   - Total revenue needed = Yearly production cost + Desired profit
   - Total revenue needed = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800
4. Divide the total revenue needed by the yearly production to get the minimum selling price per unit
   - Minimum selling price per unit = Total revenue needed / Yearly production
   - Minimum selling price per unit = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units = $234.2857... per unit
   - Rounding up, the minimum selling price per unit is $235
The correct answer choice is [REDACTED]: $[REDACTED], as this is the minimum selling price from the given options that is greater than or equal to the calculated $234.29 per unit.
