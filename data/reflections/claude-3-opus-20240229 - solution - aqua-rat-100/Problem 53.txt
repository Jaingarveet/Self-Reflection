Solution:
Let's solve this problem again, step-by-step:
1. Let's assume Arjun has 'x' dollars and Sajal has 'y' dollars.
2. According to the first condition:
   If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   Mathematically, y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
   Simplifying, y + 30 = 2x - 60
   y = 2x - 90 ... (Equation 1)
3. According to the second condition:
   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   Mathematically, x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
   Simplifying, x + 10 = 3y - 30
   x = 3y - 40 ... (Equation 2)
4. Substitute the value of y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   x = 3(2x - 90) - 40
   x = 6x - 270 - 40
   x = 6x - 310
   5x = 310
   x = 62
5. Now, substitute x = 62 into Equation 1:
   y = 2(62) - 90
   y = 124 - 90
   y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
