Solution:
Let's approach this problem systematically:
1) If we use only single letters, we would need [REDACTED] letters to uniquely code each type of book.
2) If we use pairs of letters, where the order doesn't matter, then we are dealing with combinations, not permutations.
[REDACTED]) With [REDACTED] letters [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], we can create the following combinations:
   A[REDACTED], A[REDACTED], A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], CD
   This gives us 6 combinations ([REDACTED]C2 = 6), plus the [REDACTED] single letters, for a total of [REDACTED] codes.
[REDACTED]) Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed to create [REDACTED] unique codes, using either single letters or unordered pairs, is [REDACTED].
