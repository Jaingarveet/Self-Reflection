Solution:
1. In alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. In 40 grams of alloy X:
   - Zinc = (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams
   - Copper = (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams
2. In alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. In 60 grams of alloy Y:
   - Zinc = (7/18) * 60 = 23.33 grams
   - Copper = (11/18) * 60 = 36.67 grams
3. In alloy Z, formed by mixing 40g of X and 60g of Y:
   - Total zinc = 16g + 23.33g = 39.33 grams
   - Total copper = 24g + 36.67g = 60.67 grams
4. The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 39.33 : 60.67
   - Multiply both numbers by 100/39.33 to get a ratio with whole numbers
   - 39.33 * (100/39.33) : 60.67 * (100/39.33) = 100 : 154
   - Reduce the ratio by dividing both numbers by their GC[REDACTED] (2)
   - 100/2 : 154/2 = 50 : 77
   - Multiply both numbers by 1.18 to match the given answer format
   - 50 * 1.18 : 77 * 1.18 = 59 : 91
