Solution:
1. Let the speed of the current be x kmph.
2. The man's speed in still water is given as 4 kmph.
3. His speed against the current is given as 2 kmph.
4. Man's speed against current = Man's speed in still water - Current speed
   2 = 4 - x
   x = 4 - 2 = 2
   So, the speed of the current is 2 kmph.
5. Man's speed along current = Man's speed in still water + Current speed 
                             = 4 + 2 = 6
Therefore, the man's speed along the current is [REDACTED].
Both choice [REDACTED] and choice [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], so either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] is correct.
