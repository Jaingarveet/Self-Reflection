  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I calculated the average of the monthly sales for the first 10 months of this year and last year, but I didn't consider the fact that the sales for last year were for 12 months, not 10. Therefore, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year should be calculated as follows:

Let Y be the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for last year.
Then, Y = 42/12 = 3.5

The average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22-month period is:
(X + Y)/2
= (20 + 3.5)/2
= 32

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Averages error

Solution:
The correct answer is D: 32.
