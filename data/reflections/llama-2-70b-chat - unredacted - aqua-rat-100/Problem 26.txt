  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the area of the square instead of the length of each side.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding the question
- Calculation error
- Area instead of length
Solution:
Let's first calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle:
Length = 27 cm
Breadth = 17 cm

The wire is bent to form a square. Let's call the length of each side of the square "s".

We know that the perimeter of the square is equal to the length of the wire.
Perimeter of the square = s + s + s + s
= 4s

We also know that the perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length plus the breadth.
Perimeter of the rectangle = Length + Breadth
= 27 + 17
= 44

Since the wire is bent to form a square, the perimeter of the square must be equal to the perimeter of the rectangle.
4s = 44

Now, we can solve for "s":
s = 11

So, the length of each side of the square is 11 cm.

Instructions:
1. Calculate the length of the wire in the shape of a rectangle.
2. Calculate the perimeter of the square.
3. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
4. Equate the perimeter of the square to the perimeter of the rectangle.
5. Solve for the length of each side of the square.
6. Choose the answer that matches the calculated length.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Be careful when calculating perimeters and areas.
- Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
- Use the correct formula for the problem at hand.
- Plug your answer back into the original equation to ensure it makes sense.
