  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
The price of the product is reduced by 30%, which means the new price is 70% of the original price.
To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100% again, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price

= ($100 - $70) / $70
= $30 / $70
= 42.86%

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 42.86%.

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution:
Let's say the original price of the product was $100.
If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price would be $100 - (30% of $100) = $100 - $30 = $70.

To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100% again, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price

= ($100 - $70) / $70
= $30 / $70
= 42.86%

Instructions:
1. Identify the original price of the product.
2. Calculate the new price after a 30% reduction.
3. Calculate the percentage increase needed to make it 100% again using the formula.
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated percentage increase.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the formula for percentage increase is (New price - Old price) / Old price.
