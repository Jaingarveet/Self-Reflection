  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of permutation.
I thought that the number of ways to choose 2 oranges was equal to the number of ways to choose the first orange multiplied by the number of ways to choose the second orange.
However, this approach only works when the order of the oranges matters.
In this case, the order of the oranges does not matter, and we are counting the number of ways to choose 2 oranges without regard to order.
Therefore, the correct answer is 45, which is the number of ways to choose 2 oranges without regard to order.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of permutation
* Failure to recognize the concept of combinations
* Incorrect application of the multiplication principle

Solution:
There are 10 oranges in the basket, and we want to choose 2 oranges.
We can choose the first orange in 10 ways, and the second orange in 10 ways (since the order of the oranges does not matter).
By the combination formula, the total number of ways to choose 2 oranges is C(10, 2) = 45.

Instructions:

1. Identify the total number of items (10 oranges).
2. Identify the number of items to be chosen (2 oranges).
3. Recognize that the order of the items does not matter.
4. Apply the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)
5. Plug in the values: C(10, 2) = 10! / (2! \* (10-2)!)
6. Simplify the expression: C(10, 2) = 45
7. Choose the answer that matches the calculated result: Answer("A")

Advice:

* Always understand the concept of permutation and combination.
* Recognize when the order of items matters and when it does not.
* Apply the correct formula to solve the problem.
* Simplify the expression to obtain the final answer.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
