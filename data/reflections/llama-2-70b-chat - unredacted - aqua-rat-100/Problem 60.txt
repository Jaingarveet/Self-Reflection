  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that B bisects minor arc AC, but I incorrectly concluded that the measure of minor arc AD is 80°.

Error Keywords:

* Reasoning error
* Misapplication of concept
* Incorrect conclusion

Solution:
Points A, B, C, D lie in this order on the circumference of a circle. Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc BD is half of 160°, which is 80°. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 160° - 80° = 130°.

Instructions:

1. Identify the fact that B bisects minor arc AC.
2. Recognize that the measure of minor arc BD is half of 160°.
3. Calculate the measure of minor arc AD by subtracting the measure of minor arc BD from 160°.
4. Choose the answer that matches the calculated measure of minor arc AD.

Advice:

* Always carefully analyze the given information and identify the relevant facts.
* Apply the concepts and formulas appropriately.
* Double-check your calculations and conclusions.
* Consider all the given choices and eliminate any obviously incorrect options.
* Practice similar problems to improve your problem-solving skills.
