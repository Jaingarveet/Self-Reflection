  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the diameter of the sphere.
I correctly found the volume of the rectangular solid and set up the equation to solve for the radius of the sphere.
However, I incorrectly solved for the radius, which led to an incorrect calculation of the diameter.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Radius error
- Diameter error

Solution:
Let's first determine the volume of the rectangular solid.
Volume = Length × Width × Height
Volume = 3 × 4 × 15
Volume = 60

Since the solid is inscribed in a sphere, the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the solid.

We can use the formula for the volume of a sphere:
V = (4/3)πr³

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Now, we can set up the equation:
(4/3)πr³ = 60

We can solve for r:
r³ = (60/(4/3)) = 3^3 = 27
r = 3

Now, we can find the diameter of the sphere:
diameter = 2r = 2(3) = 6

So, the diameter of the sphere is 6.

Instructions:
1. Determine the volume of the rectangular solid.
2. Set up the equation to solve for the radius of the sphere.
3. Solve for the radius of the sphere.
4. Find the diameter of the sphere.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the diameter of a sphere is twice the radius.
