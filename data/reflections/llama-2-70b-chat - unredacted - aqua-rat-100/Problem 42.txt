  Explanation:
The correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.

The reasoning for this answer is as follows:

1. The total width of all the pickets is x/2.
2. The total width with spaces is x/2 + 6.
3. The length of the fence is the total width times the number of pickets, which is x/2 + 6 \* 13 = 13x/2 + 78.
4. To find the length of the fence in feet, we need to convert the result from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide the result by 12: 13x/2 + 78 / 12 = (13x-12)/24.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: (13x-12)/24.

Error Keywords:

* None of the above

Solution:

1. Calculate the total width of all the pickets: x/2.
2. Calculate the total width with spaces: x/2 + 6.
3. Calculate the length of the fence: x/2 + 6 \* 13 = 13x/2 + 78.
4. Convert the result from inches to feet: (13x-12)/24.

Instructions:

1. Identify the total width of all the pickets.
2. Calculate the total width with spaces.
3. Calculate the length of the fence.
4. Convert the result from inches to feet.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the length of a fence is calculated by multiplying the total width by the number of pickets.
* Remember that there are 12 inches in a foot, so to convert inches to feet, divide by 12.
