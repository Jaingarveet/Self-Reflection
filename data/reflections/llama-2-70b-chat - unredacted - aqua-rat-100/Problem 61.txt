  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by Kevin.
I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled as 420 miles, when in fact it was 180 miles.
This mistake was due to a misapplication of the formula:

Distance = Time x Speed

I applied this formula incorrectly, using the speed of 70 mph for both the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to A.
However, the correct speed for the distance traveled back to A should have been 90 mph.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Formula misapplication
 - Speed mistake
Solution:
Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
The time it took him to reach B is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = B - A / 70

The distance traveled to B is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = B - A / 70 x 70
Distance = B - A / 70 x 70

Since he turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to return to A is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = A - B / 90

The distance traveled back to A is:

Distance = Time x Speed
Distance = A - B / 90 x 90
Distance = A - B / 90 x 90

The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled to B and the distance traveled back to A:

Total distance = Distance to B + Distance back to A
Total distance = B - A / 70 x 70 + A - B / 90 x 90
Total distance = B - A / 70 x 70 + A - B / 90 x 90

Now, let's look at the choices:

A: 180 miles - Too small
B: 90 miles - Too small
C: 270 miles - Too small
D: 360 miles - Too large
E: None of the above - Incorrect, there is a valid answer

The correct answer is:

Action: Answer("180")

Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for distance traveled:
Distance = Time x Speed
2. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled to B:
Distance = B - A / 70 x 70
3. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled back to A:
Distance = A - B / 90 x 90
4. Calculate the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance to B + Distance back to A
5. Check your answer against the given choices.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the formula for distance traveled is:
Distance = Time x Speed
 - Be careful when applying formulas, ensure the correct variables are used.
