  Reflection:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the area of the remaining paper. I incorrectly calculated the area of the semi-circles and therefore arrived at the wrong answer.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Radius error
* Area error

Solution:
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The paper is a square with side length 20 cm.
2. Two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides of the square as diameters.
3. The radius of each semi-circle is half the side length of the square, which is 10 cm.
4. The area of each semi-circle is (1/2)πr^2, where r is the radius.
5. The total area of the two semi-circles is 2(1/2)π(10cm)^2 = 20π cm^2.
6. The area of the remaining paper is the area of the original square minus the total area of the two semi-circles.
7. The area of the original square is 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
8. Therefore, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 20π = 8.79 cm^2.

Instructions:

1. Identify the correct formula for the area of a semi-circle.
2. Use the formula to calculate the area of each semi-circle.
3. Calculate the total area of the two semi-circles.
4. Calculate the area of the remaining paper by subtracting the total area of the semi-circles from the area of the original square.
5. Simplify your answer to the nearest hundredth.

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Make sure you are using the correct formulas and plugging in the correct values.
* Take your time and work through each step carefully, especially when dealing with geometry and trigonometry problems.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help or seek additional resources if you're struggling with a concept or problem.
