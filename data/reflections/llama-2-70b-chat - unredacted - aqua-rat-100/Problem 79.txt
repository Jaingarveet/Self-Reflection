  Action: Answer("E")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the amount each daughter receives incorrectly. I apologize for my mistake.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the question
* Calculation error
* Incorrect answer

Solution:
Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees.
Since there are 2 nephews, the total amount they receive is 2x rupees.

Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x rupees.

There are 4 daughters, so the total amount they receive is 4x + 4x + 4x + 4x = 16x rupees.

Since there are 5 sons, each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x rupees.

The total amount the sons receive is 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x + 5x = 25x rupees.

The total amount available to divide is Rs 8600, so we can set up the following equation:

16x + 25x = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

41x = 8600

Dividing both sides by 41, we get:

x = 210

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(210) = 840 rupees.

The correct answer is:

E: Rs 800

Therefore, the answer is E.
