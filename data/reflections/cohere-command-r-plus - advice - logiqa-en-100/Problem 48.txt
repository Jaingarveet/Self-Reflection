Advice:
- Understand the structure of the argument and identify its assumptions. 
- Carefully read each choice and analyze how it relates to the argument. 
- Look for choices that introduce alternative explanations or challenge the argument's core assumptions. 
- Ensure that you correctly interpret the question, especially the distinction between supporting and countering an argument. 
- Avoid choices that strengthen the argument; focus on those that offer different perspectives or challenge its underlying logic.
