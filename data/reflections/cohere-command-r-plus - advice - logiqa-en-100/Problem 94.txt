Advice:
- Understand the argument's conclusion and premises.
- Focus on the key elements of the argument and identify potential flaws or gaps.
- Analyze each choice critically and independently, rather than solely in relation to the argument. 
- Recognize red herrings and irrelevant information that may distract from the main issue. 
- Identify choices that introduce new variables or shift the focus to different aspects. 
- Always choose the answer that presents the strongest challenge to the argument's conclusion, not just any challenge.
