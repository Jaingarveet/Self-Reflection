Advice:
- Understand the argument's structure and assumptions. 
- Recognize that weakening an argument is about undermining its assumptions or data/source reliability. 
- Evaluate each choice critically, focusing on their impact on the argument's core, not peripheral details. 
- Avoid red herrings that distract with irrelevant information. 
- Stay focused on the specific topic and scope of the argument.
