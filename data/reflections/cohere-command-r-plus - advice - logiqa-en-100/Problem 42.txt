Advice:
 - Focus on the argument's conclusion and key premises when evaluating the choices.
 - Recognize and avoid red herrings that distract from the central issue.
 - Ensure that your selected choice directly refutes the argument's conclusion, not a peripheral detail.
 - Consider alternative explanations that challenge the argument's interpretation of the evidence.
 - Stay objective and avoid making assumptions or filling in gaps with your own conclusions.
