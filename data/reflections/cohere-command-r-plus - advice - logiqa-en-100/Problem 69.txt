Advice:
 - Always identify the given information and the inference clearly.
 - Decompose complex logical statements into simple, explicit assumptions.
 - Analyze each assumption critically and independently. 
 - Understand the role of each assumption in supporting the inference. 
 - Avoid making assumptions that are implicit in the given information or inference. 
 - Recognize that irrelevant or contradictory statements cannot be correct assumptions. 
 - Always test your reasoning by verifying that the inference does not hold when the correct assumption is removed.
