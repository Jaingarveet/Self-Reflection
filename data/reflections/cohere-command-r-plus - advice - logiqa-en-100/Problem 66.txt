Advice:
- Consider all given conditions and fixed arrangements as a starting point.
- Look for flexibility or variability in the remaining elements.
- Explore all possible arrangements by varying the movable elements while keeping the fixed elements in place.
- Avoid making assumptions or limiting yourself to a single arrangement without exploring all possibilities.
- Always double-check your interpretations and the validity of each arrangement.
