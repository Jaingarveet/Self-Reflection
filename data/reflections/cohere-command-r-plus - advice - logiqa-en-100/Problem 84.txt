Advice:
- Focus on the logical structure and relationships between statements rather than specific words or examples.
- Identify the key elements of the argument: the universal statement ("All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED]"), the negative statement about an individual ("[REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]"), and the conclusion ("Therefore, [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]").
- Look for these elements in the answer choices, and select the one that mirrors this structure.
- Practice identifying logical structures to improve your ability to recognize them quickly and accurately.
