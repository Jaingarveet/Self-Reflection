Advice:
 - Read the context and question multiple times to ensure a thorough understanding.
 - Identify keywords and phrases that indicate necessary or sufficient conditions, such as "if," "only if," "necessary," or "sufficient."
 - Be cautious when interpreting phrases like "doing better" or "being the best." These often relate to necessary conditions for competition rather than guarantees of success.
 - Always consider the context and tone of the paragraph when evaluating answer choices.
 - Avoid making assumptions or interpreting the text beyond what is explicitly stated.
