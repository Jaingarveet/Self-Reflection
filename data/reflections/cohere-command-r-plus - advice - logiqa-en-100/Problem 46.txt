Advice:
- Always list the given conditions clearly before starting.
- Start with the simplest constraints first and build from there.
- Consider the implications of each condition step-by-step.
- Look for direct contradictions or incompatibilities when evaluating pairs or combinations.
- Double-check your reasoning against each condition to ensure you haven't overlooked anything.
