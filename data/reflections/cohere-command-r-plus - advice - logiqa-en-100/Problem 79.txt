Advice:
 - Always read and understand the argument and the question thoroughly.
 - Carefully interpret the specific requirements of the question, such as "doubt" or "rebuttal."
 - Consider all choices and evaluate them critically and independently.
 - Avoid narrow focus; consider the broader context and implications of the argument and choices.
 - Recognize that doubts or rebuttals should directly challenge or question the argument's core claims or evidence.
