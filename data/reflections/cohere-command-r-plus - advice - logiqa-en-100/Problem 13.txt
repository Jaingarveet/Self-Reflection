Advice:
 - Always read the context and question carefully, paying attention to keywords and phrases that indicate the main point or argument. 
 - Interpret any figurative language or implied meanings; don't take everything literally. 
 - Analyze each answer choice critically, evaluating how well it captures the essence of the context and addresses the question. 
 - Look for answers that address systemic issues rather than individual blame, especially when the context hints at structural failures or injustices. 
 - Remember that logic questions often require identifying underlying assumptions or implications, so don't be swayed by superficial similarities in answer choices.
