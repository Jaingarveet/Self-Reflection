Instructions:
1.  **Gather information:** Obtain the patient's history, physical examination findings, and any available imaging studies, including the chest X-ray.
2.  **Analyze the chest X-ray:** Look for specific features associated with each potential diagnosis, such as heart size, shape, and pulmonary vascular markings.
3.  **Correlate X-ray findings with clinical presentation:** Consider the patient's symptoms and signs, such as cyanosis, heart failure, and respiratory distress, in conjunction with the X-ray findings.
4.  **Consider additional tests:** If necessary, recommend further investigations such as echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.
5.  **Formulate a differential diagnosis:** List the possible diagnoses based on the available evidence, and prioritize them based on the likelihood.
6.  **Reach a final diagnosis:** Based on all the gathered information, make the most probable diagnosis.
