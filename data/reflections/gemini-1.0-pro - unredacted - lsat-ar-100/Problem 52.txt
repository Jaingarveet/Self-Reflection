## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial reasoning was flawed. While I correctly identified that Franco and Garcia could not testify on Wednesday due to Jackson and Iturbe's Wednesday testimonies, I mistakenly concluded that both Franco and Garcia must testify on Tuesday. This overlooked the possibility of one of them testifying on Monday, fulfilling the requirement of at least one witness on that day.
**Error Keywords:**
* Overlooking possibilities
* Jumping to conclusions
* Misinterpreting requirements
**Solution:**
1. **Identify restrictions:**
    * Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
    * Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
    * Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
    * At least one witness testifies on Monday.

    * Franco on Monday, Garcia on Tuesday.
    * Hong and Iturbe on Tuesday (fulfills requirement).
5. **Conclusion:**
    * Both scenarios satisfy the conditions.
    * The number of witnesses on Monday can be either one or two.
