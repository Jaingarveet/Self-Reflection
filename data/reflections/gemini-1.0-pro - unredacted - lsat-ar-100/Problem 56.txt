**Solution:**
1. **Analyze the given information:**
    * Seven sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
    * Three sales zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
    * Each representative works in exactly one zone.
    * Conditions:
        * Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
        * Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
        * Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
        * Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
        * More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
    * Question: If more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which of the following could be true?
2. **Deduce the possible scenarios:**
    * Since more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, there must be at least 3 representatives in Zone 1 and at most 2 representatives in Zone 3.
    * Based on the conditions, we can create a table of possible scenarios:
| Zone 1 | Zone 2 | Zone 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Parra, Tiao, X | Udall, Y | Kim, Mahr, Stuckey |
| Parra, Tiao, X | Y, Udall | Kim, Mahr, Stuckey |
| Parra, X, Y | Tiao, Udall | Kim, Mahr, Stuckey |
| X, Y, Z | Tiao, Udall | Kim, Mahr, Parra, Stuckey |
(Note: X, Y, and Z represent other representatives)
3. **Evaluate the answer choices:**
    * A: Kim works in Zone 2. This is possible in scenarios 1 and 2.
    * B: Mahr works in Zone 2. This is possible in scenarios 1 and 2.
    * C: Parra works in Zone 3. This is not possible in any scenario.
    * D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This is possible in scenarios 1, 2, and 3.
    * E: Udall works in Zone 3. This is possible in scenarios 1 and 2.
4. **Identify the correct answer:**
    * The only answer choice that is true in all possible scenarios where more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3 is **E: Udall works in Zone 3.**
