Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the information provided was sufficient to determine the exact number of plays each student reviewed. However, the information only establishes relative comparisons between the students' reviews.
Error Keywords:
- Incomplete information
- Relative comparison
- Assumption
Solution:
1. Identify the relative comparisons provided:
    - Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
    - Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
    - Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
    - Exactly two students review the same plays.
2. Analyze the choices based on the relative comparisons:
    - A: Jiang reviews more plays than Lopez does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    - B: Megregian reviews more plays than Jiang does. This MUST be true. Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review at least one more play than Jiang.
    - C: Megregian reviews more plays than O'Neill does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    - D: O'Neill reviews more plays than Jiang does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
    - E: O'Neill reviews more plays than Kramer does. This could be true, but we don't have enough information to confirm it.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the problem statement and all provided information.
2. Identify the relative comparisons and absolute values explicitly stated in the problem.
3. Analyze the choices based on the identified information, considering both relative comparisons and absolute values.
4. Choose the answer that is definitively true based on the available information, even if other possibilities exist.
Advice:
- Be cautious of making assumptions based on incomplete information.
- Focus on identifying the relative comparisons and absolute values explicitly stated in the problem.
- Analyze the choices systematically, considering all possibilities allowed by the available information.
- Choose the answer that is definitively true, even if other possibilities remain.
