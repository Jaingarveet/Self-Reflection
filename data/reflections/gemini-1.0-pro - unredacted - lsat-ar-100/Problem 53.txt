## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I misinterpreted the rules regarding the showing times for houses L, M, and N. I mistakenly assumed that L could only be shown in the afternoon, which led me to the wrong conclusion about the overall schedule.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation of rules
* Incorrect assumption
* Logical reasoning error
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the key rules:**
    * J must be shown in the evening.
    * K cannot be shown in the morning.
    * L must be shown after K and before M.
2. **Analyze the possible scenarios:**
    * **Morning:** Since K cannot be shown in the morning, L and M are the only options. However, L cannot be shown before K, so this scenario is not possible.
    * **Afternoon:** K can be shown in the afternoon, followed by L and then M. This satisfies all the rules.
    * **Evening:** J must be shown in the evening, leaving only P as the remaining option.
3. **Draw conclusions:**
    * Based on the analysis, the only possible scenario is K in the afternoon, followed by L and M.
    * Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.
**Instructions for Future Reference:**
1. Carefully read and understand all the rules and constraints.
2. Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.
3. Consider all possible scenarios and analyze them systematically.
4. Avoid making assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
5. Double-check your reasoning and conclusions before selecting an answer.
**General Advice for Similar Problems:**
* Pay close attention to the wording of the rules and identify any hidden implications.
* Use diagrams or tables to visualize the relationships between different elements.
* Test different scenarios to see if they satisfy all the given conditions.
* Be cautious about making assumptions and clearly justify your reasoning.
* If unsure, re-read the problem and consider alternative interpretations.
