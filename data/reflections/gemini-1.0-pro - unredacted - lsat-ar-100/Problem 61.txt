## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
I incorrectly identified statement E as impossible. My reasoning was flawed because I overlooked the possibility that Ong could be assigned to Yemen, thus satisfying the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
## Error Keywords
* **Oversight:** I failed to consider all possible scenarios.
* **Logical Fallacy:** I made a hasty generalization by assuming that Ong's exclusion from Venezuela automatically meant his exclusion from all ambassadorships.
* **Constraint Violation:** I misinterpreted the constraint, focusing solely on Venezuela instead of considering all possible assignments.
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify the constraints:**
    * Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
    * If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
    * If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
    * Landon, if assigned, goes to Zambia.
2. **Analyze each statement:**
    * A: Jaramillo to Zambia - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * B: Kayne to Zambia - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * C: Novetzke to Zambia - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * D: Landon not assigned - Possible (doesn't violate any constraint).
    * E: Ong not assigned - **Impossible** (violates the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke must be assigned).
3. **Identify the correct answer:** C: Novetzke to Zambia.
## Instructions for Future Problems
1. **Read and understand all constraints carefully.**
2. **Consider all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions.**
3. **Avoid making assumptions or generalizations.**
4. **Double-check your reasoning and ensure it aligns with all constraints.**
5. **Systematically analyze each statement and identify any violations.**
