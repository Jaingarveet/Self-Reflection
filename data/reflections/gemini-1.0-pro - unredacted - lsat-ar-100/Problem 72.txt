Explanation:
I incorrectly placed the pharmacy next to the optometrist and shoe store, violating the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
Error Keywords:
- Constraint violation
- Misplacement
- Logic error
Solution:
1. Pharmacy must be at one end (let's say the left end).
2. Optometrist and shoe store are together.
3. Restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.
4. Toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
5. Place the veterinarian next to the pharmacy (left end).
6. Place the toy store next to the veterinarian.
7. Place a restaurant next to the toy store.
8. Place the other restaurant at the other end (right end).
Instructions:
1. Read and understand all constraints.
2. Start with the most constrained element (pharmacy) and place it first.
3. Place elements with the most restrictions next.
4. Consider the separation requirements between elements.
5. Work step-by-step, placing elements and checking constraints.
6. Double-check placement against all constraints before finalizing.
Advice:
- Pay close attention to all constraints and their implications.
- Start with the most constrained elements and work outwards.
- Visualize the placement of elements to avoid logical errors.
- Double-check your work against all constraints before finalizing.
- Consider using diagrams or tables to visualize the arrangement.
