Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: you are walking down steps while the elevator is moving.
2. Identify the number of steps you walk and the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom in each scenario.
3. Realize that the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom is the time it takes for the elevator to cover the remaining steps after you stop walking.
4. Understand that since this time does not change between scenarios, the speed of the elevator is constant.
5. Calculate the speed of the elevator by dividing the number of steps you walk by the time it takes for the elevator to reach the bottom.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated speed.
