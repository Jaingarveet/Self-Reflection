Instructions:
1. Denote the breadth as x and the length as 4x + 1.
2. Set up the equation for the area of the rectangle: x * (4x + 1) = 150.
3. Solve this equation to find the values of x and 4x + 1.
4. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula 2 * (length + breadth).
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
