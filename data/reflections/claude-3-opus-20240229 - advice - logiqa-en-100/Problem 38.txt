Advice:
 - Always consider both direct and indirect ecological interactions between species.
 - Competition for shared resources can be just as impactful as direct predation.
 - An increase in one species can lead to a decrease in another species if they compete for the same limited resources.
 - Don't just look for answer choices that introduce completely new factors; consider how the given information about the species in question could relate to the argument.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the argument or that don't significantly affect its validity.
 - Read the question carefully to determine if you are looking for an answer choice that strengthens or weakens the argument.
