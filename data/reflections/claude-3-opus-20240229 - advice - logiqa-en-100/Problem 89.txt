Advice:
 - Always fully analyze each constraint and its implications.
 - Look for necessary conclusions that must follow from the constraints.
 - Eliminate scenarios that are impossible based on the constraints.
 - Be careful not to overlook any implications of the constraints.
 - If a statement is true in all possible scenarios, it must be a necessary conclusion.
 - Don't stop your analysis prematurely; make sure to fully consider all possibilities.
