Advice:
 - In combinatorial logic problems, consider all the constraints and their implications.
 - Look for key pieces of information that can significantly limit the possible combinations.
 - Systematically test each possibility, eliminating those that don't fit the constraints.
 - Be careful not to make assumptions; rely only on the given information and the logical implications of that information.
