Advice:
 - Focus on identifying the underlying assumptions, not just the explicit statements.
 - [REDACTED] hypothesis or assumption is a statement that must be true for the argument's conclusion to logically follow.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or tangential to the core argument.
 - Be careful not to introduce additional assumptions or ideas that aren't present in the original argument.
 - In logical reasoning questions, the correct answer often hinges on subtle implications rather than obvious statements.
