Advice:
 - Don't just look for the most obvious or literal explanation. Consider indirect explanations that address underlying motivations.
 - Think through the implications of each answer choice. What does it reveal about how people think about the issue?
 - Look for the answer that best bridges the gap between people's stated beliefs and their actual choices.
 - Eliminate answers that don't address the contradiction or that provide irrelevant information.
 - Remember that people's reasoning is not always straightforward. Look for hidden factors that influence their opinions and decisions.
