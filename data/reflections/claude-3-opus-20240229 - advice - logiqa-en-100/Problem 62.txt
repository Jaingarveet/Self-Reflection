Advice:
 - Always make sure you are answering the specific question being asked. Don't get sidetracked by tangential details.
 - Consider each answer choice from multiple angles. The best choice may not be the most obvious one.
 - When evaluating an opinion, look for gaps in logic, unstated assumptions, and failure to consider alternative explanations. 
 - Just because a choice contradicts one specific detail of an argument doesn't necessarily mean it raises the most doubts about the overall opinion.
 - The choice that suggests the most compelling alternative explanation is often the one that raises the greatest doubts about the original opinion.
