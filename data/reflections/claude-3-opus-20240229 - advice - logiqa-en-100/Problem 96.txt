Advice:
- Always read the passage and question carefully to identify the main argument and what the question is asking.
- Consider how each answer choice relates to and impacts the main argument.
- Eliminate irrelevant choices to narrow down your options.
- Look for the choice that most directly and significantly supports or strengthens the argument.
- Remember that a choice that weakens the argument can sometimes strengthen it by contrast.
- Take your time and think through the logical connections between the argument and the answer choices.
