Advice:
 - Always read the full question and understand the key claim you are evaluating.
 - Always consider each answer choice carefully and look for direct evidence that contradicts the main assertion.
 - Never just pick an answer because it seems related to the topic or matches your first instinct.
 - Always be on the lookout for your own potential biases and try to set them aside.
 - Never ignore an answer choice just because it doesn't fit your initial assumptions.
