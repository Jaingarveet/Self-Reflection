Advice:
- Always fully consider the implications of known conditions.
- Use a systematic approach to reason through different cases.
- Don't just evaluate answer choices; reason through the problem logically.
- Connect the dots between implications; consider how each affects the others.
- If you get stuck, break the problem down into smaller parts.
- Double-check your reasoning, especially if arriving at a definite conclusion.
- If no definite answer emerges, don't guess; recognize the ambiguity.
