Advice:
 - In logic problems with multiple statements, consider each statement independently and its implications.
 - Clearly identify any constraints or conditions that must be satisfied.
 - Systematically consider all possibilities, eliminating those that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
 - Be rigorous in your reasoning and don't jump to conclusions prematurely.
 - If you get stuck, try working backwards from the constraints to see which possibilities they allow.
 - Practice breaking down complex problems into clear, step-by-step reasoning.
