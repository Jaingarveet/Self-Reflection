Advice:
 - Always read the question and conditions carefully and understand them fully before attempting to solve.
 - Break down complex conditions into simpler implications and facts.
 - Be very careful with conditional statements. Consider what must be true if the condition is true, and what must be true if the condition is false.
 - Systematically consider all possible cases. Don't jump to conclusions based on partial analysis.
 - Eliminate answer choices one by one based on deduced facts. The correct answer must be consistent with all given information.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices, seeing if you can rule any out.
