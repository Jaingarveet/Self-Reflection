Advice:
 - Always consider all given information, even if some seems irrelevant at first.
 - Be careful about the phrasing of the question - "must be" is different from "may be".
 - Check each potential solution methodically against all conditions.
 - Don't make unwarranted assumptions; only draw conclusions based on the given information.
 - In complex problems, break things down and reason step-by-step.
