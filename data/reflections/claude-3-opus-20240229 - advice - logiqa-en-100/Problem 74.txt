Advice:
 - Always consider the implications of each choice in light of all given conditions.
 - Be thorough in considering both the direct and indirect consequences of each selection.
 - Eliminate options systematically based on logical deductions from the conditions.
 - If a choice leads to a scenario that violates a condition, that choice cannot be part of the solution.
 - In complex scenarios, it may help to enumerate all possible valid selections to identify the impossible ones.
