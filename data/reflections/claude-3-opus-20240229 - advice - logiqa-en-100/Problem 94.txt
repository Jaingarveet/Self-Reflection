Advice:
 - Always read the conclusion carefully and make sure you understand exactly what is being claimed.
 - Stay focused on the specific conclusion being made; avoid getting sidetracked by tangential points.
 - Look for answer choices that directly challenge the key assumptions or claims of the conclusion.
 - The correct answer will often point out an alternative explanation or contradictory evidence that suggests the conclusion may be wrong.
 - Don't be distracted by choices that are only loosely related to the conclusion or that don't directly question it.
 - Take your time and reason through each choice carefully before making a selection.
