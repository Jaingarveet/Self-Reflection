Advice:
- Focus on direct logical contradiction rather than tangentially related facts.
- Make sure refutations are relevant to the specific claim and timeframe of the argument.
- Don't be distracted by extraneous details or overcomplicate the reasoning.
- Eliminate incorrect answers first to help identify the correct refutation.
- Always double check your selection against the stated argument.
