Advice:
 - Don't assume premises are absolute statements unless clearly specified. Watch for qualifying language.
 - Always consider if there are exception cases or unlikely scenarios where a conclusion may not hold, even if premises are true.
 - [REDACTED] conclusion that is highly likely or almost certainly true based on the premises may still have a small chance of being false.
 - Absolute statements like "cannot be true" or "cannot be false" are only correct if there are truly no possible exceptions.
 - Read carefully and consider all possibilities before selecting an answer.
