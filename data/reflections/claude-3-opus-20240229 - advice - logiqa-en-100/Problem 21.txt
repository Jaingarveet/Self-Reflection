Advice:
 - Always read questions carefully and make sure you understand exactly what is being asked before attempting to answer.
 - In logic questions about arguments, differentiate between the content of an argument and the method/structure of an argument.
 - When someone refutes an argument, identify if they are attacking the conclusion, the premises, or the overall logic and persuasiveness of the argument.
 - Eliminate answer choices that do not fit the refutation method used, even if they seem somewhat relevant to the argument's content.
 - If you find yourself focusing too much on the details of the arguments, take a step back and look at the big picture of how the arguments interact.
