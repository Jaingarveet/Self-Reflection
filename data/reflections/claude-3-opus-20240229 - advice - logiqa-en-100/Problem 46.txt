Advice:
 - In problems with multiple conditions, consider the implications of each condition carefully.
 - Look out for conditions that link the placement of multiple entities - these often have far-reaching implications.
 - Use the process of elimination to systematically rule out impossible scenarios.
 - Don't just consider each condition in isolation - think about how they interact with each other.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions - stick to the information given in the question.
 - Double-check your reasoning for each answer choice before selecting your final answer.
