Advice:
- Be open to metaphorical and figurative language when interpreting statements, especially in different cultural contexts.
- Don't get caught up in the literal meaning of words; look for the underlying message or idea.
- Consider proverbs and common sayings that may succinctly capture complex ideas.
- When faced with multiple options, evaluate each one based on how well it represents the main point, not just surface-level similarities.
- In logical reasoning questions, the correct answer may not always be the most obvious or literal choice.
