Advice:
- Always read questions thoroughly to ensure you understand what is being asked.
- Take time to carefully consider how each answer choice relates to the main argument.
- Don't just look for the "right" answer; also consider how the "wrong" answers fail to fit the question.
- Be careful not to let your own opinions bias your choice; stick closely to the logic of the argument and question at hand.
- If a choice seems to support the argument rather than challenge it, it's likely the odd one out for a question like this.
