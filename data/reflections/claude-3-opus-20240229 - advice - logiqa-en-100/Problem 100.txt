Advice:
 - Always read the question and context carefully to understand the problem and conditions.
 - Always consider all the relevant conditions when evaluating each choice.
 - Never assume additional constraints that are not explicitly stated in the conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning for each choice to avoid misinterpretations.
 - If a choice seems to violate a condition, re-read the condition carefully to confirm.
