Advice:
 - Always read the question and given information carefully to fully understand the problem.
 - Focus on the core message and identify the guiding principle or rule being expressed.
 - Consider each answer choice independently and systematically.
 - [REDACTED] choice can fail to be a logical inference by either being unrelated to the statement or by misinterpreting it.
 - Be careful not to choose an option just because it seems untrue; it must be illogical based on the given statement.
 - Eliminate choices methodically and double-check your final selection to avoid mistakes.
