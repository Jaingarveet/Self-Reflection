Solution:
The passage is primarily about Lady Carlotta's encounter with a struggling horse and her history of interfering on behalf of distressed animals. Lady Carlotta also misses her train and is mistaken for a governess by Mrs. Quabarl. Lady Carlotta accepts the job and is given instructions on how to teach the children. However, these details are secondary to the main idea of the passage. Therefore, the best summary of the passage is that a woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.
