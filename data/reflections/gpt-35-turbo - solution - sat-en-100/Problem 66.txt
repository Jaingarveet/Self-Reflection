Solution:
The table shows the percentage of all four types of nitrogenous bases in yeast DN[REDACTED], not just the purines. 
To find the percentage of purines, we need to add the percentage of adenine and guanine. 
The percentage of adenine in yeast DN[REDACTED] is 31.3\%, and the percentage of guanine is 18.7\%. 
Therefore, the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED].
