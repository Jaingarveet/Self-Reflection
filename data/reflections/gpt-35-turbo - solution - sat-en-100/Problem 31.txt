Solution:
The study used northern bald ibises to investigate how birds fly in a V formation. The ibises were part of an existing project to reintroduce them to Europe. The study required data loggers and GPS to track the birds' flight positions. The passage states that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
