Solution:
The main focus of the passage is on the narrator's love of reading and how it provides a safe haven from his troubled life. The passage then shifts to the narrator's favorite place, the Sempere & Sons bookshop, and how he received the best gift he ever received from Sempere, an old volume of "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens. The narrator becomes enchanted with the book and wants to learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.
