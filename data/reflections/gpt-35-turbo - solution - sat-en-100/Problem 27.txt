Solution:
The authors proposed that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine in DN[REDACTED]. 
The table shows the percentage of each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in the DN[REDACTED] of various organisms. 
For each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine. 
Therefore, the data in the table support the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DN[REDACTED].
