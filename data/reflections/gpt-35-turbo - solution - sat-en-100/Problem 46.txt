Solution:
Grimké argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be taken away from the slave, but they cannot be alienated. Therefore, the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities than to woman. Grimké's central claim is that the rights of individuals are not determined by race or gender.
