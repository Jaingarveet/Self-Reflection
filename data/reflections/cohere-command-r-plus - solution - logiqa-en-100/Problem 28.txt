Solution:
Given constraints:
- E or F will participate, but not both.
- J or K will participate, but not both.
- If J participates, then G participates.
- If F does not participate, M does not participate.

Let's start by considering the options for E and F:
- Case 1: E participates, F does not.
- Case 2: E does not participate, F does participates.

For Case 1:
Selecting E means we cannot choose F. Now, let's consider J and K. If we select J, then G must also be selected. So, the team so far could be {E, G, J} with one spot remaining. M is not an option because F is not selected. So, the fourth player must be H or K. Therefore, one possible team is {E, G, J, H}.

For Case 2:
Similarly, if we select F, we cannot choose E or M. Choosing J would lead to the team {F, G, J} with one spot left, which could be H or K. So, another possible team is {F, G, J, H}.

The only two possible teams that meet all the constraints are {E, G, J, H} and {F, G, J, H}, corresponding to choice [REDACTED].
