Solution:
Given that G is the northernmost island and F is adjacent to H, we can determine that G, F, and H must appear in that order from north to south. However, the relative positions of E and I can vary, leading to multiple possible arrangements:

1. G, F, H, E, I
[REDACTED]. G, F, E, H, I
[REDACTED]. G, F, H, I, E
[REDACTED]. G, E, F, H, I

Thus, there are four possible arrangements, matching choice [REDACTED].
