Solution:
Given: 
- [REDACTED] 6-story office building with 6 departments, each occupying one floor.
- The human resources and sales departments are not on adjacent floors, meaning there is exactly one floor between them.
- The finance department is on the floor immediately above or below the planning department.
- The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.

Deductions: 
1. The finance and planning departments must occupy two consecutive floors, but their order is not yet determined.
2. The administration department must be above the planning department and below human resources, which limits its placement to two possible floors.
3. The human resources and sales departments must be separated by exactly one floor, creating two possible pairs of floors for them.
4. The R&[REDACTED] department will occupy the remaining floor.

Evaluation: 
 [REDACTED]: Finance, Planning, Administration, Human Resources, R&[REDACTED], Sales - Correct!
 - This order satisfies all conditions. Human Resources and Sales are separated by the R&[REDACTED] department floor.
 - The administration department is above planning but below human resources.
 - Finance and planning are consecutive.
 [REDACTED]: Incorrect order. This arrangement places human resources and sales as neighbors, contradicting the given information.
 [REDACTED]: Incorrect order. This order separates finance and planning, which we know must be consecutive.
 [REDACTED]: Incorrect order. Similar to [REDACTED], this order also separates finance and planning.
