Solution:
The argument concludes that a newly built house in Hexi Village is not protected by law because it is a "small property house," and all small-property houses are not subject to registration and legal protection.

Choice [REDACTED] directly contradicts the classification of the house as a "small property house." However, this does not weaken the argument. Even if the house is not a "small property house," the argument's conclusion remains valid because it relies on the lack of legal protection for such houses.

Choice [REDACTED] introduces new information that some of the newly built houses in Hexi Village are not small property houses. This information weakens the argument because it suggests that the legal status of "small property houses" is not clear-cut. If some newly built houses in the same village are not considered "small property houses" and may be protected by law, then the conclusion that all such houses are automatically unprotected is questionable.
