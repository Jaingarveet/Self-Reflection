Solution:
Given:
- There are 4 men: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
- 3 are tall.
- 2 are doctors.
- 1 is handsome.
- [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are doctors.
- [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] have the same height.
- [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall (one is tall, the other is not).

Step-by-step solution:
1. From the first statement, we know there are 3 tall men out of the 4.
2. The second statement tells us that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are doctors, so we can infer that there are no other doctors among the four.
3. The third statement tells us that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] have the same height, so they are both tall or both short.
4. The fourth statement tells us that only one of [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] is tall. 
5. We can deduce that [REDACTED] must be tall because if he were short, then [REDACTED] would also have to be short, contradicting the fact that 3 out of 4 men are tall.
6. Now we know that [REDACTED] is tall and [REDACTED] is not.
7. This means that [REDACTED] must be the handsome one, as this is the only characteristic he can possess (he is not tall, and we know that [REDACTED] is already a doctor).
8. Therefore, [REDACTED] is the only person who meets all the requirements: he is a doctor (statement 2), tall (statement 1), and handsome (process of elimination).
