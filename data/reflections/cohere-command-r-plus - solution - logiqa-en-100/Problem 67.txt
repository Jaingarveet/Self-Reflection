Solution:
The argument states that the official history of China has been the diary of the emperor's family, known as "Zhengshi." 
However, it suggests that to understand the true face of the emperor, one must also read "Ye Shi," which portrays the emperor's life. 
The assumption is that only by combining these two perspectives, the official history, and the portrayal of the emperor's life, can one see the emperor's true face. 
This assumption is reflected in option [REDACTED].
