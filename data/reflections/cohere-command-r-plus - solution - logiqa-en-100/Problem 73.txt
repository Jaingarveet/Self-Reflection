Solution:
Given that G is in Team 1 and must be in the front position, we can deduce the following:
- From condition (3), L must be in Team 1.
- From condition (5), P cannot be in Team 1 as P and Q cannot be on the same team.
- K cannot be in Team 1 as, per condition (4), K and N cannot be on the same team, and N is required to be on Team 1 (as Q cannot be on the same team as N, per condition (4), and Q must be in Team 1 if H is in Team 2, per condition (6)).
- Therefore, the only possible pair in Team 1 with G and L are Q (as per condition 6, if H is in Team 2) and N.
- Thus, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.
