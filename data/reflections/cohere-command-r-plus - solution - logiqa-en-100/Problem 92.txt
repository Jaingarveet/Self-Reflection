Solution:
The question states that one professor is entirely correct, one is entirely wrong, and the remaining professor has one correct and one incorrect statement. 

Professor Zhao's statement is incorrect because it is given that one of the teams mentioned must be the champion. 

Professor Sun's statement is entirely wrong because his judgment contradicts Professor Qian, who we know has one correct statement. 

Therefore, Professor Qian has one correct and one incorrect statement. His statement about the champion not being Tsinghua University is correct, implying that the other part of his statement, about the University of Science and Technology of China, must be incorrect. 

As a result, the [REDACTED] must be the champion.
