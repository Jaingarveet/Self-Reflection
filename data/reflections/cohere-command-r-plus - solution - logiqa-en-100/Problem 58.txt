Solution:
The argument asserts a causal link between rising land prices and soaring housing costs. To cast doubt on this claim, we should seek evidence that suggests an alternative or additional factor influencing housing prices. 

Choice [REDACTED] provides information about Beijing, where housing prices rose only slightly while land prices increased minimally. This indicates that housing prices can rise even when land prices remain relatively stable, suggesting other factors are at play. Thus, choice [REDACTED] effectively raises doubt about the assertion.
