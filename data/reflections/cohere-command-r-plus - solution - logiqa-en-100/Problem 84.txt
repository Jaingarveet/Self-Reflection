Solution:
The original argument can be structured as follows:
Premise 1: All landscape rooms (A) can see the landscape (B).
Premise 2: Li Wenbing's family (C) cannot see the landscape (not B).
Conclusion: Therefore, Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room (not A).

This argument follows the form: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED]; [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]; therefore, [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED].

Now, let's analyze the correct choice, [REDACTED]:
Premise 1: Anyone who meets the basic conditions (A) can apply for a small loan (B).
Premise 2: Sun Wen (C) did not apply for a small loan (not B).
Conclusion: Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions (not A).

Choice [REDACTED] follows the same logical structure as the original argument:
- "Anyone who meets the basic conditions" is analogous to "All landscape rooms."
- "Can apply for a small loan" is analogous to "can see the landscape."
- "Sun Wen" is analogous to "Li Wenbing's family."
- "Did not apply for a small loan" is analogous to "cannot see the landscape."
