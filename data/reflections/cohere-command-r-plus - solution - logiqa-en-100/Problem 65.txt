Solution:
The survey's inconsistency is that strict investigations of drunk driving did not lead to a noticeable reduction in traffic accidents when compared to cities without such measures. 

Choice [REDACTED] reveals that severe investigations of drunk driving have already been implemented in urban areas, which is crucial context. This information suggests that the expected impact of strict investigations was not observed, potentially due to other factors influencing accident rates. 

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED].
