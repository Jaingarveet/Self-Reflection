Solution:
Given that X and F are in the same department, and F must be in production (condition 4), X is also in the production department. 
According to condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. 
However, this condition does not apply in this scenario because X is in production, not sales. 
Therefore, there is no restriction on W's department allocation due to condition (3). 

H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1). 
There are three positions in production and three in sales, so both departments are viable options for H and Y. 
Let's consider the options for G:
- If G is in production, then H and Y could be in sales, and W could be in either department. In this case, statement [REDACTED] could be true.
- If G is in sales, then H and Y must be in production to satisfy condition (2). Again, W could be in either department, so statement [REDACTED] could still be true.

Therefore, statement [REDACTED] can be true even when X and F are in the same department, and it is not a correct answer choice. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED].
