Solution:
The argument claims that an external world exists because of our visual experiences and the success of natural science.

Choice [REDACTED]: This statement questions the validity of using sensory evidence, implying that the existence of an external world is already assumed in the mind. It does not directly support or align with the argument and can be seen as a doubt or rebuttal.

Choice [REDACTED]: Questioning how we know that others share similar visual experiences does not directly refute the argument's claim about the existence of an external world. It is a valid point but does not constitute a strong doubt or rebuttal.

Choice [REDACTED]: Affirming the reliability of visual experiences and claiming that mirages are real does not rebut or doubt the argument. It supports the idea that sensory evidence is valid.

Choice [REDACTED]: This choice brings up a critical point. It questions why natural science has achieved success if there is no external world for it to reflect and operate upon. This choice directly challenges the argument's claim that natural science supports the existence of an external world. Therefore, it does not constitute doubt or rebuttal.

The correct answer is, indeed, choice [REDACTED].
