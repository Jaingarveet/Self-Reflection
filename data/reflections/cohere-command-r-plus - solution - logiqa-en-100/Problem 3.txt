Solution:
The context presents a set of conditions for starting a successful company. It suggests that to enter the market competition and have a chance at success, you must know that you excel in at least one key area. These areas are compared to competitors and include product, speed, cost, and added value. 

The phrase "you have to know that you are great in one thing" sets a prerequisite or necessary condition for even considering market entry. It does not guarantee success but rather positions it as a requirement to be competitive. 

Choice [REDACTED] accurately reflects this necessary condition by stating, "If your company does the best in at least one thing, it will gain a foothold in market competition." This choice conveys that excellence in one area is a requirement for entering the market and having the opportunity to succeed.
