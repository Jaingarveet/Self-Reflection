Solution:
Given:
- Zhang Shan's bonus > Li Si's bonus
- Wang Wu's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus
- Zhang Shan's bonus > Wang Wu's bonus

Inference: Zhang Shan's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus

To make the inference hold, we need to assume that:
1. Li Si's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus (from 1 and inference)
2. Wang Wu's bonus > Li Si's bonus (from 3 and 1)

Assumption [REDACTED]: Wang Wu's bonus > Li Si's bonus. This assumption is not necessary for the inference, as it does not provide any additional information.

Assumption [REDACTED]: Li Si's bonus > Miao Xiaoqin's bonus. This assumption is implicit in the inference and, therefore, is not an exception.

Assumption [REDACTED]: There is no such assumption. This choice is irrelevant to the inference.

Assumption [REDACTED]: There is no such assumption. This statement directly contradicts the given information and cannot be true.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED], as it is the only assumption that is not required for the inference to hold.
