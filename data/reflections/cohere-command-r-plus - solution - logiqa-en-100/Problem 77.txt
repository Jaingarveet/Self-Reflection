Solution:

Given that the printing group consists of G, H, and L, and conditions (2), (3), and (4) must be satisfied, we can deduce the following: 

- F and K cannot be in the same group (condition 2).
- J and K must be in the same group (condition 3).
- M must be in either the printing or binding group (condition 4). 

To maximize the number of common members between the two groups, we can assign J and K to the binding group, ensuring they are in the same group as required by condition (3). Additionally, we can place M in the binding group to satisfy condition (4). 

This results in the binding group having at least one more member than the printing group (4 members vs. 3 members), which is the statement provided in choice [REDACTED].
