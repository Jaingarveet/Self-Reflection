Solution:
The original statements are: "Money is like dung" (statement 1) and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" (statement 2). Statement 1 can be true or false, and statement 2 implies that friends have monetary value. 

Now, let's examine choice [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]" This choice introduces a conditional statement that directly addresses the relationship between "friends" and "money." If friends are worth a lot of money, then it contradicts the idea that "money is like dung." This choice correctly identifies the logical relationship and refutes the fallacy.
