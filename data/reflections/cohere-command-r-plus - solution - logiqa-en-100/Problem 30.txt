Solution:
1. Condition 2 states that if E is selected, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must also be selected. So, we consider the scenario where E is selected.
2. Condition 1 states that at least one person from Bingding must be selected. Ding is the only person from Bingding left if [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and E are chosen.
3. Condition 3 states that a maximum of 2 people can be selected. If we select E, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and Ding, we have selected four people, which violates this condition.
4. Therefore, it is not possible to select E and follow all the conditions. This means that E must be the one left out in the fourth, and the correct answer is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]"
