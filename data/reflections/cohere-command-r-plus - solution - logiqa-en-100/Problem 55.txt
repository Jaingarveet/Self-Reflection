Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and step-by-step construct a valid arrangement for the second team:
1. Condition (1) states that G or H can be on the team, and if so, they must be in the front. We'll choose H for the front position.
2. Condition (2) specifies that K must be in the middle position.
3. Condition (3) is about Team 1, so we can ignore it for now.
4. Condition (4) states that P and N cannot be in the same team as K. This means that neither P nor N can be on the second team since K is already there.
5. Condition (5) states that P and Q cannot be in the same team. This means that P cannot be on the second team, as K is already there.
6. Condition (6) is about Team 2, but it depends on Team 1's arrangement, so we'll come back to it.

Based on the above, we know that the second team's front position is H, the middle position is K, and the remaining magician could be G, L, or Q, as they have not been placed yet, and there are no conditions preventing them from being on this team.

Now, let's revisit condition (6): if H is in Team 2, then Q must be in the middle of Team 1. We already have K in the middle of Team 2, so Q cannot be on the same team as K. This leaves us with only G or L for the remaining position on Team 2.

Therefore, the acceptable arrangement for the second team is: Front: H, Middle: K, Back: G or L. This matches choice [REDACTED].
