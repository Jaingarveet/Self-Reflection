Solution:

Given that J and K are children, and Dr. Zhang and Dr. Li are responsible for treating them, we can deduce the following: 

Dr. Zhang treats J (a male child) and either E or F (male adults) to fulfill condition (1). 

Dr. Li treats K (a male child) and one of the female patients (G, H, or I) to fulfill condition (3). 

Therefore, we can conclude that choice [REDACTED] is correct: J must be treated by Dr. Zhang according to the given conditions.
