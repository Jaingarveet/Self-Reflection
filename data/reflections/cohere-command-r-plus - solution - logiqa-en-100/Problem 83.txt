Solution:
Given that H doesn't participate, we can deduce the following:
- Either E or F will participate (but not both).
- If E participates, then F does not, and vice versa.
- M's participation is dependent on F's participation. If F participates, M must also participate.
- J and K cannot both participate. If one participates, the other does not.
- If J participates, G must also participate.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. If F participates, E does not. This satisfies the first condition. M's participation is not mandatory but can be true. If J participates, G must participate as well. This satisfies the last condition. K's participation is not addressed, but that's okay because it's not a requirement for K to participate.
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This pair doesn't satisfy the conditions. If E participates, F cannot, which means M also cannot participate (as M depends on F).
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This pair doesn't work because if F participates, E cannot. This leaves the option of J participating, which then requires G to participate, contradicting the condition that at most one of J or K can participate.
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This option doesn't work because if K participates, J cannot, which means G also cannot participate.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
