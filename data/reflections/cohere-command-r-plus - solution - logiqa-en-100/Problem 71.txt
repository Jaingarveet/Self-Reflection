Solution:
The contradiction arises because most people have a positive view of college students as nannies, but few are willing to hire them. 
Choice [REDACTED] provides the most reasonable explanation for this contradiction. 
It reveals that respondents who favor the idea of college students as nannies do so primarily because they believe it benefits the students themselves rather than because they expect superior housekeeping services. 
This suggests a disconnect between their abstract support for the concept and their personal willingness to implement it.
