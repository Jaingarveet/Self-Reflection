Solution:
Given: 
1. H and Y must be in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be in the same department.
3. F is allocated to the production department.
4. If X is in sales, then W is in production.

From condition 2, G cannot be in production as F is already allocated there. 
From condition 4, if X is in sales, W is in production, so G cannot be paired with X in sales due to condition 2. 
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
