Solution:
Given the conditions: 
1. H and Y must be in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be in the same department. 
3. The relationship between X and W: if X is in sales, then W is in production. This condition does not restrict their allocation if X is not in sales. 
4. F must be in the production department. 

Deductions: 
1. H and Y are allocated to the same department, which could be production or sales, but not public relations. 
2. F is allocated to the production department. This means G is allocated to either sales or public relations, as they cannot be in the same department. 
3. X and W are not restricted to specific departments unless X is allocated to sales, in which case W will be in production. 

Now, evaluating the choices: 
Choice [REDACTED]: 
- H and Y are in the production department, satisfying condition 1. 
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4. 
- G is in sales, satisfying the deduction that G should be in sales or public relations. 
- However, this allocation does not satisfy condition 3 because if X is in sales, W should be in production, but in this choice, W is allocated to public relations. 

Choice [REDACTED]: 
- H and Y are in the production department, satisfying condition 1.
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4.
- G is in sales, satisfying the deduction that G should be in sales or public relations.
- However, this allocation implies that X is not in sales, which contradicts condition 3. Therefore, this choice is invalid. 

Choice [REDACTED]: 
- H and Y are in sales, satisfying condition 1. 
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4. 
- G is in production, contradicting condition 2, as F and G should not be in the same department. 

Choice [REDACTED]: 
- H and Y are in sales, satisfying condition 1.
- F is in production, satisfying condition 4.
- G is in sales, satisfying the deduction that G should be in sales or public relations, and also satisfying condition 2 as F and G are not in the same department. 
- X is in public relations, which satisfies condition 3 because X is not in sales, so there is no restriction on W's department. W can be allocated to production.
