  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I didn't carefully read the text and consider all possible options.
I mistakenly assumed that the scene was set in a gym, and therefore, the most likely completion would be a group of gymnast students taking a sixth step on a gym floor.
However, upon re-reading the text, it's clear that the scene is actually describing a man using an exercise machine while another man gives directions, and the most likely completion is a title screen showing the man pulling the handle from the ground up on the same machine.
