  Action: Answer("D")

Explanation:
The correct answer is D. The text is providing instructions on how to clean a dryer drum, and the previous step mentioned unplugging the dryer to prevent accidents. Therefore, the next step would naturally be to ensure that the dryer is properly unplugged. Option D provides the necessary steps to ensure that the dryer is safely unplugged, which aligns with the context of the instructions.

Option A does not relate to unplugging the dryer and instead jumps to removing an inside fitting, which is not the next logical step.

Option B mentions static behind the agitator coils, but this is not relevant to unplugging the dryer.

Option C provides an incorrect location for the plug, which is not helpful in unplugging the dryer.

Therefore, the best answer is D.
