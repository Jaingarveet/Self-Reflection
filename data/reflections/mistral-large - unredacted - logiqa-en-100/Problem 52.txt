Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not carefully read the instructions and assumed that there was an option for "None of the Above."

Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the instructions
 - Assuming an option not provided
 - Not considering all available choices

Solution:
The statement discusses the relationship between cost and profit, and how they are inversely related. The employees' wages are part of the cost, while the boss's profit is not included in the cost. Therefore, if the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, their interests would conflict with the boss's interests. The employee would want higher wages (higher cost), while the boss would want lower costs (higher profit).

Instructions:
1. Read the question and all available choices carefully.
2. Identify the relationship between cost and profit.
3. Consider how the employees' wages and the boss's profit are related to cost.
4. Evaluate each choice in terms of how it relates to the relationship between cost and profit.
5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the statement.

Advice:
 - Always read the question and all available choices carefully.
 - Do not assume that there is an option for "None of the Above."
 - Consider all available choices and evaluate them in terms of the information provided in the statement.
 - Focus on the relationships between the different elements in the statement.
 - Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the statement, even if it is not explicitly stated.
