Solution:
The statement presents a contradiction between the fact that seals have died from eating a contaminated fish, but some people have not been poisoned after eating the same fish. The correct answer choice should help explain this contradiction.

Choice A is incorrect because it does not explain why some people have not been poisoned after eating the fish.
Choice C is incorrect because it introduces a new contradiction that is not relevant to the original statement.
Choice D is incorrect because it does not explain why some people have not been poisoned after eating the fish.
Choice B is the correct answer because it explains that the toxic chemicals are concentrated in the parts of the fish that seals eat but people do not.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the contradiction presented in the statement.
2. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best explains the contradiction.
3. Eliminate answer choices that do not explain the contradiction or introduce new contradictions.
