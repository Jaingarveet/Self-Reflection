Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not fully consider the implications of each choice.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in my understanding of the problem.
I did not fully understand the expert's point of view and how each choice could raise doubts about it.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete understanding of the problem
 - Inadequate consideration of each choice
 - Misunderstanding of the expert's point of view
Solution:
The expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow larger ships to pass through.
Choice A supports the expert's point of view, as it shows that the inability of large ships to pass through the bridge is causing transportation issues.
Choice B raises doubts about the expert's point of view, as it suggests that most international ships are moored at ports below the bridge and rarely have large external ships berthed above Nanjing.
Choice C raises doubts about the expert's point of view, as it suggests that dismantling only the Nanjing Bridge would not be enough to allow larger ships to pass through, as there are other bridges with the same clear height.
Choice D raises doubts about the expert's point of view, as it shows that shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where 8000-ton ships can pass through the bridge.
The correct answer is choice D, as it shows that shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where larger ships can pass through the bridge, which directly contradicts the expert's point of view.
