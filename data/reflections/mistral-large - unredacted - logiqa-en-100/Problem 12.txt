Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the assumption that image thinking methods lead to major scientific breakthroughs, rather than the assumption that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.

Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Focus error
 - Misinterpretation error

Solution:
The conclusion assumes that Nobel Prize winners have made major scientific breakthroughs.
The assumption is based on the observation that Nobel Prize winners make more use of image thinking methods than general scientists.
The assumption is necessary to support the conclusion that image thinking methods help to achieve major scientific breakthroughs.

Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the assumption that supports the conclusion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption.
4. Choose the answer that matches the assumption.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conclusion and assumption of the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption.
 - Never assume that the correct answer is the one that seems most obvious.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that assumptions are often unstated and must be inferred from the argument.
