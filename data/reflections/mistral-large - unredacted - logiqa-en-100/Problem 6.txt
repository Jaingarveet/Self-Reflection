Solution:
Given that the team does not go to I Peak, they cannot reach Lake J (rule 4).
Since they cannot go to Lake J, they must go to Lake G (rule 1).
If they go to Lake G, they must go to either City E or City F (rule 2).
If they go to City E, they must go to Mountain H (rule 3).
However, going to City E and Mountain H is not a requirement if they go to City F and Lake G.
Therefore, the group went to City F and Lake G.
