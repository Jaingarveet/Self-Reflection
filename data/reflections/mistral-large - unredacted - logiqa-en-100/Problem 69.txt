Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the logic behind the inference.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the relationship between the bonuses of the individuals involved.
I incorrectly assumed that the only assumption that contradicts the inference is that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
However, the correct answer is that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, which does not contradict the inference.

Error Keywords:
 - Logic error
 - Inference error
 - Assumption error

Solution:
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
This inference is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.
The only assumption that contradicts this inference is that Li Si's bonus is higher than Wang Wu's.
However, the correct answer is that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's, which does not contradict the inference.

Instructions:
1. Identify the inference being made in the question.
2. Identify the assumptions that are given in the question.
3. Determine which assumption contradicts the inference.
4. Read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.
5. Choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the inference being made in the question.
 - Always identify the assumptions that are given in the question.
 - Always determine which assumption contradicts the inference.
 - Always read each answer choice carefully and evaluate whether it contradicts the inference.
 - Always choose the answer that does not contradict the inference.
 - Remember that assumptions are not necessarily true, but are used to make an inference.
 - Remember that the correct answer may not contradict the inference, but rather be consistent with it.
