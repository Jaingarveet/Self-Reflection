Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is replenished. However, the information provided does not state that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is replenished.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Causal reasoning error
 - Proportional reasoning error
Solution:
The information provided states that the rate at which cabin air is replenished in commercial airliners has decreased since 1985. This suggests that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air has increased since 1985.
The information provided also states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. This suggests that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985.
However, the information provided does not state that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air is directly proportional to the rate at which the air is replenished. Therefore, I cannot conclude that the level of carbon dioxide in cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower in 1980 than it is today on a similar flight.
