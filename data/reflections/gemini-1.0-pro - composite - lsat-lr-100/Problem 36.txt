Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption on which the argument depends. 
My error was in assuming that the argument relies on the claim that non-native speakers hear speech more accurately than native speakers. 
However, the argument actually relies on the claim that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than the perceptions of non-native speakers.
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption identification error
 - Argument interpretation error
 - False assumption error
Solution:
The argument claims that native speakers' perception of their own language as sequences of separate words is an illusion. 
This illusion is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
The argument assumes that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify the main claim.
2. Identify the evidence provided to support the main claim.
3. Identify the conclusion drawn from the evidence.
4. Identify the assumptions on which the argument depends.
5. Evaluate the strength of the argument by considering the assumptions, evidence, and conclusion.
6. Choose the answer that correctly identifies the assumption on which the argument depends.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Consider the logical relationships between the different parts of the argument.
 - Do not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the argument.
 - Be aware of common fallacies and logical errors.
 - Evaluate the argument as a whole, not just individual parts.
