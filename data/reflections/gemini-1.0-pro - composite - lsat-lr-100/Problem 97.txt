Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the role of the statement in the argument.

Solution:
The editorial argues that cell-phone use on airplanes would be more upsetting than on buses and trains. 
This claim is supported by the statement that airline passengers are usually packed in tightly and cannot move to another seat if they are offended by their seatmates' cell-phone use. 
This conclusion, in turn, supports the main conclusion of the argument, which is that proposals to allow cell-phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.

1. Identify the main conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the premises that support the main conclusion.
