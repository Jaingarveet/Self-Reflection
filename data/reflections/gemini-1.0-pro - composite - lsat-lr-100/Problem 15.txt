Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the specific risks Morgenstern mentioned rather than the broader issue of the argument's structure. 
My error was in not recognizing the flawed assumption underlying Morgenstern's reasoning.
Error Keywords:
 - Flawed assumption
 - False dilemma
 - Oversimplification
Solution:
Morgenstern's argument is flawed because it fails to consider the varying degrees of unhappiness. 
Even if Brooks is already unhappy, quitting could lead to a more significant or intense unhappiness if they are unable to find a new job.
Instructions:
1. Identify the main argument being made.
2. Analyze the underlying assumptions of the argument.
3. Determine whether the assumptions are valid or flawed.
4. Consider alternative possibilities and potential consequences.
5. Evaluate the argument's overall strength and validity based on its assumptions and potential outcomes.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the structure of arguments and identify any underlying assumptions.
 - Evaluate the validity of assumptions and consider alternative possibilities.
 - Recognize that arguments can be flawed even if they contain some element of truth.
 - Be cautious of arguments that oversimplify complex issues or present false dilemmas.
 - Consider the potential consequences of different courses of action before making a decision.
