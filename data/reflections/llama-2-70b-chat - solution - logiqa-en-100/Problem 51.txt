Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions again:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
4. F must be allocated in the production department.

Now, let's consider all possible allocations:

1. X and F in the public relations department.
2. X in the sales department, F in the production department.
3. X in the production department, F in the sales department.
4. X and F in the sales department.

We can eliminate option 4 as it violates condition 1.

Now, let's evaluate the remaining options:

1. X and F in the public relations department.
This satisfies all conditions.
2. X in the sales department, F in the production department.
This satisfies conditions 1 and 4 but violates condition 2.
3. X in the production department, F in the sales department.
This satisfies conditions 1 and 4 but violates condition 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is option 1: X and F in the public relations department.
