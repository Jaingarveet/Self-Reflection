Solution:
Let's revisit the problem:
[REDACTED] company has six general manager assistants F, G, H, I, M, and P, and three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants. Each assistant general manager is in charge of at least one department. The following conditions must be met:

1. There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
2. F and G are not in charge of the same department.
3. H and I are not in charge of the same department.

We know that F and M are not in charge of the same department. We can conclude that F is in charge of one department, and M is in charge of another department.

Let's consider all possible combinations:

* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. However, this would violate condition (2), since F and M are not in charge of the same department.
* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. However, this would violate condition (2), since F and M are not in charge of the same department.
* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. However, this would violate condition (3), since H and I are not in charge of the same department.
* F is in charge of departments [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. In this case, M must be in charge of department [REDACTED], E, or F, since they cannot be in charge of the same department as F. This possibility satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, we can conclude that option [REDACTED] is correct: [REDACTED]
