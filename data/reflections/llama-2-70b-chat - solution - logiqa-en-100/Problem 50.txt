Solution:
When valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 must be opened, and valve No. 5 must be closed, according to rule 1. 
According to rule 2, valve No. 4 must be closed if valve No. 2 or valve No. 5 is opened. 
Therefore, when valve No. 1 is opened, valve No. 2 and valve No. 3 must be opened, as valve No. 5 is closed.
