Solution:
We know that J is the fourth speaker, and F speaks in the first or third place. So, if F is not the third speaker, then F must be the first speaker.

If F is the first speaker, then N must be the second speaker, as there is only one speaker between M and N, and N must speak after lunch.

So, the third speaker would be either [REDACTED], as they both speak before lunch. But we know that G must speak before lunch, so the third speaker must be L.

M must be the fifth speaker, as it is the only remaining speaker.
