Solution:

1. If H does not participate in the game, then we can deduce that either E or F must participate.
2. Since J or K must participate, and H is not participating, J must participate.
3. Since J participates, G participates.
4. Since F is not participating, M does not participate.
5. Therefore, the two players that must be included in the game are [REDACTED].
