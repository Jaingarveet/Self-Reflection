Solution:
Let's analyze the given information and constraints:

1. At least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.
2. If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.
3. If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.
4. Only when I cross the I peak can I reach Lake J.

From constraint 1, we know that Lake G or Lake J must be visited.
From constraint 2, we know that if the team doesn't visit E city or F city, they cannot visit Lake G.
From constraint 3, we know that if the team doesn't visit E city, they cannot visit H mountain.
From constraint 4, we know that the team must cross I peak to reach Lake J.

Now, let's consider the given options:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is not possible, as the team cannot visit Lake J if they don't cross I peak.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is possible, as the team can visit City E instead of City F, and still visit Lake G.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is not possible, as the team cannot visit Lake G if they don't visit E city or F city.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This option is possible, as the team can visit City F and Lake G, and still have the opportunity to visit H mountain.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
