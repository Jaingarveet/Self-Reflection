Solution:
The blogger's conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is based on the number of follow-up posts agreeing with their opinion. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people agree with their analysis. To accurately determine if most people agree with the blogger's analysis, a random sample of people should be surveyed, rather than relying on follow-up posts from potentially biased sources.
