Solution:
We can start by analyzing the given conditions:

* Condition 1: Both groups must have at least 3 employees, so [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M in the printing group, and [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and J in the binding group meet this condition.
* Condition 2: [REDACTED] and K cannot be in the same group. Since K is not in the printing group, this condition is met.
* Condition 3: If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Since K is not in the printing group, this condition is met.
* Condition 4: M is at least one of the members of these two groups. M is in the printing group, so this condition is met.
* Condition 5: At least one of the same employees in both groups must be replaced.

Now, let's consider the question: If the members of the printing group are composed of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M, and the members of the binding group are composed of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and J, then K can replace which member of the two groups without violating any of the given conditions?

We can see that K can replace [REDACTED] in the binding group without violating any of the conditions. [REDACTED] is not in the printing group, so Condition 2 is met. Conditions 1, 3, and 4 are also met since the number of employees in each group remains the same, and M is still a member of one of the groups. Condition 5 is also met since [REDACTED] is replaced by K in the binding group.

Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
