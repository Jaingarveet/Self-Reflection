Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions again:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
4. F must be allocated in the production department.

From condition 3, we know that X and W cannot be allocated to the same department. Therefore, option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], is not a valid pair for the sales department.

Instead, let's consider option [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. If G is allocated to the sales department, X must be allocated to the production department, according to condition 3. This satisfies all the conditions and is a valid pair for the sales department.

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].
