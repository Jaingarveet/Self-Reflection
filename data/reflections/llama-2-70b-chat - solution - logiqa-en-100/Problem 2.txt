Solution:
We know that Chessman [REDACTED] defeated Chessman [REDACTED] and Chessman [REDACTED] applauded Chessman [REDACTED]. This means that Chessman [REDACTED] is stronger than Chessman [REDACTED].
In the second round, Chess Armor will play against Chessman [REDACTED]. Since Chessman [REDACTED] is stronger than Chessman [REDACTED], it is likely that Chessman [REDACTED] will win against Chess Armor.
However, we cannot definitively say that Chessman [REDACTED] will win, as there is still a possibility that Chess Armor could win.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
