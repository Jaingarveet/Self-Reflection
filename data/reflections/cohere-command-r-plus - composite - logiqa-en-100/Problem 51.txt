Explanation:
I misinterpreted condition (3) and made an error in assigning W to the sales department. 
The correct interpretation of condition (3) is that if X is in sales, then W must be in production, not sales. 
This changes the department allocation for W and subsequently impacts the conclusion about G's department. 
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Misinterpretation
- Condition misinterpretation
Solution:
Given that X and F are in the same department, and F must be in production (condition 4), X is also in the production department. 
According to condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. 
However, this condition does not apply in this scenario because X is in production, not sales. 
Therefore, there is no restriction on W's department allocation due to condition (3). 

H and Y must be in the same department (condition 1). 
There are three positions in production and three in sales, so both departments are viable options for H and Y. 
Let's consider the options for G:
- If G is in production, then H and Y could be in sales, and W could be in either department. In this case, statement [REDACTED] could be true.
- If G is in sales, then H and Y must be in production to satisfy condition (2). Again, W could be in either department, so statement [REDACTED] could still be true.

Therefore, statement [REDACTED] can be true even when X and F are in the same department, and it is not a correct answer choice. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the given condition: X and F are in the same department.
2. Determine the department of X based on the given conditions.
3. Refer to condition (3) and understand that it applies only when X is in sales.
4. Recognize that condition (3) does not restrict W's department allocation in this scenario.
5. Consider the options for H and Y, given that they must be in the same department.
6. Evaluate the truth of each statement choice based on the possible department allocations.
7. Choose the statement that cannot be true under any allocation scenario.

Advice:
 - Read and understand all the given conditions carefully.
 - Identify the relationships and restrictions imposed by each condition.
 - Diagram the relationships and restrictions to help visualize the problem.
 - Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the conditions.
 - Evaluate each statement choice independently and avoid making assumptions.
 - Avoid overinterpreting the conditions and only draw conclusions that are explicitly supported.
