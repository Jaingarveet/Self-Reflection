Solution:
Given that H doesn't participate, we can deduce the following:
- Either E or F will participate (but not both).
- If E participates, then F does not, and vice versa.
- M's participation is dependent on F's participation. If F participates, M must also participate.
- J and K cannot both participate. If one participates, the other does not.
- If J participates, G must also participate.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. If F participates, E does not. This satisfies the first condition. M's participation is not mandatory but can be true. If J participates, G must participate as well. This satisfies the last condition. K's participation is not addressed, but that's okay because it's not a requirement for K to participate.
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This pair doesn't satisfy the conditions. If E participates, F cannot, which means M also cannot participate (as M depends on F).
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This pair doesn't work because if F participates, E cannot. This leaves the option of J participating, which then requires G to participate, contradicting the condition that at most one of J or K can participate.
- Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This option doesn't work because if K participates, J cannot, which means G also cannot participate.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions and list them out clearly. 
2. Understand the implications of each condition and how they relate to one another. 
3. Consider the options provided and evaluate them against the conditions. 
4. For each option, determine if it satisfies all the conditions or if there is a contradiction. 
5. Choose the option that satisfies all conditions without contradiction. 

Advice:
- Carefully read and understand the conditions provided in the question. 
- Break down complex conditions into simpler, more manageable parts. 
- Consider all relevant implications of each condition and how they interact. 
- Evaluate each option thoroughly and systematically, checking for satisfaction of all conditions. 
- Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions; work logically through the options. 
- Double-check your reasoning to ensure it aligns with the provided conditions.
