Solution:

Given that J and K are children, and Dr. Zhang and Dr. Li are responsible for treating them, we can deduce the following: 

Dr. Zhang treats J (a male child) and either E or F (male adults) to fulfill condition (1). 

Dr. Li treats K (a male child) and one of the female patients (G, H, or I) to fulfill condition (3). 

Therefore, we can conclude that choice [REDACTED] is correct: J must be treated by Dr. Zhang according to the given conditions. 

Instructions:

1. Identify the given conditions and requirements: 
    - Dr. Zhang treats only male patients. 
    - Dr. Li can treat only one patient. 
    - If a doctor treats a child, they must also treat an adult of the same sex. 

2. Consider the characteristics of the patients (adult/child, male/female) and the limitations on the doctors' assignments. 

3. Deduce the most likely assignments based on the conditions. 

4. Determine which of the choices must be true according to the conditions. 

Advice:

- Carefully consider all given conditions and their implications. 
- Systematically analyze the characteristics and relationships between the patients and doctors. 
- Avoid making assumptions that go beyond what is given or implied by the conditions. 
- Look for necessary connections between the conditions and the choices to determine which must be true.
