Solution:
The expert's viewpoint is that the bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to accommodate larger ships. 
Choice [REDACTED] suggests that ships can already be designed to adapt to the passage, implying that the bridge modification may not be necessary. This choice, therefore, raises the most doubts about the expert's viewpoint. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the task: identify the expert's viewpoint and look for the option that casts the most doubt on it. 
2. Analyze each choice: consider how it relates to the expert's viewpoint and whether it supports or contradicts it. 
3. Identify misinterpretations: ensure you correctly identify the option that creates the most doubt. 
4. Contextualize: consider the implications of each choice and how they might affect the need for the proposed solution. 

Advice:
- Carefully read and understand the context, the expert's viewpoint, and the task at hand. 
- Ensure you interpret the task correctly; look for options that cast doubt, not support the viewpoint. 
- Analyze each choice critically, considering its implications and how it relates to the broader context. 
- Avoid making assumptions or overlooking important details; focus on the specific arguments and evidence presented.
