Solution:
The argument is that the renaming of a family magazine to "Inferno," with a shift to violent and pornographic content, led to advertisers withdrawing due to ethical concerns. 
The key to strengthening this argument is to provide additional evidence that suggests advertisers are indeed concerned about ethical responsibilities, not just economic benefits.

Choice [REDACTED] discusses the cost and selling price of "Inferno" compared to another magazine, "Harbour." While this might provide some context, it does not directly strengthen the argument about advertisers' ethical considerations.

Choice [REDACTED] indicates that the advertisers who refused to renew their contracts with "Inferno" did not suffer financially. While this could be interesting information, it does not directly support the argument that advertisers consider ethical responsibilities.

Choice [REDACTED] mentions that readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content. While this is somewhat relevant to the context, it does not directly address the advertisers' actions or motivations.

Choice [REDACTED] reveals that some advertisers from other family magazines are turning to "Inferno." This directly strengthens the argument by showing that the ethical stance taken by the original advertisers is an important factor in their decision-making. It demonstrates that advertisers are responsive to the content and image of the publications they choose, indicating their awareness of ethical responsibilities.
