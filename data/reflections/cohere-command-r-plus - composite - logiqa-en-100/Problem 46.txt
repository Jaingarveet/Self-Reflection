Explanation:
I overlooked the condition that if X is in sales, then W must be in production. 
This means that the pair that cannot be assigned to sales is [REDACTED], as G and F cannot be in the same department, and F is in production. 
Error Keywords:
- Overlooked condition
- Misinterpreted constraint
Solution:
Given: 
1. H and Y must be in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be in the same department.
3. F is allocated to the production department.
4. If X is in sales, then W is in production.

From condition 2, G cannot be in production as F is already allocated there. 
From condition 4, if X is in sales, W is in production, so G cannot be paired with X in sales due to condition 2. 
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions and list them clearly.
2. Start with the easiest constraints first: H and Y must be in the same department.
3. Identify the employees that cannot be in the same department as F: G.
4. Determine the department of F: Production.
5. Consider the implication of X being in sales: W is in production.
6. Now, consider which pairs are unlikely to be in sales together: [REDACTED].
7. [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together as G cannot be in the same department as F, and F is in production.
Advice:
- Always list the given conditions clearly before starting.
- Start with the simplest constraints first and build from there.
- Consider the implications of each condition step-by-step.
- Look for direct contradictions or incompatibilities when evaluating pairs or combinations.
- Double-check your reasoning against each condition to ensure you haven't overlooked anything.
