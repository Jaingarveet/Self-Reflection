Advice:
 - Always read the argument and question carefully and understand what they are asking for.
 - Always identify the conclusion, evidence, and assumptions in the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice and consider how it would weaken the argument.
 - Never assume that the argument is based on the same evidence or conclusion as the question.
 - Always consider alternative explanations for the evidence presented in the argument.
