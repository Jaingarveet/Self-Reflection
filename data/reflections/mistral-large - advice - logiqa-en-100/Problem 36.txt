Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument being made.
 - Always evaluate each option in relation to the argument.
 - Always consider the implications of each option.
 - Never assume that an option weakens the argument without careful evaluation.
 - Always double-check your evaluation of each option and the final answer.
 - Remember that the option that does not weaken the argument may not necessarily strengthen it, but simply not contradict it.
