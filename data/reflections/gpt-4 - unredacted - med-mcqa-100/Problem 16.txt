Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the anastomotic connections that would maintain blood supply to the upper limb in the event of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery. I incorrectly thought that the anastomosis between the posterior circumflex humeral artery and the circumflex scapular artery would be responsible for maintaining blood flow, when in fact, it is the anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery that would do so.

- Blood supply
- Anastomosis
- Axillary artery
Solution:
In the event of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery, the anastomosis that would maintain the blood supply to the upper limb is between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery. This is because these arteries form an anastomotic network that can provide collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what it is asking.
2. Recall the anatomy of the axillary artery and its branches.
3. Recall the concept of anastomosis and how it can maintain blood supply in case of obstruction.
4. Identify the correct anastomotic connections that would maintain blood supply to the upper limb in the event of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery.
5. Choose the answer that correctly identifies these anastomotic connections.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it is asking.
- Review and understand the anatomy of the axillary artery and its branches.
- Understand the concept of anastomosis and how it can maintain blood supply in case of obstruction.
- Practice identifying the correct anastomotic connections in different scenarios.
- Always double-check your answer before finalizing it.
