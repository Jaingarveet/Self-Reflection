Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the potential impact of placenta previa on the position of the fetus. I incorrectly assumed that placenta previa would present with other symptoms and therefore could not be the cause of an unstable lie.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Incorrect assumption
- Gynaecology & Obstetrics
Solution:
An unstable lie can be due to several reasons, including placenta previa. Placenta previa is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the mother's cervix, which is the outlet for the uterus. This can cause the baby to change positions frequently, resulting in an unstable lie. Even though placenta previa often presents with other symptoms such as bleeding, it can still be the cause of an unstable lie even in the absence of these symptoms.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and the medical condition being asked about.
2. Review each answer choice and consider how it could potentially cause the condition.
3. Remember that placenta previa can cause an unstable lie, even if other symptoms are not present.
4. Choose the answer that is the most likely cause of the condition based on the information given in the question.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the medical condition being asked about.
- Don't make assumptions about the presence or absence of other symptoms unless this information is given in the question.
- Review each answer choice carefully and consider how it could potentially cause the condition.
- Remember that the most common cause of a condition may not always be the correct answer, especially if the question provides specific information about the patient's history or current situation.
