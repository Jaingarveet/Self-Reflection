Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I confused the antigen involved in Cicatricial pemphigoid with that of Bullous pemphigoid. In Bullous pemphigoid, the antibodies target BP antigen 1 & 2, while in Cicatricial pemphigoid, the antibodies target XVII collagen.
Error Keywords:
- Misidentification
- Confusion between similar diseases
- Incorrect antigen association
Solution:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease where the body's immune system produces antibodies against certain proteins in the skin and mucous membranes. The antigen that is bound by IgG in Cicatricial pemphigoid is XVII collagen, not BP antigen 1 & 2. Therefore, the correct answer is "A: XVII collagen".
Instructions:
1. Understand the disease in question - Cicatricial pemphigoid.
2. Recall that it is an autoimmune blistering disease.
3. Remember that the antibodies in this disease target XVII collagen.
4. Identify the correct answer as "A: XVII collagen".
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the disease in question.
- Be careful not to confuse similar diseases and their associated antigens.
- Take time to recall the specific details of each disease, including the antigens involved.
- Double-check your answer before finalizing it to avoid mistakes.
