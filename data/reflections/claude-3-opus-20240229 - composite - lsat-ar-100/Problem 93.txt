Explanation:
I incorrectly selected choice [REDACTED] as a possible true statement, failing to fully consider all the given conditions. Specifically, I overlooked that if none of the clients has a website target of 2 days, and Image's website target is 1 day (to be shorter than its voicemail target), then Solide's website target must be 3 days. This makes choice [REDACTED] impossible.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Overlooking constraints
 - Failing to consider all conditions
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
1. None of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
4. None of the clients has a website target of 2 days.
5. If no website target is 2 days, and Image's website target is 1 day (the shortest possible to be less than its voicemail target), then Solide and Truvest must have website targets of 3 days.
6. Image's voicemail target is 1 day (condition 2), Solide's voicemail target could be 2 days, and Truvest's 3 days. This satisfies all conditions and makes choice [REDACTED] possible.
7. All other choices contradict at least one of the given conditions.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and list out all given conditions.
2. Consider the implications of each condition, both individually and in combination.
3. Methodically evaluate each answer choice against all conditions.
4. Eliminate choices that contradict any of the conditions.
5. Identify the choice(s) that remain possible given all conditions.
6. If multiple choices seem possible, look for additional implications of the conditions that might eliminate some choices.
7. Select the choice that satisfies all conditions and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always fully consider the implications of all given conditions and constraints.
 - Be thorough in evaluating each answer choice against all conditions.
 - If a choice seems possible, double-check it against each condition to be sure.
 - Look for implicit implications of the conditions that might not be immediately obvious.
 - Don't select an answer until you've confirmed it fully satisfies all conditions.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices, seeing which could be possible and which are definitively impossible.
