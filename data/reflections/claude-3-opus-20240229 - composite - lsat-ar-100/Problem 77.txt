Explanation:
I miscounted the number of employees whose parking space assignment is limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces. I correctly identified that Togowa is limited to spaces #1 or #2, but I failed to recognize that this also limits Young to spaces #2 or #3 (since Young must have a higher number than Togowa). Similarly, since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this limits Robertson to spaces #3 or #4. I didn't fully think through the implications of each rule on the other employees' possible assignments.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider implications
 - Miscounting
 - Overlooking constraints
Solution:
1. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. This means Robertson cannot be assigned #5 or #6.
2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3.
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.
5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.
6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
7. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #3 or #4 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
   - Souza: no specific limitation 
   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation
   - Young: must be assigned #2 or #3 (limited to [REDACTED] spaces)
8. Counting the employees with assignments limited to only [REDACTED] spaces:
   - Togowa, Young, Robertson are each limited to [REDACTED] specific spaces
   - Souza, Vaughn, Xu have no such limitation
Therefore, [REDACTED] employees (Togowa, Young, Robertson, and Vaughn) have their assignment limited to only [REDACTED] possible spaces.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and note all the assignment rules.
2. Consider each employee individually and determine their possible parking spaces based on the rules.
3. If an employee's possible spaces are limited, see if this has implications for limiting other employees' spaces further.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until no further limitations can be inferred.
5. Make a final list of each employee and their possible spaces.
6. Count the number of employees whose possible spaces are limited to exactly [REDACTED].
7. Select the answer choice that matches this count.
Advice:
 - Always read the constraints and rules carefully.
 - Consider the implications of each rule - how it affects the possibilities for each individual.
 - Recognize that constraints on one individual can lead to further constraints on others.
 - Be thorough in working through the implications of each rule until no further inferences can be made.
 - Organize your final results clearly before answering the question.
 - Double-check your work if time allows.
