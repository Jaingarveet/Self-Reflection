Explanation:
I made an error in interpreting the conditions of the problem. Specifically, I misread the condition about Olivia and Robert not being able to give afternoon reports as them not being able to give morning reports. This led me to incorrectly eliminate choice [REDACTED] and select choice [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading problem conditions
 - Misinterpreting problem constraints
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, this time being careful to correctly interpret the problem conditions:
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Here, Nina gives a report on Wednesday morning, but Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday. 
[REDACTED]: Satisfies all conditions. George gives a report on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert give morning reports. If Nina had given a report, it would have had to be on Monday or Tuesday for Helen and Irving to both report the next day, but Nina is not reporting at all in this schedule.
[REDACTED]: Violates the condition that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
[REDACTED]: Violates the conditions that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
Therefore, the only schedule that satisfies all the conditions is choice [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and list out all the conditions/constraints.
2. Go through each answer choice one by one.
3. For each choice, check if it violates any of the listed conditions.
4. If a choice violates a condition, eliminate it and move to the next choice.
5. If a choice satisfies all conditions, select it as the correct answer.
6. Double-check that the selected answer indeed satisfies all conditions.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem statement and answer choices carefully.
 - Always list out all the given conditions and constraints explicitly.
 - Always consider each constraint for each answer choice; don't skip any.
 - Never make assumptions; only use the information given in the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and selected answer against the conditions.
 - If the problem involves scheduling or sequencing, consider using a diagram or table to organize the information and constraints.
