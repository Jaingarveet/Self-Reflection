Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice [REDACTED] was possible and choice [REDACTED] was impossible. I failed to properly apply the constraint that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected. With choice [REDACTED], selecting both French plays would preclude selecting the one play mentioned.
Error Keywords:
 - Misapplied constraints
 - Overlooked problem conditions
 - Faulty logical reasoning
 - Incomplete analysis of choices
Solution:
Let's re-examine each choice carefully, ensuring all constraints are satisfied:
[REDACTED]. No Russian novels and exactly one play: This is not possible. If no Russian novels are selected, then all 3 French novels must be selected to have at least 3 novels. But then selecting 1 play would require selecting 4 French works, violating the limit of no more than 4 French works.
[REDACTED]. Exactly one Russian novel and both French plays: This is possible. We can select 1 Russian novel, 2 French novels, and both French plays, satisfying all constraints.
[REDACTED]. Exactly two French novels and the Russian play: This is possible, as previously determined.
[REDACTED]. Exactly two French novels and exactly two plays: This is possible, as previously determined. 
[REDACTED]. Exactly two Russian novels and exactly one play: This is possible, as previously determined.
Therefore, the only choice that cannot be true is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all problem constraints.
2. Analyze each answer choice individually.
3. For each choice, mentally select the works described.
4. Check if the selection violates any of the given constraints.
5. If a violation is found, eliminate that choice as a possibility.
6. If no violations are found, keep that choice as a possibility.
7. The choice that cannot be true will violate at least one constraint.
Advice:
 - Always fully grasp the problem conditions before attempting a solution.
 - Consider each constraint separately and in combination.
 - Systematically evaluate each answer choice against all constraints.
 - Be thorough in your analysis; don't make assumptions.
 - If a choice seems impossible, double-check your reasoning.
 - Eliminate choices through the process of contradiction.
 - The one choice that cannot be true will be the correct answer in an EXCEPT question.
