Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer [REDACTED] because I thought the contrapositive of the original statement would have the same logical effect. However, the original statement does not preclude the possibility of Kayne being assigned without Jaramillo. The correct answer, [REDACTED], captures the full meaning of the original constraint by preventing Jaramillo from being assigned unless Kayne is also assigned.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical equivalence error
 - Contrapositive error
 - Implication error
 - Constraint interpretation error
Solution:
The original constraint states: "If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne." 
This means that Jaramillo cannot be assigned unless Kayne is also assigned. However, it does not preclude Kayne from being assigned without Jaramillo.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) "If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo" is the contrapositive, but it changes the meaning. It would force Jaramillo to be assigned whenever Kayne is, which is not the same as the original constraint.
B) "If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke" is irrelevant to the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne.
C) "If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship" is also irrelevant to the original constraint.
D) "Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships" captures the essence of the original constraint. If Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be assigned because Kayne must be. This has the same effect as the original.
E) "Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships" is once again irrelevant to the original constraint.
Therefore, [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the original constraint and understand its full implications.
2. For each answer choice, determine if it is logically equivalent to the original constraint.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to the original constraint.
4. Eliminate answer choices that change the meaning of the original constraint.
5. Select the answer choice that captures the full meaning and effect of the original constraint.
Advice:
 - Always read constraints carefully and consider their full logical implications.
 - Be wary of contrapositives - they are not always logically equivalent in meaning.
 - Eliminate irrelevant answer choices first.
 - Always consider how each answer choice relates to and affects the original constraint.
 - Select the answer that most fully captures the meaning and effect of the original, without adding or removing implications.
