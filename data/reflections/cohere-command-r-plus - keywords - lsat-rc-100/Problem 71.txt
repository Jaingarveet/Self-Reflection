Solution: The author of Passage [REDACTED] criticizes the assumption that evolutionary psychology makes, which is to explain human behavior solely from the perspective of genetic self-propagation. They argue that this reduces complex human behavior to a single motive, ignoring the possibility of multiple interests and motives. 

Passage [REDACTED] makes the argument that altruistic behavior can be explained by evolutionary psychology, suggesting that it contributes to the propagation of genes for identification and empathy. However, the author of Passage [REDACTED] would see this as an oversimplification. They would argue that altruism could be motivated by other factors, such as an inherent interest in the welfare of others, and that it is rare for a single interest to decisively explain a behavior. 

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

**Choice C**: "[REDACTED]" 

This choice captures the mistaken assumption that Passage [REDACTED] criticizes, which is the simplistic application of evolutionary theory to explain complex human behavior.
