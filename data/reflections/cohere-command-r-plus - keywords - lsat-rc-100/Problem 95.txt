Solution: The correct answer is Option [REDACTED]. The first two paragraphs describe a scenario where the digitization of books and on-demand printing at the point of sale eliminate the need for physical inventory and traditional warehousing practices. Option [REDACTED] reflects this change, stating that the need for warehousing will shift from individual books to the materials used to create them, such as paper and binding materials. This is a direct consequence of the new publishing model described in the passage.
