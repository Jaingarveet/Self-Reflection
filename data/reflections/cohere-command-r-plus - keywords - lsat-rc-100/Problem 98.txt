Solution: The author suggests that the two strategies for deterring deliberate crimes are not mutually exclusive and that an optimal approach combines elements from both. The economic principle of utility maximization states that individuals will choose actions that maximize their expected utility, weighing the potential benefits and costs of different options. 

Statement [REDACTED]: The author agrees that stricter punishments for repeat offenders increase the expected cost of criminal activity, making it less attractive, and thus supporting a decrease in recidivism. 

Statement [REDACTED]: Ending rehabilitation efforts removes a potential source of increased expected utility for lawful activity, which could lead to an increase in criminal activity, as suggested. 

Statement [REDACTED]: Incorrect interpretation. Increasing the expected utility of lawful activities makes unlawful activities less attractive, thus decreasing the rate of deliberate crimes. This is the inverse relationship I missed. 

Statement [REDACTED]: Restricting access to economic institutions decreases the expected utility of lawful activity, making unlawful activities relatively more attractive, and leading to a potential increase in deliberate crimes, as the author suggests. 

Statement [REDACTED]: The correct answer. The author suggests that stronger law enforcement decreases the expected utility of criminal activity, making it less attractive, and thus should lead to a decrease, not an increase, in deliberate crimes.
