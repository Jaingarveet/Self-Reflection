Solution: The passage introduces three distinct positions in Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's era:
1. Art is separate from everyday life.
2. Art should be grounded in concrete reality and serve a political view.
3. Dostoyevsky's view: Reality is shaped by individual experience, blending fantasy and the tangible. Art should prioritize artistic merit over utility.

The structure of the passage presents each position and then focuses on differentiating Dostoyevsky's perspective (the third position) from the second position, which is the radical view. It emphasizes how Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and art differs from the radical critics' insistence on the tangible and their belief in art's utility.
