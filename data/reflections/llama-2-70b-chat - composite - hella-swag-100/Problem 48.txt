Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. After reevaluating the question and the options, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect.

The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

This option aligns with the text's suggestion to consider the intended use of the speakers and provides a more comprehensive solution for readers who want a more immersive experience.

Option [REDACTED] is not relevant to the topic, and option [REDACTED] is not a practical suggestion for most readers. Option [REDACTED] extends the idea of considering the intended use of the speakers but does not provide the most coherent and helpful advice for readers.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this corrected answer will help readers better understand the topic.
