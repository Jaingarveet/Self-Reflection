Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I misunderstood the instructions and did not provide my answer in the correct format.

The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

The step mentioned in the question is about soaking the eggplant slices in salted water. The purpose of this step is to remove excess moisture from the eggplant, which will help the fritters to hold their shape better when fried. After soaking, it is important to drain the eggplant slices and remove excess liquid before proceeding with the recipe. Option [REDACTED] suggests draining the eggplant after 10 minutes and setting it aside for later use, which is the correct next step in the recipe.

I hope this clears up any confusion, and I apologize again for the mistake in my previous response.
