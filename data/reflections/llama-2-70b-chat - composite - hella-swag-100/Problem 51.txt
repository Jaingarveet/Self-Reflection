Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made an incorrect assumption about the context of the situation.
I thought the boys were practicing a drill or exercise, and therefore, the next step would be for them to start a new drill or continue playing the game.
However, the correct answer is that the boys form a huddle and begin talking.
This suggests that the drill was possibly a team-building exercise, and the boys are now discussing strategy or receiving feedback from their coach.
Error Keywords:
