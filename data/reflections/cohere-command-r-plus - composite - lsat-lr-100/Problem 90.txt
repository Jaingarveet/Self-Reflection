Solution: The science journalist's statements are about the classification of celestial objects based on their mass and the presence or absence of lithium in their atmospheres. 

Brown dwarfs are defined by having more mass than planets but less mass than stars, and they lack fully functional nuclear furnaces, which means their lithium is not consumed. 

Choice [REDACTED] states, "[REDACTED]" This is supported by the journalist's explanation that brown dwarfs are distinguished by their mass range and the presence of lithium, as their nuclear furnaces are not active enough to consume it. If an object has no lithium, it cannot be a brown dwarf because brown dwarfs are the only category of objects expected to retain lithium. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the context: The journalist is explaining the characteristics of brown dwarfs and how they differ from stars and planets in terms of mass and lithium presence. 
2. Interpret the information: Lithium is a key indicator of the functionality of a celestial object's nuclear furnace, which is directly related to its mass. 
3. Evaluate each choice: 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because the absence of lithium could be due to other factors, such as the object being a brown dwarf or having a different formation history. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because stars more massive than the Sun also have lithium, but their elements are thoroughly mixed due to higher temperatures and pressures. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is correct because it captures the key distinction; only brown dwarfs are expected to retain lithium, so the absence of lithium means an object is not a brown dwarf. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect as it is overly broad and misleading. While brown dwarfs with lithium do have less mass than the Sun, other objects with lithium may fall into different categories. 
    - Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because it focuses solely on the mass of the object, ignoring the critical role of lithium presence in distinguishing brown dwarfs. 
4. Choose the best answer: Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer as it is the most accurate and specific inference supported by the journalist's statements. 

Advice:
 - Consider all information provided and how it relates to the question. 
 - Understand the underlying principles and connections between the provided facts. 
 - Avoid overinterpreting or focusing too narrowly on certain aspects while ignoring others. 
 - Evaluate each choice critically, considering both its accuracy and its scope. 
 - Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the provided information, avoiding broad or misleading statements.
