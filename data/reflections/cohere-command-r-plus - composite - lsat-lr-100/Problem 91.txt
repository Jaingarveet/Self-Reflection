Explanation:
I misinterpreted the main point of the passage and focused on the idea that not all allergy sufferers will react to every cat. However, the key point is the variation in proteins across cats, which directly supports statement [REDACTED]. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overgeneralization
- Ignoring specific details

Solution:
The context discusses the presence of specific proteins in cat skin secretions and saliva, which vary across individual cats. This directly supports statement [REDACTED], as it highlights the non-identical nature of cats' biological makeup regarding allergy-causing proteins. 

Instructions:
1. Focus on the specific details provided in the context. 
2. Identify the central point of the context, which is the variation in proteins across cats. 
3. Evaluate each statement based on this central point. 
4. Choose the statement that is most strongly and directly supported by the provided information. 

Advice:
- Avoid making broad generalizations; focus on the specific details presented. 
- Identify the key variables and how they relate to each other.
