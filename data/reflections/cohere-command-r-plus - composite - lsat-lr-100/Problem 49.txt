Explanation:
I misinterpreted the argument's focus on the role of third-party deception in habit-breaking. 
I overlooked the key assumption that individuals cannot easily deceive themselves and require external deception to facilitate behavior change. 
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Omission error
- Deception assumption error
Solution:
The argument discusses the challenge of breaking habits and the potential effectiveness of exaggerated warnings delivered by doctors or third parties. 
Choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because the argument assumes that individuals cannot easily deceive themselves to break habits. 
This assumption is critical to the argument's conclusion that external deception by a doctor or third party is necessary for habit change.
Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's conclusion: Exaggerated warnings from doctors can help smokers quit.
2. Determine the supporting evidence: Similar strategies involving deception can break habits.
3. Recognize the gap: Individuals cannot easily employ such strategies themselves.
4. Analyze the role of the third party: They provide external deception, filling the gap.
5. Understand the key assumption: People generally cannot deceive themselves to break habits.
6. Evaluate each choice: Only Choice [REDACTED] aligns with the identified assumption.
Advice:
- Carefully identify the argument's conclusion and underlying assumptions.
- Recognize the role of third parties in providing external deception.
- Focus on the challenge of self-deception and the need for external influence.
- Evaluate each choice critically, ensuring it aligns with the identified assumption.
- Avoid surface-level interpretations and look for deeper, underlying assumptions.
