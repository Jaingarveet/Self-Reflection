Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Lack of attention to detail
- Overlooking context

Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the understanding that any behavior required by national codes, such as building standards, should also be reflected in local codes. This ensures consistency and means that ignorance of the distinction between the two cannot be used as an excuse. Therefore, the correct answer is: 

**[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**

Instructions:
1. Focus on the judge's statement about the defendant's charge: "since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes."
2. Understand the context: the defendant is arguing that they were unsure which codes applied, national or local.
3. Recognize the key principle: the relationship between national and local codes and how they apply to charges of noncompliance.
4. Identify the answer choice that reflects this relationship: national code requirements are also required by local codes.
5. Avoid the trap of focusing solely on the defendant's ignorance, which is a red herring in this case.

Advice:
- Read and understand the context thoroughly, paying attention to key phrases and the charges involved. 
- Recognize potential red herrings or misleading details that might steer you toward an incorrect answer. 
- Focus on the underlying principles and relationships rather than superficial similarities between answer choices and the problem. 
- Ensure your interpretation of the judge's reasoning aligns with the specific charges and context provided.
