Solution:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: [REDACTED]0 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.[REDACTED]) and solve for n.
Solving this equation gives n = [REDACTED].
