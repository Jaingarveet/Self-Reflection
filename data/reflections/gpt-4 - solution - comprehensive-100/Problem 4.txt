Solution:
The space shuttle's maximum speed is 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. 
If it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, then the length of the shuttle is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m. 
The correct answer is not in the choices because I made a calculation error. The correct calculation is 17.5 m/s * 5s = 87.5 m, which rounds to 88 m. The closest value to 88 m is [REDACTED].
