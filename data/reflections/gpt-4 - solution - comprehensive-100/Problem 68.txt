Solution:
[REDACTED] line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). If this line passes through the origin, then the slope must be the same when x=[REDACTED]. So, we need to solve the equation (32-k)/(k-2) = k/2. Solving this equation gives k = [REDACTED].
