Solution:
Given the constraints, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The shoe store is in space 2, so the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 because it would not be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so a restaurant cannot be in space 3. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 4, the toy store cannot be in space 6. Therefore, the only possible option is that the optometrist is in space 5.
