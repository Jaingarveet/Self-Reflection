Solution:
Given that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, and George can only report on Tuesday, this means that Nina and Robert must report on Monday and Wednesday. However, since Nina's report requires Helen and Irving to report the next day (unless Nina reports on Wednesday), Nina can report on Monday, and Helen and Irving can report on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
