Solution:
Given that G is on the top shelf, and K must be on a higher shelf than F, K must also be on the top shelf. Since F and M are on the same shelf and K is on a higher shelf than F, F and M cannot be on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf. Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and we already have two books (G and K) on the top shelf, we can only have two books on the middle shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf. I is on the middle shelf, and since O must be on a higher shelf than L, L must also be on the middle shelf. Therefore, the books on the middle shelf are [REDACTED], and possibly others.
