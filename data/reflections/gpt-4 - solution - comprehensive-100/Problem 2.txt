Solution:
The length of the fence is composed of the width of the pickets and the space between them. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, and since there are (x-1) spaces between x pickets, the total space between the pickets is 6(x-1) inches. So, the total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1). To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). First, simplify the equation: 1/2x + 6(x-1) = 1/2x + 6x - 6 = 6.5x - 6. Then, convert to feet by dividing by 12: (6.5x - 6) / 12 = [REDACTED]4 - 1/2 = (13x - 12) / 24. So, the answer is [REDACTED]: (13x - 12) / 24.
