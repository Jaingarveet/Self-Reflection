Solution:
Given the conditions, we know that:
1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they can only report in the morning.
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we need to find a sequence that fits these conditions. 
Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This works because George gives a report on Tuesday afternoon, and neither Olivia nor Robert give an afternoon report. Also, Nina doesn't give a report, so the condition about Helen and Irving doesn't apply.
