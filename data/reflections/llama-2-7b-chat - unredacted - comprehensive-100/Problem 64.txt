  Explanation:

The correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

The engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now can be represented by a linear decay function, as the population is expected to decrease by 10% every 20 years. This means that the population will decrease at a constant rate, which can be represented by the formula:

Population ($t$ years from now) = Population present ($50,000$) x (1 - 0.10^t)

Where t is the number of years from the present.

So, the correct answer is (D) $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

Error Keywords:

* Linear decay function
* Constant rate of change
* Population growth model

Instructions:

1. Identify the pattern in the engineer's estimate of the population of the city $t$ years from now.
2. Choose the correct formula to represent the population growth model.
3. Plug in the value of t (20 years from the present) to find the estimated population.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the population growth model can be represented by different formulas, such as linear decay functions or exponential functions, depending on the specific pattern of growth.
