 Explanation:
The correct answer is (B) If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The statement "friends are worth a thousand dollars" is a metaphorical expression, and it does not necessarily mean that friends have a monetary value.
2. If we assume that friends are indeed worth a lot of money, then we can logically deduce that money is not like dung.
3. This is because if friends are worth a lot of money, then money must have some value or worth beyond just being something used for exchanging goods and services.
4. Therefore, the conclusion that money is not like dung follows logically from the premise that friends are worth a lot of money.

The other options do not lead to the correct conclusion:

Option (A) is false because the expression "money is like dung" is not necessarily false. Even if we assume that it is false, it does not lead to the conclusion that friends are worth a lot of money.

Option (C) is true, but it does not logically follow from the premises. The statement "friends are valuable" is a separate statement that does not necessarily imply that money is not like dung.

Option (D) is also false because the words "Money is like dung" and "Friends are worth a thousand dollars" are not necessarily true or false. They are metaphorical expressions that may or may not have any literal meaning.
