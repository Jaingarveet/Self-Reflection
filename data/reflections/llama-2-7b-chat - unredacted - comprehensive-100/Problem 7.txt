 Explanation:
You are correct! The weight of the heavy-duty truck is 44.8 tons, which is answer choice E.

Here's how you can arrive at this answer:

The average weight of the group of vehicles before the new truck was added is 12.2 tons.
The average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons after the new truck was added.

So, the weight of the heavy-duty truck can be calculated using the formula for the arithmetic mean:

Arithmetic mean = (x1 + x2 + ... + xn) / n

where x1, x2, ..., xn are the values of the variables we are averaging, and n is the number of values.

In this case, the values are the weights of the 10 vehicles, which are given as 12.2 tons. So, we can plug this value into the formula:

Arithmetic mean = (12.2 + 12.2 + ... + 12.2) / 10

Simplifying the formula, we get:

Arithmetic mean = 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons

Therefore, the weight of the heavy-duty truck is 44.8 tons, which is answer choice E.

Great job!
