  Great, let's break down the passage and analyze why the correct answer is (D) Exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges.

The passage states that the mental athletes were able to memorize information because they were consciously converting it into images and distributing them along familiar spatial journeys. This suggests that they were using mental strategies to aid memorization, rather than relying solely on automatic processes.

The researchers found that the brains of mental athletes were activating entirely different circuitry when memorizing compared to control subjects. This difference was attributed to their training and practice, which suggests that the mental athletes had developed new neural pathways and patterns of activity through their mental exercises.

Therefore, the passage suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges, which helps them develop new neural pathways and patterns of activity that aid memorization.

Option (A) exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization is not supported by the passage, as it does not mention anything about exploiting specific brain regions.

Option (B) convert information they are trying to memorize into abstract symbols is also not supported by the passage, as the mental athletes reported consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, not abstract symbols.

Option (C) organize information into numerical lists prior to memorization is mentioned in the passage, but it is not the main reason why mental athletes are successful at memorization. The passage states that the mental athletes were consciously converting the information they were being asked to memorize into images, rather than organizing it into numerical lists.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Exercise their brains regularly through puzzles and other mental challenges.
