Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before answering.
* Always decompose complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the power of a number is the result of raising it to that power, not the result of adding it to itself.
