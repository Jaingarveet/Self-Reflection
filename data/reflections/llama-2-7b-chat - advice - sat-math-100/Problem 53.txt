Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the slope of a line is a ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change, so it tells you how much the line moves for every $1$ unit of horizontal movement.
