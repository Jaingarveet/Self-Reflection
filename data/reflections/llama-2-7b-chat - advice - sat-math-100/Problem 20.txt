Advice:

* Always check your calculations and ensure that they are correct.
* When solving a system of equations, it is important to isolate each variable separately and then substitute the solutions into the other equation.
* When solving for $x$, always divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of $x$.
* When solving for $y$, always divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of $y$.
* Always check your work by plugging in the values of $x$ and $y$ into one of the equations and verifying that the result is true.
