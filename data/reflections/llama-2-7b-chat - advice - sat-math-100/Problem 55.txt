Advice:

* Always identify the equation of the parabola and determine its stationary points.
* Use the derivative of the function to find the stationary points.
* Determine the minimum or maximum value of the parabola by finding the minimum or maximum value of the function.
* Always check your calculations to ensure that you have found the correct minimum or maximum value of the parabola.
* Remember that the minimum or maximum value of the parabola is the value of $y$ that corresponds to the minimum or maximum value of the function.
