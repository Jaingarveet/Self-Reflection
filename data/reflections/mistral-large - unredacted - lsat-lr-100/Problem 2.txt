Solution:
The statements given tell us that only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival, and that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
We cannot infer that most of the Canadian films that were shown at international film festivals won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival (A), as we don't know how many Canadian films were shown at international film festivals.
We cannot infer that most of the Canadian films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival (B), as we don't know how many Canadian films were produced this year.
We can infer that some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films (C), as we know that most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals, and only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
We can infer that this year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival (D), as we don't know if all the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival were shown at international film festivals.
We cannot infer that this year, at least one film that won a prize at an international film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival (E), as we don't know if all the films that won prizes at international film festivals were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
