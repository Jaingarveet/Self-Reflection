Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the pattern of flawed reasoning in the original argument and failed to recognize the similar pattern in choice E.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.
I misunderstood the flawed reasoning in the original argument and incorrectly identified the pattern in choice B as most similar.

Error Keywords:
 - Logical fallacy
 - Undistributed middle
 - Misunderstanding
 - Incorrect identification

Solution:
The original argument assumes that all auto mechanics have extensive experience and that all mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. However, this does not necessarily mean that all auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is an example of the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.
Choice E assumes that all snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer and that all companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. However, this does not necessarily mean that all snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. This is also an example of the logical fallacy of undistributed middle.

Instructions:
1. Identify the logical fallacy in the original argument.
2. Compare the pattern of flawed reasoning in each choice to the original argument.
3. Identify the choice that has the most similar pattern of flawed reasoning to the original argument.
4. Double-check your understanding of the logical fallacy in the original argument and the choice you have identified as most similar.
5. Choose the answer that matches your identified choice.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the logical fallacy in the original argument.
 - Always compare the pattern of flawed reasoning in each choice to the original argument.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the logical fallacy in the original argument and the choice you have identified as most similar.
 - Remember that the logical fallacy of undistributed middle occurs when a term is not distributed in either or both of the premises but is distributed in the conclusion.
