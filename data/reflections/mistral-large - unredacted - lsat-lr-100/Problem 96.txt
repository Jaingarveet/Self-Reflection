Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the fact that high traffic volume can lead to slower speeds, which in turn can reduce the severity of accidents.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in traffic safety.
I failed to consider the relationship between traffic volume and speed.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Lack of consideration
 - Traffic safety
Solution:
The question asks for an explanation of why highways with the most traffic have the lowest rate of fatal accidents.
Choice A is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
Choice B contradicts the information given in the question.
Choice C suggests that commuters may be more experienced drivers or that they drive more cautiously due to familiarity with the route, but it does not explain why heavily traveled highways have lower rates of fatal accidents.
Choice D suggests that high traffic volume can lead to slower speeds, which in turn can reduce the severity of accidents.
Choice E is not relevant to the phenomenon described.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the phenomenon that needs to be explained.
2. Consider the relationship between traffic volume and speed.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in light of this relationship.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not relevant to the phenomenon described.
5. Choose the answer that best explains the phenomenon.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the relationship between different factors.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice in light of this relationship.
 - Never make assumptions without considering all possible factors.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure that it explains the phenomenon described.
