Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the ethicist's argument about feelings and control, rather than the logical assumption required for the conclusion to follow.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the subject matter but in understanding the logical structure of the argument.
I knew the ethicist's conclusion but misidentified the assumption required for it to follow logically.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Assumption identification error
 - Argument structure error
Solution:
The ethicist's conclusion is that "love" in the context of marital vows should not be taken to refer to feelings.
The ethicist's argument is that feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense.
For this conclusion to follow logically, it must be assumed that promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
Instructions:
1. Identify the ethicist's conclusion.
2. Identify the ethicist's argument.
3. Identify the assumption required for the conclusion to follow logically from the argument.
4. Work step-by-step through the logical structure of the argument.
5. Double-check your understanding of the argument and the assumption required for the conclusion to follow.
6. Choose the answer that matches the assumption required for the conclusion to follow logically.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conclusion, argument, and assumption in a logical argument.
 - Always think through the logical structure of the argument step-by-step.
 - Never focus solely on the subject matter of the argument; consider its logical structure.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the argument and the assumption required for the conclusion to follow.
 - Remember that the assumption required for a conclusion to follow logically may not be explicitly stated in the argument.
