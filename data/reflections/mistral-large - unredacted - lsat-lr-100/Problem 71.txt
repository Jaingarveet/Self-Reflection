Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the wrong aspect of the curator's statements. I focused on the fact that the museum store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection, which are all twentieth-century works, and that the store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. However, I failed to consider the fact that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.

Solution:
The curator's statements indicate that the museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. Therefore, there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
