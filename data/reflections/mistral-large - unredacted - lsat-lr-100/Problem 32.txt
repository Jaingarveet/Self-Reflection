Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the inconsistency of the political party's views rather than the assumption underlying the argument in the editorial.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Focusing on the wrong aspect of the argument
 - Failing to identify the underlying assumption

Solution:
The argument in the editorial assumes that a consistent political policy cannot hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
The editorial argues that the political party's policy is inconsistent because it expresses the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal but also claims that the government should not increase spending on education.
The assumption underlying the argument is that a consistent political policy cannot hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.

Instructions:
1. Identify the argument in the editorial.
2. Determine the assumption underlying the argument.
3. Evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption underlying the argument.
4. Choose the answer that best represents the assumption underlying the argument.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the argument and the assumption underlying the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption underlying the argument.
 - Never focus on the wrong aspect of the argument.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the assumption underlying the argument is often not explicitly stated in the argument itself.
