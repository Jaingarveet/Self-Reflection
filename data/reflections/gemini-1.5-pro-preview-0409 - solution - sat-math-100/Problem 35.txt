Solution:
1. **Solve for $x$ by squaring both sides:**
$(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
$4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
$0 = x^2 - 10x + 9$
$0 = (x-1)(x-9)$
Therefore, $x=1$ or $x=9$.
2. **Check for extraneous solutions:**
- For $x=1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 2$, but $1-3 = -2$. So, $x=1$ is not a valid solution.
- For $x=9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 6$, and $9-3 = 6$. So, $x=9$ is a valid solution.
