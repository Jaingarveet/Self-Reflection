- Pay close attention to the properties of the components and whether they remain distinct or chemically react to form a new substance.
- When analyzing mixtures, focus on the physical combination of components rather than any chemical changes.
- If unsure, double-check the definitions and characteristics of mixtures and compounds before making a final decision.
