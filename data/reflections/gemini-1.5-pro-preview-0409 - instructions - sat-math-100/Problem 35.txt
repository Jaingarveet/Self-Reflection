Instructions:
1. Solve the equation algebraically, keeping in mind that squaring both sides might introduce extraneous solutions.
2. Once you have potential solutions, substitute each one back into the original equation.
3. Verify if the equation holds true for each potential solution.
4. Discard any solution that does not satisfy the original equation.
5. Select the answer choice that includes only the valid solutions.
