Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients a, b, and c in the quadratic equation.
2. Substitute these values into the quadratic formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$.
3. Calculate the discriminant (bÂ²-4ac) carefully.
4. Simplify the expression under the square root.
5. Simplify the entire expression to find the solutions.
