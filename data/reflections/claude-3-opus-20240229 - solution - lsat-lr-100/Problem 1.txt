Solution:
1. The question states that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees.
2. Cacti grow well in dry (not humid) climates, while orange trees grow well in warm (not cold) climates.
3. If half the country is both humid and cold, it would be unsuitable for both cacti and orange trees.
4. However, the other half of the country could still be suitable for either cacti (if dry) or orange trees (if warm).
5. Therefore, statement [REDACTED] can be true while still being consistent with the given information.
6. Statements [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are all consistent with the given information and cannot be definitively false.
7. Since statement [REDACTED] is the only one that can be false, it must be false.
