Solution:
The study found that smokers of both low and high-nicotine cigarettes have the same blood nicotine levels after smoking a pack a day. To explain this, we need to find a choice that accounts for why high-nicotine cigarette smokers don't have higher blood nicotine levels.
Choice [REDACTED] states that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than the amount found in a pack of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. This means there is a maximum daily limit of nicotine absorption, and even low-nicotine cigarettes reach this limit when a pack is smoked. Therefore, high-nicotine smokers can't absorb any extra nicotine beyond this daily maximum, explaining why they have the same blood nicotine levels as low-nicotine smokers after a pack.
The other choices do not fully explain the finding. While [REDACTED] suggests low-nicotine smokers may compensate by smoking more, it doesn't account for the hard limit on daily nicotine absorption. Choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not directly relevant to explaining the observation.
