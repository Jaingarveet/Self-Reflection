Solution:
Given:
1. Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
2. This year, most of the films that won prizes at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival also won prizes at international film festivals.
Analyzing the answer choices:
[REDACTED]: Not necessarily true. The information is about Lac Nichoutec prize-winners, not all Canadian films at international festivals.
[REDACTED]: Not necessarily true. The information doesn't indicate the proportion of Canadian films shown at Lac Nichoutec.
[REDACTED]: Could be true, but not necessarily. If even one international prize-winner was not Canadian, this would be false.
[REDACTED]: Must be true. If most (but not all) Lac Nichoutec winners won internationally, then at least one Lac Nichoutec winner must not have won internationally.
[REDACTED]: Not necessarily true. It's possible that all international prize-winners were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
Therefore, [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
