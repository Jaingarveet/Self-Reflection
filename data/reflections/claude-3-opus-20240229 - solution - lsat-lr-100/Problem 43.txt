Solution:
1. The argument states that if "love" in wedding vows refers to a feeling, the promise makes no sense.
2. This is because feelings are outside one's control, and promising something outside one's control is nonsensical.
3. The conclusion is that "love" in this context should not be taken to refer to feelings.
4. For this conclusion to follow, we must assume that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes them nonsensical.
5. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
