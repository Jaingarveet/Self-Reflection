Solution:
The argument concludes that technological innovation rarely serves society's interests because those responsible for it are motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit. The key flaw is that it assumes that because the innovators are not primarily motivated by benefiting society, their innovations are unlikely to benefit society. 
However, as [REDACTED] points out, this assumes that an action is unlikely to produce an outcome unless the actor desires that outcome. In reality, actions can have unintended positive consequences regardless of the actor's motivations. An innovator primarily seeking profit could still end up creating something that greatly benefits society. The argument fails to consider this possibility.
