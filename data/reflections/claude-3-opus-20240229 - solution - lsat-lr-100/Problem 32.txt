Solution:
1. The editorial states that the political party's policy is inconsistent because:
   a) They say increasing education spending is a worthy goal.
   b) They also say the government should not increase education spending.
2. The editorial assumes that a consistent policy would not simultaneously claim a goal is worthy but should not be pursued.
3. Answer choice [REDACTED] states: "[REDACTED] consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed." This matches the editorial's underlying assumption.
4. The other answer choices do not accurately capture the assumption the editorial relies on.
5. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
