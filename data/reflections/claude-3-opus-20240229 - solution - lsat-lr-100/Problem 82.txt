Solution:
Patricia's main claim is that there was little ninja activity during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time. 
Tamara objects by pointing out that many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed to warn of ninjas, suggesting they did fear ninjas.
However, the wealthy made up only a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period (Choice C). 
So even if the wealthy feared ninjas, this is consistent with Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not.
The prevalence of fear among a small subgroup does not contradict the assertion about the population as a whole.
