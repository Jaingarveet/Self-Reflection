Solution:
The argument notes that human tears contain many of the same hormones that the body produces during emotional stress. It then asserts that because shedding tears removes these hormones from the body, crying must reduce emotional stress.
However, the argument assumes that because stress hormones are present in tears, those hormones must be a cause of emotional stress. This is a flawed assumption. The mere presence of these hormones in tears when stress occurs does not necessarily mean that the hormones themselves cause the stress.

The argument fails to consider this possibility and simply takes for granted that the presence of the hormones in tears means they are a cause of stress.
Therefore, the reasoning is most vulnerable to the criticism that it [REDACTED].
