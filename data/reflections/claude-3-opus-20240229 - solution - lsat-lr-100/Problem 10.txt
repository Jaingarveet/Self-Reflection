Solution:
1. Mike is justifying using Tom's computer without permission by pointing out that Tom used Mary's bicycle without her permission.
2. The key principle Mike is applying is that it's permissible to treat people the same way they have treated others. 
3. This is a general principle that extends beyond just cases of using others' property.
4. Choice (D) directly captures this general principle - it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
5. While choice (C) fits the specific property example, it is too narrow. Mike's reasoning relies on a broader principle of reciprocity.
6. Choices (A), (B), and (E) are not relevant to the key principle Mike is using to justify his actions.
Therefore, the principle that would most justify Mike's reasoning is (D) - it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others.
