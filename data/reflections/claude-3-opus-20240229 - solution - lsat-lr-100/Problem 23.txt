Solution:
The teacher's argument can be broken down as follows:
1. Participating in competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. 
2. Critics argue that athletics can also make less developed children feel inferior, a feeling that persists.
3. However, research shows that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful.
4. Therefore, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated.
The assertion that participating in athletics may increase strength and coordination is mentioned as one possible reason to support athletic programs. The teacher then suggests an additional reason to maintain funding (that feelings of inferiority can lead to later success), in order to counter the critics' argument. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] most accurately describes the role of the assertion in question.
