Solution:
Let's re-examine the curator's statements and break them down:
1. The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
2. The displayed works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
3. Prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store.
4. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Now, let's reconsider each choice:
[REDACTED]: False. The store sells prints of some works not in the museum's collection, like Nighthawks.
[REDACTED]: False. The store could sell prints of twentieth-century works that are neither on loan to the museum nor part of its permanent collection.
[REDACTED]: True. All works displayed in the museum that are not on loan from private collectors must be part of the museum's permanent collection. The store sells prints of all works in the permanent collection.
[REDACTED]: Insufficient information. We don't know if Nighthawks is on loan to the museum or from which century it is.
[REDACTED]: Insufficient information. We don't know if Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true based on the given information is [REDACTED].
