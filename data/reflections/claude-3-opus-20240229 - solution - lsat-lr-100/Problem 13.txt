Solution:
The economics professor's argument can be broken down as follows:
Premise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.
Premise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.
Premise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.
Conclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw the conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the premises to the conclusion. Choice [REDACTED] provides this connection by stating that any company refusing competitor coupons when doing so would satisfy potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. This assumption allows us to infer Checkers's motive based on the given premises.
