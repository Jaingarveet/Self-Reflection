Solution:
The original argument has the following structure:
1. If X (party's theories sound and implemented), then Y (inflation decreases)
2. Not Y (inflation increased)
3. Therefore, not X (party's theories flawed)
Let's compare this to argument [REDACTED]:
1. If X (company sold subsidiaries and bought patent), then Y (stock price doubles)
2. Not Y (stock price didn't increase)
3. Therefore, not X (company failed to sell subsidiaries)
Argument [REDACTED] follows the exact same reasoning pattern as the original argument, just with different specifics. The other arguments, while having some structural similarities, are not as directly analogous.
