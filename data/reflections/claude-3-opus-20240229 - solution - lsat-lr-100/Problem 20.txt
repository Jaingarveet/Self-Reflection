Solution:
The judge states that the defendant's excuse of confusion between national and local codes might be acceptable if he was charged with noncompliance with local codes. This implies that if the defendant had complied with the national codes, he would have necessarily also complied with the local codes.
In other words, the judge's reasoning relies on the principle that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. If this were not the case, then compliance with national codes would not necessarily guarantee compliance with local codes, and the defendant's excuse might be more acceptable.
Therefore, the principle that most helps to justify the judge's reasoning is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
