Solution:
The original argument concludes that most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits because:
1) Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. 
2) Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
The flaw is assuming the majority of the larger group (auto mechanics) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (mechanics with extensive experience).
Looking at argument [REDACTED]:
1) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services in summer.
2) Most lawn-care service companies hire additional workers in summer. 
3) The flawed conclusion is that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in summer.
This makes the same error of assuming the majority of the larger group (snow-removal companies) must have the trait held by the majority of a subset group (lawn-care service companies).
