Solution:
Since H does not participate, there are 4 spots left to fill.
Since E or F has one person to participate, but not both, we have two possibilities: E participates or F participates.
If E participates, then M can participate since F is not participating. But we still need two more players. Since J or K will participate, but not both, and if J participates, then G participates, we can choose J and G since there are still two spots left.
If F participates, then M must participate since F is participating. But we still need two more players. Since J or K will participate, but not both, and if J participates, then G participates, we cannot choose J since G cannot participate (all spots are filled). Therefore, K and G must participate.
In both cases, G must participate.
In the first case, E and G must participate.
In the second case, [REDACTED] must participate.
