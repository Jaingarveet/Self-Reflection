Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions given:

1. E or F has one person to participate, but not both.
2. One of J or K will participate, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G participates.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.

Now let's analyze the choices:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is possible, but we don't know if it's the only choice.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If J participates, G must participate. But we don't know if F or E is participating.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is not possible, as M can only participate if F participates, but G's participation requires J's participation, which contradicts the condition that F and E cannot participate together.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice is possible if F participates, as M can only participate if F participates.

Now let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If E participates, then F cannot participate. If J participates, then G must participate. But M cannot participate, as F is not participating. So the team would be E, J, G, and one of H or K.
2. If F participates, then E cannot participate. If K participates, then J cannot participate. But G can participate, as there is no condition that prevents it. So the team would be F, K, G, and one of H or M.

Based on the given conditions, the only possible choice for the two players that must be selected is:

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
