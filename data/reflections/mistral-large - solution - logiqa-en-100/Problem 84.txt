Solution:
The original argument follows the structure:
All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED].
We need to find an argument with a similar structure.

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
This argument follows the structure: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is [REDACTED]. This is not similar to the original argument.

Option [REDACTED]: Vegetables in Dongdun Market are very cheap. This basket of vegetables is not bought in Dongdun Market. Therefore, this basket of vegetables is not cheap.
This argument follows the structure: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]. This is similar to the original argument but not the most similar.

Option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
This argument follows the structure: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is [REDACTED]. This is not similar to the original argument.

Option [REDACTED]: Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan. Therefore, Sun Wen did not meet the basic conditions.
This argument follows the structure: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]. This is the most similar to the original argument.
