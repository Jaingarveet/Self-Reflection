Solution:
The change in the problem from "What should I do, what can I do to make money?" to "What can I do to be the best?" suggests a shift in focus from simply making money to becoming the best in the industry.
This shift in focus is likely due to increased competition and globalization brought about by joining the WTO, which would require companies to strive to be the best in order to succeed.
However, the most reasonable explanation for the change in the problem is not that becoming the best in the industry would lead to greater profits (Choice B), but rather that what used to be good or bad for the industry as a whole is now only good or bad for individual enterprises (Choice D).
