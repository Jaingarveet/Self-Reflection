Solution:
The given statement says that only companies with dividends can issue new stocks, but if a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.
Therefore, if a company needs financing, it cannot pay dividends.
Let's analyze each choice:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends.
This statement cannot be false because if a company has dividends, it does not need financing, and if a company needs financing, it cannot pay dividends.
Therefore, a listed company either does not need financing or is not a company with dividends.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends.
This statement can be false because a company can have dividends and not need financing.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends.
This statement can be false because a company can have dividends and still need to issue new stocks.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This statement can be false because a company can have financing needs and still not be able to issue new stocks if it does not have dividends.
