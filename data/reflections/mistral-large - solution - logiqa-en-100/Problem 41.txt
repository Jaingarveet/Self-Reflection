Solution:
The statement says that if Green Island increases productivity by 10%, it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%.
The contrapositive of this statement is that if Green Island cannot achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it cannot increase productivity by 10%.
Since the statement says that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years, otherwise it will go bankrupt, it follows that if Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
