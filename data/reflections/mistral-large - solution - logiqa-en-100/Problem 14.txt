Solution:
Given information:
1. The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
4. The human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since the human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department, the human resources department must be above the administration department.
2. The sales department cannot be adjacent to the human resources department, so it cannot be on the floor immediately above or below the human resources department.
3. The only option that satisfies these conditions is choice [REDACTED]: The sales department is one level above the administration department.
