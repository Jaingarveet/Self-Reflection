Solution:
If J is the fourth speaker, then J speaks after lunch.
Since G must speak before lunch, G cannot be the third speaker.
Since only one speaker is between M and N, M and N cannot both be in the first three speakers.
Since F speaks in the first or third place, F can be the third speaker.
However, if F is the first speaker, then M must be the second speaker, and N must be the third speaker.
Therefore, if J is the fourth speaker, then N must be the third speaker.
