Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions given:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W cannot be allocated in the production department.
4. F cannot be allocated in the production department.

Now let's analyze the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice does not meet condition 4, as F is allocated in the production department.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice does not meet condition 2, as F and G are in the same department.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice does not meet condition 2, as F and G are in the same department.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

* This choice meets all the conditions. H and Y are in the same department, F and G are not in the same department, X is in the sales department, so W cannot be in the production department, and F is not in the production department.
