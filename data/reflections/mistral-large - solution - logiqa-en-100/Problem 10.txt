Solution:
The researchers' views are that micro-shocks in the brain can improve the brain's computing power. The best support for this view would be evidence that the two groups of students were initially similar in their mathematics ability, as this would suggest that the improvement in the test group's ability was due to the micro-shocks and not some other factor.
