Solution:
The statement discusses the relationship between cost and profit, and how they are inversely related. The employees' wages are part of the cost, while the boss's profit is not included in the cost. Therefore, if the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, their interests would conflict with the boss's interests. The employee would want higher wages (higher cost), while the boss would want lower costs (higher profit).
