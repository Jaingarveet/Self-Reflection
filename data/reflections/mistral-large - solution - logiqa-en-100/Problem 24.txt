Solution:
The fallacy in this statistical reasoning is that it is based on a biased sample of intellectuals who died while in service, and it does not take into account the overall population of intellectuals in Zhongguancun.
The conclusion that the average age of death of intellectuals in Zhongguancun is lower than Beijing's average life expectancy is not valid because it is based on a biased sample.
