Solution:
The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
The finance department is next to the planning department.
The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.

Let's try to arrange the departments based on this information.

Since the finance department is next to the planning department, we can rule out options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], as they do not have the finance and planning departments adjacent.

Now, let's consider options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. In both options, the finance department is next to the planning department, and the administration department is above the planning department. However, in option [REDACTED], the human resources department is adjacent to the sales department, which contradicts the given information.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option [REDACTED].
