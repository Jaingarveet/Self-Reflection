Solution:
The argument is that seals caused the reduction of crocodiles, but this is difficult to establish because seals rarely feed on crocodiles.
To weaken the argument, we need to find a reason why crocodiles might have declined that is unrelated to seals or find a reason why seals could have indirectly caused the decline of crocodiles.
Choice [REDACTED] provides a reason why seals could have indirectly caused the decline of crocodiles. If capelin is the main food for both seals and crocodiles, then an increase in the number of seals could have led to a decrease in the availability of capelin, which could have caused the decline of crocodiles.
