Solution:
We know that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station.
We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station.
Since Fuyi is east of Haoyun and west of Huyao, it must be in the middle of the five stations.
Since Jiushang is adjacent to Haoyun and east of Haoyun, it must be to the east of Haoyun.
Since Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling, Yinling must be to the west of Jiushang.
Therefore, Huyao Station must be to the east of Fuyi Station.
