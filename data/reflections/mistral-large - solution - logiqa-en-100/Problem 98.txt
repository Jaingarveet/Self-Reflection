Solution:
The argument in the question stem is that right and wrong and whether they violate the rules are two different things. There may be regulations that prohibit things that are not inherently wrong, and there may be regulations that require things that are inherently wrong.

Choice [REDACTED] does not support the argument because it suggests that regulations are necessary to judge right and wrong, which contradicts the idea that right and wrong are separate from regulations.

Choice [REDACTED] does not support the argument because it suggests that ethical regulations are absolute and not subject to variation.

Choice [REDACTED] does not support the argument because it suggests that rules or standards are always behind judgments of right and wrong, which contradicts the idea that right and wrong are separate from regulations.

Choice [REDACTED] supports the argument by suggesting that moral regulations vary from person to person and from place to place, which means that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong depending on the context.
