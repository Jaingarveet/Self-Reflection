Solution:
The members of the printing group are [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M.
The members of the binding group are [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and J.
If K replaces [REDACTED], then [REDACTED] and K would be in the same group, violating condition (2).
If K replaces [REDACTED], then K would not be in the same group as J, but J is not in the printing group, so condition (3) is not violated. Also, M is still in one of the groups, and [REDACTED] is in both groups, so conditions (4) and (5) are satisfied.
If K replaces [REDACTED], then K would be in the same group as J, but [REDACTED] is the only employee in both groups, so condition (5) would be violated.
If K replaces [REDACTED], then K would not be in the same group as J, violating condition (3).
