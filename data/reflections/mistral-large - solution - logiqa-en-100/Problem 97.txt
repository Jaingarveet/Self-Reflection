Solution:
The argument is based on the comparison of posts about social issues published by netizens in the past year and 5 years ago, and concludes that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating. However, the argument assumes that the increase in posts about certain social issues is a reliable indicator of the social atmosphere.

Choice [REDACTED] states that the online forum is a legal forum. This means that the forum may have rules and regulations that prohibit certain types of posts, such as posts related to evildoing, escaping evil, and killing more people. If the forum has become more strict in enforcing these rules in the past year, it could explain the increase in posts about certain social issues without necessarily indicating a deterioration in the social atmosphere.
