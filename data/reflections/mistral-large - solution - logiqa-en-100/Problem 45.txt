Solution:
The question asks for the option that is true and raises the most doubts about the official's argument. Option [REDACTED] is true and raises doubts about the official's argument because it highlights the fact that China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes, which means that everyone who buys and consumes commodities pays taxes to the state, regardless of their income level. This undermines the official's argument that a high starting point for personal income tax would deprive low-income earners of the honor of being taxpayers.
