Solution:
From the given information, we know that paper E cannot be used (item 4).
Since paper E is not used, paper K is also not used (item 1).
Since paper K is not used, we cannot determine whether paper G is used or not (item 3).
Since paper G may or may not be used, we cannot determine whether paper J is used or not (item 2).
However, we know for certain that paper J is not used in the case where paper G is used (item 2).
Therefore, the only certain conclusion is that paper J is not used.
