Solution:
The question asks for the option that raises the most doubts about the experts' opinion that the decline in the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang is due to cattle and sheep trampling them to death.

Option [REDACTED] does not necessarily contradict the experts' opinion, as the establishment of a nature reserve and increasing awareness of protection does not necessarily mean that the decline in numbers has stopped.

Option [REDACTED] suggests an alternative reason for the decline in numbers, which is a decrease in rainfall and groundwater level affecting the water source environment in which the salamanders live. This option raises doubts about the experts' opinion because it provides an alternative explanation for the decline in numbers that is unrelated to cattle and sheep.

Option [REDACTED] suggests that the salamanders avoid the trampling of cattle and sheep, which contradicts the experts' opinion. However, this option does not necessarily raise doubts about the experts' opinion, as it is still possible that some salamanders are being trampled despite their avoidance behavior.

Option [REDACTED] is irrelevant to the experts' opinion.

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED].
