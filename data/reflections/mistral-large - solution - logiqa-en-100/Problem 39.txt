Solution:
The laboratory has three types of robots, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
Type [REDACTED] can recognize colors, type [REDACTED] can recognize shapes, and type [REDACTED] can neither recognize colors nor shapes.
Robot No.1 picked up red squares instead of red balls, which means it either cannot recognize shapes or cannot recognize colors. Therefore, it cannot be type [REDACTED], but it could be type [REDACTED] or type [REDACTED].
Robot No.2 picked up blue balls instead of red balls, which means it either cannot recognize colors or cannot recognize shapes. Therefore, it cannot be type [REDACTED], but it could be type [REDACTED] or type [REDACTED].
The only option that must be true based on the information given is that robot No.1 is not type [REDACTED] and robot No.2 is not type [REDACTED].
