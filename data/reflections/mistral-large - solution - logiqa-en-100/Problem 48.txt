Solution:
The argument is that more and more rich people in China are transferring their property abroad, as evidenced by the increase in transaction volume of US real estate bought by mainland Chinese buyers.
Choice B argues that the increase in transaction volume may be due to a small group of wealthy Chinese speculators, rather than a larger number of Chinese buyers.
This suggests that the increase in transaction volume may not necessarily reflect an increase in the number of Chinese buyers transferring their property abroad.
