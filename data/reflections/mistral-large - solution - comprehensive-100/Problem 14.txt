Solution:
From the given information, we can deduce that the Human Resources Department cannot be on the top floor since it is not above the Administration Department.
Also, the Sales Department cannot be adjacent to the Human Resources Department, but this does not mean that they cannot be one level apart.
Let's consider the options:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This is possible, but it does not necessarily avoid being adjacent to the Human Resources Department.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This is possible since the Administration Department is below the Human Resources Department, and the Sales Department can be one level above it without being adjacent to the Human Resources Department.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This is not possible since the Finance Department is next to the Planning Department.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This is possible, but it does not necessarily avoid being adjacent to the Human Resources Department.
