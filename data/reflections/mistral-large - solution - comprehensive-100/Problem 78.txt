Solution:
The process of digestion involves both physical and chemical changes. Physical changes involve a change in physical properties, such as shape, size, or state of matter, without changing the chemical composition of the substance. Chemical changes involve a change in chemical composition, resulting in the formation of new substances.

The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food. The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The breakdown of food substances by digestive juices (choice C) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, resulting in a change in chemical composition. The squeezing of food through the intestines (choice D) is a physical change because it involves changing the shape and position of the food without changing its chemical composition.
