Solution:
To find the two possible values for $c$, we need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation, we get $a(8-a) x^{2}+7 a x+2(8-a) x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a(8-a)=15$ and $7 a+16-2 a=c$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=31$ or $c=41$.
