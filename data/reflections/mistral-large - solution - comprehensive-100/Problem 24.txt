Solution:
Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, but they can give a morning report.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday (since she cannot give an afternoon report), if she gives a report on Monday morning, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, respectively. However, this would mean that Olivia and Robert cannot give reports, which contradicts the conditions. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday morning.
The only remaining option for Monday morning is Olivia.
Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday.
Since Helen and Irving must both give reports if Nina gives a report, and Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, Nina must give the afternoon report on Wednesday.
Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by [REDACTED].
