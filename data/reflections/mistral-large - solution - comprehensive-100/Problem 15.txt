Solution:
The question asks for the option that raises the most doubts about the experts' opinion, not necessarily the one that directly contradicts it.
The experts' opinion is that the decline in the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang is due to cattle and sheep trampling them to death.
Choice [REDACTED] does not directly contradict the experts' opinion, but rather suggests that efforts are being made to protect the salamanders.
Choice [REDACTED] suggests an alternative explanation for the decline in the number of salamanders, which is that the decrease in rainfall and groundwater level has affected their water source environment. This explanation raises doubts about the experts' opinion because it suggests that there may be other factors contributing to the decline in the number of salamanders.
Choice [REDACTED] directly contradicts the experts' opinion by suggesting that the salamanders avoid being trampled by hiding under rocks during the day. However, this explanation does not necessarily raise doubts about the experts' opinion, as it is still possible that some salamanders are being trampled despite their hiding behavior.
Choice [REDACTED] is irrelevant to the experts' opinion.
