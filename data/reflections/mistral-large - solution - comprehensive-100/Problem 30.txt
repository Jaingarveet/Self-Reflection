Solution:
Since G is placed on the top shelf, there must be at least one more book on the top shelf to meet the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf. Therefore, the top shelf can have a maximum of three books.
Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, the bottom shelf can have a minimum of three books and a maximum of five books.
Since I is placed on the middle shelf, there must be at least one more book on the middle shelf to meet the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf. Therefore, the middle shelf can have a maximum of three books.
Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and F is placed on the same shelf as M, K cannot be placed on the same shelf as F and M.
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, L cannot be placed on a higher shelf than O.
Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is [REDACTED].
