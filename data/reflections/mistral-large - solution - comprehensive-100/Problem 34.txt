Solution:
The argument is based on the future commute times of Acme employees after the move to Ocean View.
The argument assumes that the move will result in most employees having a commute of more than 30 minutes.
The argument does not provide information about the current commute times of Acme employees.
The argument does not provide information about the financial reasons for the move or the opinions of Acme employees.
The argument assumes that the move will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees, as this would potentially allow them to afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View.
