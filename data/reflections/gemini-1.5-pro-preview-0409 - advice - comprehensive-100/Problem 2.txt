Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the relationship between the number of pickets and the number of spaces. Remember, the number of spaces is typically one less than the number of pickets in a straight line.
 - Visualize the problem: Draw a simple diagram of the fence with a few pickets and spaces to help understand the pattern and relationships between elements.
 - Consider edge cases: Think about what happens when there is only one picket or a very small number of pickets. Does your solution still hold? 
 - Be mindful of units: Ensure you are working with consistent units (inches or feet) throughout your calculations and convert correctly when necessary.
