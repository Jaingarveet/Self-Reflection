Advice:
 - Always pay attention to the type of motion described in the problem (e.g., vertical, horizontal, circular).
 - Clearly distinguish between different types of speed (e.g., vertical speed, horizontal speed, average speed).
 - Recognize that not all problems can be solved with the given information.
 - If a problem cannot be solved, explain why and identify the missing information.
