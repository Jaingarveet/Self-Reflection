Instructions:
1. Identify the specific assertion being tested by the question.
2. Consider each answer choice carefully in terms of how it relates to that assertion. 
3. Don't just look for direct contradiction; consider more subtle implications that could call the assertion into doubt without disproving it entirely.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are overly broad, irrelevant to the specific assertion, or actually support the assertion.
5. Select the choice that most effectively calls the targeted assertion into question, even if indirectly.
