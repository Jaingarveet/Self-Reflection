Solution:
The author's assertion is that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is the first to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
The question asks which statement would call the author's assertion into question.
Choice [REDACTED] states that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
This statement would call the author's assertion into question because it suggests that other novels could also be considered musical in nature, not just Jazz.
