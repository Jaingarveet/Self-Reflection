Solution:
The passage discusses two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding and the criticisms they face. The first proposal is to teach about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, while the second proposal is to adopt a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures. However, critics argue that both proposals are not essentially different from each other because they are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system. The main point of the passage is to highlight the flaws in both proposals and the need for a more nuanced approach to multicultural education.
