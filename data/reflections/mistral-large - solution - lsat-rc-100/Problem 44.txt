Solution:
The passage discusses the use of proverbs in Mexican American communities and their various functions, including the instruction of the young, regulation of peer-group relationships, and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity. It also mentions that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the most frequent use of proverbs is in regulating peer-group relationships. However, the passage does not suggest that this is the only or even the most important function of proverbs in Mexican American communities. Instead, it emphasizes that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
