Solution:
To solve the problem again, I would first carefully read the question and the answer choices to ensure that I understand what is being asked. I would then identify the three positions presented in the passage and analyze how they are organized. I would notice that the third position is differentiated from the second position in detail, rather than from the first position. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
