Solution:
The author's primary purpose in the passage is to describe a particular aspect of one work by a particular writer, specifically how Toni Morrison uses jazz as a structuring principle in her novel Jazz. The author discusses how the narrative slips easily from third-person omniscience to first-person lyricism, and how this is analogous to the playing of a jazz band. The author also highlights how Morrison's use of language and narrative point of view serves to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.
