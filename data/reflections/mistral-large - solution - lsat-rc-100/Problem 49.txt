Solution:
The passage defines a proverb as a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom.
The passage also states that each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.
Therefore, the statement that is most strongly implied by the passage is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]"
