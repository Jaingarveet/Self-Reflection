Solution:
The passage discusses the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region. It highlights the use of familiar linguistic and thematic conventions, including the use of everyday images and ready-made lines, which serve to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. The passage also mentions that corridos have roots in eighteenth-century Spain.

The question asks which statement the author would most likely agree with. The correct answer is [REDACTED], as the passage mentions that the despedida, or formal closing verse, is a clear marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity. Without a despedida, a corrido would lack this important marker.
