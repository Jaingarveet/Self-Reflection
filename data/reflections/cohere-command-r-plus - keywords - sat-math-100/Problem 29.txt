Solution: We are given that the weight of an object on Earth is $W = 150$ newtons, and we want to find the planet where this object would weigh approximately $170$ newtons. Using the formula $W = mg$, we can calculate the mass of the object:
\[ 150 = m \cdot 9.8 \]
\[ m \approx 15.3 \]

Now, we can find the planet where the product of mass and acceleration due to gravity is closest to $170$. 

For Choice [REDACTED], [REDACTED]:
\[ W = 15.3 \cdot 11.1 \approx 170.33 \]

Therefore, Choice [REDACTED], [REDACTED], is the correct answer.
