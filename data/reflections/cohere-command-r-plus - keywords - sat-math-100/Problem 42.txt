Solution: We are given the equation:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$

Expanding the left side:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$

Comparing coefficients:
$ab = 15$
$7a = c$
$2b = 14 \Rightarrow b = 7$

We are also given $a + b = 8$. Plugging in $b = 7$:
$a + 7 = 8 \Rightarrow a = 1$

Now, we can find the value of $c$ from the equation $7a = c$:
$7a = c \Rightarrow c = 7a$
$c = 7(1) = 7$

So, the two possible values for $c$ are both 7. The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], as these are the only options that yield a value of 7 when added together.
