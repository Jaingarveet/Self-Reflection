Solution: To find the equation of a linear function, we typically use the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can calculate the slope using any two points from the table:

$m=\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\frac{1+2}{-2}=3$

Now, we can use the y-intercept, which is given as $f(0)$, to find $b$:

$b=f(0)=3$

Therefore, the equation of the linear function is $f(n)=3n+3$, which matches option [REDACTED]: $f(n)=3n-5$.
