Solution: We are looking for the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to $1,000$. Let's plug in the given values and solve:

$$1,000=1,052+1.08 t$$

Subtract $1,052$ from both sides:

$$-52=1.08 t$$

Divide both sides by $1.08$ to solve for $t$:

$$t \approx -48.15$$

Given the choices, [REDACTED] is the closest value to $-48.15^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
