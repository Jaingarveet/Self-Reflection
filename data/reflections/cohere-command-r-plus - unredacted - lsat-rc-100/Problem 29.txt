Explanation: I misinterpreted the information in the passage. While it is true that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments about the possibility of splitting atoms, the correct answer, Choice E, focuses on a different aspect: the recognition of the dangers of working with radioactive substances. Error Keywords: - Misinterpretation - Omission Solution: The passage discusses the historical context of nuclear fission discovery and the challenges faced by physicists in the 1930s. It mentions that "precise chemical analyses were hampered [...] and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials." This directly relates to Choice E, which states that the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances. Instructions: 1. Read the passage carefully and identify the key historical developments and challenges mentioned. 2. Focus on the specific details provided in the passage. 3. Analyze each choice carefully and determine if it is directly supported by the information in the passage. 4. Avoid making assumptions or inferences that go beyond the scope of the provided information. 5. Choose the answer that most accurately aligns with the explicit details mentioned in the passage. Advice: - Read the passage thoroughly and pay attention to historical context and specific challenges faced by the physics community. - Avoid making interpretations or assumptions that go beyond the explicit information provided. - Focus on the explicit details and choose the answer that directly aligns with the provided information. - Be cautious not to overlook important keywords or phrases that may impact the correct choice.
