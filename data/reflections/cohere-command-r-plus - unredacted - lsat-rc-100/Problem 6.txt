Explanation: I misinterpreted the main point of Passage A. I focused on the idea that altruistic behaviors ultimately serve the selfish purpose of gene propagation, as illustrated by the example of a mother's instinct to protect her child. However, I overlooked the key role of "cues of kinship or familiarity" in provoking the psychological states that lead to altruistic behaviors.

Solution: Passage A discusses the evolutionary puzzle of altruism and introduces the idea that altruistic behaviors can be understood from an evolutionary perspective. It suggests that the presence of shared genetic material in early human ancestors may have triggered psychological states of identification and empathy, leading to behaviors that promote the welfare of kin. This explanation centers on the role of "cues of kinship or familiarity" in provoking these psychological states and, ultimately, altruistic behaviors. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the topic of the passage: evolutionary psychology and the puzzle of altruism. 
2. Understand the structure of the passage: it presents a problem (altruism from an evolutionary standpoint) and proposes a potential solution (the role of psychological states triggered by cues of kinship). 
3. Note the key relationship between cues of kinship, psychological states, and altruistic behaviors. 
4. Recognize that the passage emphasizes the evolutionary explanation for altruism, not the gene propagation aspect, which is a mechanism within this explanation. 
5. Choose the answer option that reflects this emphasis on the evolutionary perspective and the role of psychological states. 

Answer: E

Advice: 
 - Ensure a comprehensive understanding of the passage by identifying its topic, structure, and key relationships. 
 - Distinguish between central arguments and supporting examples or mechanisms. 
 - Be cautious when interpreting negative or contrary statements (e.g., "altruism seems unselfish"). 
 - Recognize keywords or themes that indicate the correct answer, such as "evolutionary explanation" and "psychological states." 
 - Avoid oversimplification or making assumptions based on partial information.
