Explanation: I misinterpreted the relationship between the two parts of the text. I focused on the similar underlying principles in both arguments, overlooking the fact that one perspective was a counterargument to the other. The correct answer is B because the sentences at lines 28-31 present an opposing opinion to the one in lines 7-11, despite sharing some common ground.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking relationship
- Overemphasizing common ground

Solution: The passage presents a debate about the ethical obligations of defense lawyers. The author acknowledges the scholars' view that lawyers should not judge defendants and must provide the best defense (lines 7-11). However, lines 28-31 introduce a counterargument, stating that lawyers should not present known false assertions and should not deny guilt if they are certain of it. This counterargument qualifies the broad argument made earlier, acknowledging its merits but offering a nuanced perspective that prioritizes the lawyer's obligation to the court and society. Thus, the relationship between these parts is one of general agreement but with a specific disagreement, making choice B the correct answer.

Instructions:
1. Identify the context of the question: ethical obligations of defense lawyers.
2. Understand the structure of the passage: a presentation of opposing arguments.
3. Interpret the relationship between the two parts: one presents a counterargument to the other while sharing some common ground.
4. Recognize that choice B accurately describes this relationship.

Advice:
- Carefully consider the context and structure of the passage.
- Interpret the relationship between different parts of the text critically.
- Look for nuances and qualifications in the arguments presented.
- Recognize that authors may agree on broad principles but disagree on specific applications.
- Avoid overemphasizing common ground while ignoring opposing perspectives.
