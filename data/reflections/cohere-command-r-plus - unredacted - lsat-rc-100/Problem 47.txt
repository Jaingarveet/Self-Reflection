Explanation: I focused too much on the tone and conclusions of the passages and failed to recognize the key difference in their scope and level of detail. I should have paid closer attention to the fact that Passage B is more general and abstract in its discussion of the issues, while Passage A delves into specific arguments and examples. 

Error Keywords:
- Scope error
- Focus error
- Abstraction error

Solution: Passage A provides a specific context of a criminal case and discusses the admissibility of fingerprint evidence, citing the long history of its use, consistent standards, and reliability. Passage B, on the other hand, takes a step back and discusses the field of fingerprint examination in a more abstract and general manner. It raises concerns about the lack of standardized criteria and questions the scientific basis and systematic study of fingerprint identification. 

Passage A is focused on a specific legal case and provides detailed arguments and examples to support the reliability of fingerprint evidence. Passage B, however, takes a broader perspective and discusses the field of fingerprint examination at a more abstract level. It raises concerns about the lack of consensus and standardized criteria without delving into specific legal contexts or providing concrete examples. Therefore, the correct answer is "B: general in focus." 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the key differences between Passage A and Passage B in terms of scope, focus, and level of detail. 
2. Recognize that Passage A is specific and concrete, while Passage B is more abstract and general. 
3. Note that Passage A discusses a specific legal case and provides detailed arguments, while Passage B takes a broader perspective and raises concerns about the field in general. 
4. Understand that the correct answer will reflect the difference in the level of abstraction and specificity between the passages. 

Advice: 
- Pay close attention to the scope and focus of the passages. 
- Recognize the difference between specific, concrete discussions and abstract, general statements. 
- Understand that the level of detail and specificity can be a critical factor in distinguishing between options. 
- Avoid focusing solely on tone or conclusions, but also consider the context and level of abstraction. 
- Always read and understand the full context of the passages provided.
