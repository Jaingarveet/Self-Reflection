Explanation: I misinterpreted the author's criticism of evolutionary psychology and the concept of genetic self-propagation. I focused on the idea that individuals may not be aware of or acknowledge the role of their genes, but I missed the key point about the potential for multiple interests and motives to explain behaviors. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Omission
- Overlooking context

Solution: The author of Passage B criticizes the assumption that evolutionary psychology makes, which is to explain human behavior solely from the perspective of genetic self-propagation. They argue that this reduces complex human behavior to a single motive, ignoring the possibility of multiple interests and motives. 

Passage A makes the argument that altruistic behavior can be explained by evolutionary psychology, suggesting that it contributes to the propagation of genes for identification and empathy. However, the author of Passage B would see this as an oversimplification. They would argue that altruism could be motivated by other factors, such as an inherent interest in the welfare of others, and that it is rare for a single interest to decisively explain a behavior. 

Therefore, the correct answer is: 

**Choice C**: "To explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans." 

This choice captures the mistaken assumption that Passage B criticizes, which is the simplistic application of evolutionary theory to explain complex human behavior.
