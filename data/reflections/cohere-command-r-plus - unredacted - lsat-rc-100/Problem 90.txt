Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and the context of the correct answer choice. 
I focused too narrowly on the narrative style and structure and overlooked the broader discussion of African American artistic achievements and the novel's contribution to literature. 
I missed the key phrase "each of the following excerpts ... EXCEPT," which indicates that I should identify the option that does NOT reflect the author's attitude. 
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Context misunderstanding
- Overlooking key details
Solution:
The correct answer is choice "A." 
The phrase "one of the greatest contributions to North American art" (lines 9-10) reflects a positive view of African American music as a significant artistic achievement. 
While this sentiment aligns with the overall discussion of the importance of African American artistic expressions, it does not specifically relate to the author's attitude toward the novel "Jazz" and its narrative structure or stylistic achievements. 
The other options (B, C, D, and E) all refer to the unique narrative techniques and stylistic choices employed by Toni Morrison in her novel "Jazz."
Instructions:
1. Read and understand the full context of the passage.
2. Identify the correct answer choice that does NOT reflect the author's attitude toward the novel "Jazz."
3. Analyze each choice and assess if it reflects the author's attitude toward the novel's narrative style, structure, or thematic concerns. 
4. Look for phrases or sentences that stand out as not directly related to the novel "Jazz" but rather to a broader context. 
5. Remember to select the option that does NOT align with the author's attitude toward the novel.
