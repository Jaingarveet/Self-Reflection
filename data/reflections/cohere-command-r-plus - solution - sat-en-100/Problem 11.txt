Solution:
The table has two main sections, one for colonies with colony collapse disorder and one for colonies without. In the row for "All four pathogens," it shows that 100% of colonies without collapse disorder were affected, but for colonies with collapse disorder, the percentage is 77%. This data is found at the intersection of the "All four pathogens" row and the "Colonies with colony collapse disorder" section.
