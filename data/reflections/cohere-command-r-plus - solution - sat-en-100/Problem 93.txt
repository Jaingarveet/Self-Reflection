Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] 

Hodick and Sievers proposed a model based on the accumulation of electric charge triggered by the stimulation of hairs. Volkov's experiment applied an electrical current directly to the lobes, bypassing the natural process. While this method successfully induced the trap to close, it did not directly measure calcium levels or demonstrate that the proposed mechanism was incorrect. Therefore, Volkov's measurements did not fully support the central element of the model, which is a potential criticism of his testing approach.
