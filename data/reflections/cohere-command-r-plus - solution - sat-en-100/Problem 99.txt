Solution:
The first paragraph sets the scene and provides context for the story. It introduces the characters of Akira, Chie, and Naomi, and describes Akira's unconventional approach of proposing directly, without following the traditional method of using a go-between. The paragraph then shifts to Chieving her reaction to this unexpected proposal and her thoughts on the matter, including her maternal amusement and perception of Akira as a child. 
The main purpose of this paragraph is to analyze Chie's reaction to Akira's direct proposal and explore her thoughts and emotions in response to this unexpected turn of events.
