Solution:
The question asks for a scenario in which the Venus flytrap **does not** close, according to Hodick and Sievers's model. 

Hodick and Sievers proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close. [REDACTED] single stimulation of a trigger hair does not produce enough calcium to reach this threshold. Therefore, both hairs need to be stimulated within a short time frame to produce a combined calcium concentration that exceeds the threshold, causing the trap to close. 

Choice [REDACTED] describes a scenario where there is a period of inactivity between the first and second contacts, allowing calcium ion concentrations to diminish. In this case, even if a second hair is stimulated, the total concentration may not be enough to reach the threshold, and the trap will not close. This contradicts the model, which predicts that the trap should close with two stimulations within a short time frame.
