Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen and involves the breakdown of glucose to produce energy. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is [REDACTED] and 2 NADH, which are produced when glucose is converted to pyruvate and then pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.
