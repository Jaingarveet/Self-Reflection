Solution:

1. Review the characteristics of each stage of anesthesia, paying close attention to the differences between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].
2. Understand that in [REDACTED] anesthesia, the patient may exhibit signs of increased muscle tone or tremors, whereas in [REDACTED] anesthesia, the patient is in a state of deep anesthesia and may exhibit signs of decreased muscle tone.
3. Recall that the patient becomes hyperactive in [REDACTED] anesthesia, not [REDACTED].
