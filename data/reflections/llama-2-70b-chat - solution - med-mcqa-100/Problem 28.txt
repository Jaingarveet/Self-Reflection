Solution:
Islet cell transplantation for diabetes mellitus involves transplanting islet cells from a donor pancreas into a recipient with type 1 diabetes. The transplanted cells can produce insulin, regulating the recipient's blood sugar levels. The transplantation site should provide adequate blood supply and minimize the risk of immune rejection.

The correct answer is "[REDACTED]: Injected into the portal vein". Islet cells are typically injected into the portal vein, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver. This site allows the islet cells to mix with the blood supply and distribute throughout the body, reducing the risk of rejection and promoting their survival.
