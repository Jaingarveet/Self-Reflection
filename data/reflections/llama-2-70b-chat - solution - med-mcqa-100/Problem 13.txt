Solution:

1. Review the imaging modalities and their indications for pyloric stenosis.
2. Understand that [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is the initial imaging modality of choice for pyloric stenosis.
3. Recognize that [REDACTED] scan is a more invasive and expensive modality that should be used when [REDA[REDACTED]ED] is equivocal or when there are other indications for its use.
