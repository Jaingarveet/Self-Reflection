Solution:
Inferior alveolar nerve block is a regional anesthesia technique used to anesthetize the lower teeth and surrounding tissues.
The inferior alveolar nerve is located in the pterygomandibular space, which is a compartment in the neck that contains the mandibular ramus and other structures.
To perform an inferior alveolar nerve block, the needle is inserted in the pterygomandibular space, inferior to the mandibular ramus, and the local anesthetic is injected.
