Solution:
Spondylolisthesis is a condition where a vertebra in the spine slips out of place.
The best imaging investigations for diagnosing and assessing spondylolisthesis would be X-rays (anteroposterior and lateral view) and [REDACTED] scans, as they can help visualize the bony structures and alignment of the spine.
[REDACTED] can also be useful in some cases to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.
The least useful investigation for Spondylolisthesis would be an [REDACTED], as it is not as effective in visualizing bony structures and alignment as X-rays and [REDACTED] scans.
