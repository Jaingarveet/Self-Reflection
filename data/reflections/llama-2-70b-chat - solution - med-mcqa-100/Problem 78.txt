Solution:
The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies blood to the face.
It terminates in the anastomosis with the infraorbital artery, which is a branch of the ophthalmic artery.
The infraorbital artery supplies blood to the lower eyelid, the lacrimal gland, and the nasal cavity.
It anastomoses with the facial artery to form a ring of blood vessels around the eye.
