Solution:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune bullous disease that targets the basement membrane zone.
The salt split skin technique is a diagnostic tool used to identify the presence of autoantibodies in the patient's serum.
In this technique, the patient's skin is split with a salt solution, and the resulting blister fluid is tested for the presence of autoantibodies.
The autoantibodies in the blister fluid will bind to the corresponding antigens on the epidermal side of the split skin.
In cicatricial pemphigoid, IgG autoantibodies in the patient's serum will bind to [REDACTED] (collagen type XVII) on the epidermal side of the split skin, confirming the diagnosis of cicatricial pemphigoid.
