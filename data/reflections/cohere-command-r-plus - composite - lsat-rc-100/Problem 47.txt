Solution: Passage [REDACTED] provides a specific context of a criminal case and discusses the admissibility of fingerprint evidence, citing the long history of its use, consistent standards, and reliability. Passage [REDACTED], on the other hand, takes a step back and discusses the field of fingerprint examination in a more abstract and general manner. It raises concerns about the lack of standardized criteria and questions the scientific basis and systematic study of fingerprint identification. 

Passage [REDACTED] is focused on a specific legal case and provides detailed arguments and examples to support the reliability of fingerprint evidence. Passage [REDACTED], however, takes a broader perspective and discusses the field of fingerprint examination at a more abstract level. It raises concerns about the lack of consensus and standardized criteria without delving into specific legal contexts or providing concrete examples. Therefore, the correct answer is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]."
