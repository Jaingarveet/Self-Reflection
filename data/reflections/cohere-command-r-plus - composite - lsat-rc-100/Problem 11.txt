- Overlooking negation

Solution: The author's assertion is that Toni Morrison intentionally structured her novel 'Jazz' to mimic the style of a jazz performance, with an interplay between ensemble and solo voices. 

To identify which choice would "most call into question" this assertion, we need to find the one that contradicts or challenges this idea. 

Choice [REDACTED] does this by stating a universal truth: "any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature." This implies that all novels inherently possess musical qualities, regardless of the author's intention or the narrative structure. This challenges the author's assertion that Morrison's novel is unique in its simulation of jazz, as it suggests that any novel could be interpreted as musical. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the question: Identify what the author is asserting and what you need to find among the choices.

3. Analyze each choice: 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: This is a specific example of the author's assertion and does not challenge it. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: While this choice mentions other authors, it does not directly refute the unique aspect of Morrison's approach. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: This choice is too broad and does not consider the specific structuring principle Morrison employed. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: This choice presents a universal truth, implying that all novels could be musical, regardless of intent. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: This choice is irrelevant to the author's assertion about narrative structure. 
4. Choose the option that contradicts or challenges the author's assertion by presenting a broader or universal truth.

   - Avoid choices that are specific examples of the author's assertion. 
   - Look for choices that present broader truths or challenge the uniqueness of the author's claim. 
   - Be cautious of choices that are too broad or irrelevant to the specific structuring principle discussed.
