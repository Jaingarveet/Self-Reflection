Solution: The passage presents a debate about the ethical obligations of defense lawyers. The author acknowledges the scholars' view that lawyers should not judge defendants and must provide the best defense (lines 7-11). However, lines 28-31 introduce a counterargument, stating that lawyers should not present known false assertions and should not deny guilt if they are certain of it. This counterargument qualifies the broad argument made earlier, acknowledging its merits but offering a nuanced perspective that prioritizes the lawyer's obligation to the court and society. Thus, the relationship between these parts is one of general agreement but with a specific disagreement, making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.
