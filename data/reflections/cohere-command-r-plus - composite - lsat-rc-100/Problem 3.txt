Solution: The correct answer is [REDACTED]. If making workers more specialized does not lead to increased productivity, it weakens the argument that larger firms with specialized workers have an inherent advantage over smaller ones. This directly challenges the idea that increased size leads to monopoly power. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the question: Identify the connection the author draws between firm size and monopoly power. 
2. Analyze the choices: For each choice, consider if it weakens the connection between firm size and monopoly power, specifically addressing the role of increased size leading to increased market power. 
3. Evaluate the correct answer: Choice [REDACTED] undermines the idea that larger firms with specialized workers are inherently more productive, which is a key link in the argument for the connection between size and market power. 

Advice:
1. Understand the Context: Ensure you grasp the underlying argument and the concepts being discussed, in this case, the relationship between firm size, specialization, and market power. 
2. Identify Key Connections: Note the connections the author draws between concepts and identify which of these connections are being challenged by the question. 
3. Evaluate Choices Carefully: Each choice should be evaluated in the context of the specific connection being discussed, rather than general statements about the topic. 
4. Avoid Red Herrings: Be cautious of choices that may be true but do not directly address the specific connection in question.
