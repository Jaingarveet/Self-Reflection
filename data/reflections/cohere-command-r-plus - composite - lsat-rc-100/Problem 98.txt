Explanation:
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Relationship misunderstanding
- Inverse relationship

Solution: The author suggests that the two strategies for deterring deliberate crimes are not mutually exclusive and that an optimal approach combines elements from both. The economic principle of utility maximization states that individuals will choose actions that maximize their expected utility, weighing the potential benefits and costs of different options. 

Statement [REDACTED]: The author agrees that stricter punishments for repeat offenders increase the expected cost of criminal activity, making it less attractive, and thus supporting a decrease in recidivism. 

Statement [REDACTED]: Ending rehabilitation efforts removes a potential source of increased expected utility for lawful activity, which could lead to an increase in criminal activity, as suggested. 

Statement [REDACTED]: Incorrect interpretation. Increasing the expected utility of lawful activities makes unlawful activities less attractive, thus decreasing the rate of deliberate crimes. This is the inverse relationship I missed. 

Statement [REDACTED]: Restricting access to economic institutions decreases the expected utility of lawful activity, making unlawful activities relatively more attractive, and leading to a potential increase in deliberate crimes, as the author suggests. 

Statement [REDACTED]: The correct answer. The author suggests that stronger law enforcement decreases the expected utility of criminal activity, making it less attractive, and thus should lead to a decrease, not an increase, in deliberate crimes. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Understand the context: The debate centers on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, with two opposing viewpoints and an economic principle to reconcile them. 
2. Identify the author's stance: The author suggests that the two strategies are not mutually exclusive and that an optimal approach combines elements from both. 
3. Analyze each statement: 
    - [REDACTED]: Stricter punishments increase expected costs, supporting a decrease in recidivism. 
    - [REDACTED]: Ending rehabilitation removes a source of increased expected utility for lawful activity, potentially increasing criminal activity. 
    - [REDACTED]: Increasing the expected utility of lawful activities makes unlawful activities less attractive, decreasing deliberate crimes. 
    - [REDACTED]: Restricting access decreases expected utility for lawful activity, making unlawful activities relatively more attractive. 
    - [REDACTED]: Stronger law enforcement decreases the expected utility of criminal activity, making it less attractive. 
4. Identify the inverse relationship: Statement [REDACTED] presents the inverse relationship between the expected utility of lawful activity and the rate of deliberate crimes. 
5. Correct interpretation: Increasing the expected utility of lawful activities makes unlawful activities less attractive, leading to a decrease in deliberate crimes, not an increase. 

Advice:
 - Understand the context and identify the author's stance. 
 - Carefully analyze each statement option, applying the provided context and any relevant principles or theories. 
 - Look for keywords and phrases that indicate relationships, such as "increase," "decrease," "inverse," "direct," etc. 
 - Pay attention to potential misinterpretations, especially when dealing with inverse relationships or counterintuitive concepts. 
 - Double-check your interpretation against the provided context and principles to ensure accuracy.
