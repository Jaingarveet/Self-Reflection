Instructions:
1. Choose a variable to eliminate by manipulating one or both equations.
2. Multiply one or both equations by appropriate constants to achieve the same coefficient for the chosen variable with opposite signs.
3. Add or subtract the equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
4. Solve for the remaining variable.
5. Substitute the value of the found variable back into one of the original equations.
6. Solve for the other variable, paying close attention to signs during calculations.
7. Write the solution as an ordered pair (x, y).
8. Double-check your solution by substituting both values back into both original equations to ensure they hold true.
