Instructions:
1. Determine the width of each picket-space unit (picket width + space width).
2. Identify the number of pickets (x).
3. Calculate the number of spaces between the pickets (x-1).
4. Determine the total number of picket-space units (pickets + spaces).
5. Multiply the width of each unit by the total number of units to get the length in inches.
6. Convert the length from inches to feet by dividing by 12.
7. Simplify the expression for the length in feet.
