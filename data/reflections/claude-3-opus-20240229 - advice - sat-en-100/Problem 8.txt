Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully to identify exactly what information you need to answer it.
 - Pay close attention to the specific wording of the question, as small details can change the meaning.
 - When working with tables or figures, take time to orient yourself and understand what data is shown in each row and column.
 - Be careful not to mix up similar-sounding row or column labels.
 - Double-check that you are looking at the correct row(s) and column(s) before reading any data values.
 - If the correct answer is not obvious based on the data, re-read the question to make sure you are answering what is actually being asked.
