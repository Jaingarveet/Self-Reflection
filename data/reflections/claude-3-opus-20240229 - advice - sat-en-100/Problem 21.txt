Advice:
 - Always read carefully to identify the main idea, not just isolated details.
 - Focus on what the author states explicitly, not just what is implied.
 - Make sure your answer is supported by direct textual evidence.
 - Don't be swayed by peripheral details that don't address the central point.
 - Eliminate answers that are too extreme or absolute if not supported by the passage.
