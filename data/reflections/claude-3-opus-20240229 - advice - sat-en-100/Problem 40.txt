Advice:
- Always focus on the specific character trait or aspect that the question is asking about. 
- Prioritize direct characterization and primary details over indirect or secondary ones.
- Be careful not to misinterpret a character's actions or traits, or to be misled by less relevant details.
- Base your answer on evidence from throughout the passage rather than a single instance.
