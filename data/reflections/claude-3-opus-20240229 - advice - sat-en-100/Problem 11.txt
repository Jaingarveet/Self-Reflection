Advice:
 - Always read questions carefully to ensure you are finding the right data to answer the specific question asked.
 - Don't just look for explicit answers; use the given data to infer or calculate implicit answers.
 - With combined criteria like "all" or "and", the limiting factor is the smallest individual percentage.
 - If data seems to be missing, look for clues in the surrounding data that could help fill in the gap.
 - Practice active reading of data tables, graphs and passages to improve extraction of key information.
