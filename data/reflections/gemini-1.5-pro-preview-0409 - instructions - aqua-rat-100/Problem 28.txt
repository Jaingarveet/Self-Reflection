Instructions:
1. Calculate the probability of each event not occurring individually.
2. Identify the smaller of the two individual non-occurrence probabilities.
3. Recognize that the maximum joint non-occurrence probability cannot exceed the smallest individual non-occurrence probability.
4. Select the answer that corresponds to the smaller individual non-occurrence probability.
