Solution: The table does not provide direct evidence about mite infections or their role in increasing susceptibility to secondary infections. While the data show higher pathogen infection rates in colonies with CC[REDACTED], it does not confirm a causal relationship between mite infections and CC[REDACTED]. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the context, including any tables or figures provided. 
2. Identify the specific claim made by the authors about mite infections and their impact on susceptibility to secondary infections. 
3. Examine the table to determine if it provides evidence regarding mite infections and their relationship to CC[REDACTED]. 
4. Assess if the data support or refute the authors' claim about mite infections. 
5. Choose the answer option that accurately reflects the relationship between the data and the authors' claim. 

Advice:
 - Ensure a thorough understanding of the context and any associated data before answering. 
 - Focus on the specific claim being made and evaluate if the data directly address that claim. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not explicitly supported by the data. 
 - Consider all aspects of the data and avoid selective interpretation.
