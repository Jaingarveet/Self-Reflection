Solution: The passage discusses an experiment by Hartmann, where one agricultural strip was plowed during the day and another at night, with no crops planted to avoid competition with weeds. The key sentence states, "No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds." This sentence indicates that the absence of crops was intended to isolate the effect of plowing time on weed growth, suggesting that the presence of crops could influence weed coverage. 

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and identify the relevant information.
2. Understand the experimental design and the variables being tested.
3. Note the absence of crops in the experiment and the reason given for this.
4. Consider how the presence of crops might impact weed coverage.
5. Infer that the percentage of weed coverage with crops present is uncertain.
6. Choose the answer option that reflects this uncertainty.

Advice:
- Read the passage thoroughly and identify critical information.
- Understand the experimental design and variables being tested.
- Consider the implications of any stated absences or exclusions in the experiment.
- Think about potential confounding factors that could influence the results.
- Make inferences based on the provided information and your understanding of the topic.
- Choose the answer option that best aligns with your inferences and the information presented in the passage.
