Explanation:
I misinterpreted the data in the table, focusing on the wrong column and row intersection. I mistakenly looked at the data for "Nosema ceranae" instead of the row indicating "All four pathogens."
Error Keywords:
- Data interpretation error
- Table reading error
- Misinterpretation

Solution:
The table has two main sections, one for colonies with colony collapse disorder and one for colonies without. In the row for "All four pathogens," it shows that 100% of colonies without collapse disorder were affected, but for colonies with collapse disorder, the percentage is 77%. This data is found at the intersection of the "All four pathogens" row and the "Colonies with colony collapse disorder" section. 

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand what data is being requested.
2. Identify the relevant table that contains the required data.
3. Locate the row and column headers that correspond to the requested information.
4. Find the intersection of the relevant row and column in the table.
5. Read the data at the intersection and choose the answer choice that matches this data.

Advice:
- Always read the question and table headers carefully to understand what data is being presented and what specific information is requested.
- Take your time to carefully locate the correct row and column intersection in the table to avoid misinterpretation. 
- Double-check that you are reading the correct data point and that it corresponds to the requested information.
