Explanation:

From the problem statement, we know that:

1. More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.

If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we can deduce the following:

1. H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
2. L must be placed on the middle shelf.

Now, let's evaluate each of the given choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and M is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that F and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is incorrect.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Since H is placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that G and H are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is incorrect.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Since M is placed on the same shelf as F, and F is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that H and M are placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is correct.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Since I is placed on the middle shelf, and G is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that I and G are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is incorrect.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and L is not placed on the bottom shelf, we can conclude that K and O are not placed on the same shelf. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
