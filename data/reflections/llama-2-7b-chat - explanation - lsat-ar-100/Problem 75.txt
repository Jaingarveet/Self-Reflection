Explanation:
The question asks for an accurate and complete list of students who review only Sunset, based on the given conditions. We need to analyze the information provided to determine which students review only Sunset.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. Kramer and [REDACTED] each review fewer plays than Megregian.
	* This means that Kramer and [REDACTED] do not review Sunset.
2. Neither [REDACTED] nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
	* This means that Jiang does not review Sunset.
3. Kramer and [REDACTED] both review Tamerlane.
	* This means that Kramer and [REDACTED] do not review Sunset.

Now, let's consider the remaining options:

A) [REDACTED] - Does not review Sunset as per condition 1.
B) [REDACTED] - Does not review Sunset as per condition 3.
C) Jiang, [REDACTED] - Both do not review Sunset as per condition 2.
D) Kramer, [REDACTED] - Both review Tamerlane, so they do not review Sunset.
E) [REDACTED], Megregian - Neither [REDACTED] nor Megregian reviews Sunset, so this option is not possible.

Therefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review only Sunset is:

Answer("[REDACTED]") Kramer, [REDACTED].

Correct Answer: A
