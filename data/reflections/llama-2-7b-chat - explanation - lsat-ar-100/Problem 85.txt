Explanation:

The correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].

Here's why:

From the conditions provided, we know that:

* Q is [REDACTED]
* S must be earlier than Q
* S cannot be in the [REDACTED] position (A)
* S cannot be in the [REDACTED] position (C)
* S cannot be in the [REDACTED] position (E)

So, the only possible position for article S is [REDACTED] (B).

Therefore, the answer is (D) [REDACTED].
