Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. After reevaluating the conditions and the options, I realized that the correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].

Here's my thought process:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.

Since Image's website target is 2 days, it means that [REDACTED] must be shorter than 2 days.

2. [REDACTED] must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.

Since [REDACTED] is 3 days, it means that [REDACTED] must be shorter than 3 days. Therefore, [REDACTED] is 2 days.

Therefore, the answer is (A) [REDACTED].
