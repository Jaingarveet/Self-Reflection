Explanation:
You are correct! The pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships is indeed [REDACTED].

Here's how we can deduce this answer:

1. If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must be assigned to a different ambassadorship.
2. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then neither Kayne nor Novetzke can be assigned to Yemen.

From these constraints, we can see that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Novetzke must be assigned to a different ambassadorship. Therefore, the only possible combination that satisfies both constraints is [REDACTED].

So, the answer is (B) [REDACTED]. Great job!
