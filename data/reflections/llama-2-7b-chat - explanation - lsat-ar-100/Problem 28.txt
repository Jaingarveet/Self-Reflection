Explanation:
The problem states that four of the selected scientists are F, L, Q, and R. Based on the conditions given in the problem, we need to select the fifth scientist such that the panel meets the requirements.

1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Since four of the selected scientists are botanists, we need to select one zoologist. Therefore, the fifth scientist must be a zoologist.
2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since four botanists have already been selected, we can select only one zoologist.
3. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected. Since [REDACTED] has already been selected, [REDACTED] cannot be selected.
4. If [REDACTED] is selected, both [REDACTED] and R must be selected. Since [REDACTED] has already been selected, [REDACTED] and R must be selected.

Based on the above analysis, the fifth scientist that must be selected is [REDACTED], the only remaining zoologist. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) - Zoologist.
