Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]

Here's how we can deduce this:

1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
	* Image's website target is 3 days, and its voicemail target is 2 days, so this condition is satisfied.
	* Solide's website target is 2 days, and its voicemail target is 3 days, so this condition is not satisfied.
	* Truvest's website target is 1 day, and its voicemail target is 1 day, so this condition is satisfied.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
	* Image's voicemail target is 2 days, and Solide's voicemail target is 3 days, so this condition is satisfied.
	* Image's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's voicemail target (1 day vs. 2 days).
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
	* Solide's website target is 2 days, and Truvest's website target is 1 day, so this condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the only possible combination of service targets that satisfies all the conditions is:

Image: Website target = 3 days, Voicemail target = 2 days
Solide: Website target = 2 days, Voicemail target = 3 days
Truvest: Website target = 1 day, Voicemail target = 1 day

So the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]
