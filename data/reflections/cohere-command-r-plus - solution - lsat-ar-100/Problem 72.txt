Solution:

Given Constraints: 
- Pharmacy at one end, restaurant at the other
- Restaurants separated by at least two businesses
- Pharmacy next to optometrist or veterinarian
- Toy store cannot be next to veterinarian

Additional Inferences: 
- As [REDACTED] must be at the ends, the optometrist and shoe store cannot occupy the end spaces. 
- The optometrist and shoe store must be adjacent to each other, leaving five spaces for the other businesses. 
- The toy store and veterinarian can be together, as this pair can be separated from the restaurant by two businesses. 

Final Arrangement: 
1. Pharmacy
2. Veterinarian
3. Toy Store
4. Optometrist
5. Shoe Store
6. Restaurant
7. Restaurant

The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store are the toy store and a restaurant.
