Solution:
Given that Y is the fourth article, we can deduce the following:
1. Articles G, H, and J must come before Y due to the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
2. Article J must come before G due to the given condition.
3. Therefore, J must be second for this sequence to be valid: [J, G or H, S, Y, ...].
