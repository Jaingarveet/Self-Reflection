Solution:
We are given that Tuesday is the only day George can present, so we assign him to Tuesday morning. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon presentation, so they are assigned to Monday and Wednesday mornings, respectively. 

If Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must give reports the next day. We can assign Nina to Tuesday afternoon, which frees up Helen and Irving for Wednesday morning and afternoon, respectively. 

With Kyle and Lenore not giving reports, the remaining students and days are matched as follows: Irving on Monday afternoon, Robert on Wednesday morning, and Helen on Wednesday afternoon. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
