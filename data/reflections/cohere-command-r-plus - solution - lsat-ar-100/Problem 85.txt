Solution:

We know that S must come before Y and that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. 

If we place S in the [REDACTED] position, Q can be second or [REDACTED], and Y can be [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED]. 

If we place S in the [REDACTED] position, Q can be second, [REDACTED], or [REDACTED], and Y can be [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED]. 

If we place S in the [REDACTED] position, Q can be second, [REDACTED], or [REDACTED], and Y can be [REDACTED] or [REDACTED]. 

If we put S in the [REDACTED] position, Q can be second, [REDACTED], or [REDACTED], and Y can be [REDACTED]. Note that in this scenario, G, H, or J can be [REDACTED], followed by R, and then we can have Q, S, and Y in that order. 

If we place S in the [REDACTED] (last) position, Y cannot be placed, contradicting the given conditions. 

Thus, S can take all positions except the [REDACTED].
