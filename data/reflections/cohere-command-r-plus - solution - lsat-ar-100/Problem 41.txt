Solution:
Given that Theresa tests G on the second day, it can be deduced that she tested H on the first day (as per the condition that she must be one of the testers for H). This means that G was tested by one of the other riders on the first day. 

Now, considering the remaining conditions: 
- Reynaldo cannot test F. 
- Yuki cannot test J. 
- The bicycle Yuki tests on the first day is of the same model as the one Seamus tests on the second day. 

Working through the options: 
[REDACTED]: If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, this would mean that Seamus would test either F or J on the first day, which is not necessarily a violation. However, this option can be set aside as it is not the only possible scenario. 
[REDACTED]: If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, this leaves Seamus to test F or H on the first day, neither of which violates the given conditions. However, this option can also be set aside for now as we continue evaluating other options. 
[REDACTED]: Theresa testing H on the second day is already established and not new information. 
[REDACTED]: If Theresa tests J on the first day, this implies that Seamus would test F on the first day, which violates the condition that Reynaldo cannot test F. This option can be eliminated. 
**[REDACTED]: If Yuki tests H on the second day, this means Seamus must test H on the first day to fulfill the condition related to Yuki's bicycle. This, in turn, means that Reynaldo must test J on the first day, as he cannot test F. This is the only option that fully satisfies all the conditions.**
