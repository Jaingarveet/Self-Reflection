Solution:

Given that Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, we can deduce the following:

- Wednesday morning: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] (must be on the same day)
- Wednesday afternoon: [REDACTED] (Lan cannot be on the same day)
- Thursday morning: [REDACTED] (must be before [REDACTED])
- Thursday afternoon: [REDACTED] (must be in the afternoon)
- Friday morning: Lan (by elimination)
- Friday afternoon: [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (by elimination, and they must be on the same day)

Therefore, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session, fulfilling the condition that his session occurs before [REDACTED]'s on Friday.
