Solution:
Given the constraints, we can deduce the following:
- Landon must be assigned to Zambia, as stated in the constraints.
- Ong can be assigned to Venezuela, as it is only stated that Kayne "cannot be assigned to Yemen" if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, which does not preclude other options.
- If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, Kayne must also be assigned per the constraints.
- Novetzke cannot be assigned per the constraints, as either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned.

Based on these deductions, we can determine that [REDACTED] are the pair of candidates who are not assigned to ambassadorships.
