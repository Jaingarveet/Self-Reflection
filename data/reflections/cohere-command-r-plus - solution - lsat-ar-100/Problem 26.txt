Solution:
To ensure that Wayne performs a modern piece before any traditional pieces, he can be assigned the second solo as a modern piece. This satisfies the condition and allows for the consecutive traditional pieces to be the third and [REDACTED]th solos. The fifth solo can then be a modern piece performed by Zara. This results in a minimum of [REDACTED] traditional pieces performed by Wayne, as all conditions are met without him performing any traditional solos.
