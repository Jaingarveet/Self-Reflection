Solution:
Given the conditions provided, let's break down the possible schedules for each cookie type: 
1. Oatmeal cookies: 
   - First batch: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
   - Second batch (made the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies): Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 
   - Third batch: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday 

2. Peanut butter cookies: 
   - First batch: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
   - Second batch: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday 
   - Third batch: Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday 

3. Sugar cookies: 
   - First batch: Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday 
   - Second batch: Thursday 
   - Third batch: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday 

Now, considering the condition that only one batch is made on Friday, we can deduce the following: 
- The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, as this would mean the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, resulting in two batches on Friday (the second batch of peanut butter cookies and the third batch of oatmeal cookies). 
- The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday, as this would mean the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, again resulting in two batches on Friday (the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the second batch of peanut butter cookies). 

Therefore, the only cookie batch that can be made on Friday is the third batch of sugar cookies. 

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios for the first batch of sugar cookies: 
- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, it satisfies all the conditions. The first batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, leaving Thursday for the second batch of sugar cookies and Friday for the third batch of sugar cookies. 
- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, it results in two batches being made on Friday, which goes against the given condition. 
- If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, it again results in two batches on Friday. 

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED]: The first batch of sugar cookies could be made on Monday, satisfying all the given conditions.
