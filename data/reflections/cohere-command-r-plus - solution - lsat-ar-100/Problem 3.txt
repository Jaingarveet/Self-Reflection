Solution:
Given that Robertson is assigned parking space #3, we can deduce the following:
1. Young must be assigned a higher number than #3. The only available higher number is #4.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher number than Souza. This could be #5 and #6 or vice versa.
3. Togowa and Vaughn are not subject to any specific conditions and can be assigned to the remaining spaces, #1 and #2, in either order.
4. Therefore, the only condition that must be true is that Young is assigned parking space #4, which is option [REDACTED].
