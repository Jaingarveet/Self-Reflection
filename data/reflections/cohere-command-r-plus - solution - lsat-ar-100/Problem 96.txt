Solution:

Given:
- On each of seven consecutive days, a pet shop features one of three breeds of kitten and puppy.
- Conditions: Greyhounds on day 1; no breed on consecutive days; day 1 breed absent from day 7; Himalayans on 3 days, not day 1; Rottweilers not on day 7 or Himalayan days.

If Himalayans are not on day 2:
- Day 1: Greyhounds (condition)
- Day 2: Not Himalayans (given)
- Day 3: Siamese (only option left)
- Day 4: Manx or Rottweiler
- Day 5: Options left: Manx or Rottweiler
- Day 6: One of: Himalayan, Greyhound, or Newfoundland
- Day 7: One of: Siamese, Manx, or Newfoundland (Himalayan and Rottweiler excluded)

Thus, if Himalayans are not featured on day 2, it is true that Siamese could be featured on day 4, making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.
