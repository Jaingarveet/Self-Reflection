Solution:

If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4 to fulfill the constraint of being next to each other. This means that one of the restaurants must be at the opposite end, in space 1 or 7, to satisfy the pharmacy's position and the requirement for separation between the restaurants. Therefore, it is true that a restaurant is in space 4, as it is the only option that fulfills all the constraints.
