Solution:
Given that P is the only zoologist selected, we know that at least two botanists must be chosen to fulfill the condition that there is "at most one zoologist" when there are "more than one botanist." 

The key constraint I overlooked is that F and K cannot both be selected. If F is selected, K cannot be, and vice versa. Now, let's consider the options: 
- If F is selected, G and H can be the other botanist, but we can't choose K as the chemist because of the constraint. 
- If G is selected, F and H can be the other botanist, and we still can't choose K. 
- The same applies if H is selected. 

In all cases, exactly two chemists can be selected, but F cannot be one of them due to the constraint with K. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED]"
