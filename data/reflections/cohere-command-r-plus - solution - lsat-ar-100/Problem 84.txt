Solution:
The conditions state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means K and O cannot be on the bottom shelf, eliminating choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. 

The condition, "F is placed on the same shelf as M," means that F and M must be on the same shelf. As a result, the only option that satisfies this condition is choice [REDACTED], with F, H, and M on the bottom shelf. 

The prompt also states that there must be at least two books on each shelf, and there are no restrictions that would prevent two books from being placed on the bottom shelf. 

Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
