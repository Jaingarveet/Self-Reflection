Solution:

Given that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, and that there are more in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we can deduce a ranked order of zones by the number of sales representatives: Zone 1 has the most, Zone 3 is second, and Zone 2 has the least. 

We also know the following pairings: 
- Parra and Quinn 
- Stuckey and Udall 

And the following conditions: 
- Either Parra or Tiao in Zone 1 
- Either Tiao or Udall in Zone 2 

If we place Parra and Quinn in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, this satisfies the given conditions. This means that Tiao must be in Zone 2, which is choice [REDACTED].
