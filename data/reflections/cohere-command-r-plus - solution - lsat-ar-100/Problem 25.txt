Solution:
Given that G is the fourth article, we can deduce the following:
- J must be before G, so it can be first or second.
- S must come before Y and cannot be adjacent to Q, so it can only be third.
- Q cannot be second, as this would violate the condition for S.
- H cannot be fifth, as this would mean two consecutive finance articles (H and G).
- Y can be sixth, as there are no restrictions on its placement other than it must come after S.

Thus, only option [REDACTED] is valid.
