Solution:
Given that P is performed third and S is performed sixth, we can make the following deductions: 
1. Composition T must be performed either in the fourth or fifth position, as it should be adjacent to F, and F cannot be in the fifth position due to the performance of P and S in the third and sixth positions, respectively. 
2. Composition O cannot be in the fifth position, as it can only be performed first or fifth, and the fifth position is not available per point 1. 
3. Composition F cannot be in the fifth position, as this would mean that R is performed before F, contradicting the condition that at least two compositions are performed between F and R. 
4. The fifth composition must be composition T, as this is the only option that satisfies all the conditions. It can be performed adjacent to F in the fourth or fifth position, and it does not violate any other conditions.
