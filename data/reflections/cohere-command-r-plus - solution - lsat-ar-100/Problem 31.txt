Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and determine the possible days for each cookie type: 
1. At least one batch is made on Monday, so this could be any one of the three kinds of cookies. 
2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on the same day. 
3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 

Now, let's analyze the options: 
- Option [REDACTED]: Oatmeal cookies could be Monday (first), Wednesday (second), and Thursday (third). Peanut butter cookies could be Wednesday (first), Thursday (second, with the second batch of oatmeal), and Friday (third). Sugar cookies could be Monday (first), Thursday (second), and Friday (third). This satisfies all the conditions. 
- Option [REDACTED]: This option was my previous choice, but it does not work because it violates the condition that the second batch of oatmeal and the first batch of peanut butter should be made on the same day. 
- Option [REDACTED]: This option does not work because it places the second batch of oatmeal cookies on Thursday, which is reserved for the second batch of sugar cookies. 
- Option [REDACTED]: This option violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day, as it places two batches of peanut butter cookies on Thursday. 
- Option [REDACTED]: This option also violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind are made on the same day, this time for oatmeal cookies on Thursday. 

Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.
