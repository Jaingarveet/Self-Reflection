Solution:
The provided rules dictate the showing order for houses J, K, L, and M, with some flexibility for houses N, O, and P. 

J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning, leaving the afternoon and evening as options. 

L must be shown after K and before M, restricting L to the afternoon or evening as well. 

M can be shown at any time as long as it is after L. 

N, O, and P can be shown in any order but must be shown after L and M. 

Therefore, a possible showing order could be: K and L in the afternoon, M in the morning, and J, N, O, and P in the evening. In this scenario, [REDACTED] is true as P is shown after J.
