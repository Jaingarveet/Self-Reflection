Solution:
[REDACTED]iven the conditions: 
- F and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected.
- [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected.
- If [REDACTED] is selected, [REDACTED] and R must also be selected.
- The panel must include at least one of each type of scientist.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then no more than one zoologist is selected. 

We are provided with four selected scientists: F, L, Q, and R. 

F is a botanist, so we already have one botanist on the panel. Q is a zoologist, so we have one zoologist as well. This leaves the chemist position to be filled by either [REDACTED] or L, as [REDACTED] cannot be selected without also selecting [REDACTED] and R, which would result in two zoologists (Q and R) and violate the given conditions. 

Therefore, the fifth scientist selected must be [REDACTED], as they complete the required trio of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and R, and L does not have any selection restrictions.
