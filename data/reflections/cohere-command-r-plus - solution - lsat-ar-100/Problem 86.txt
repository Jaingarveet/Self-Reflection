Solution:
Given that bay 4 holds produce, we can determine the following:
1. Bay 4 (produce) is determined.
2. Bay 3 or 5 must hold textiles as it is next to produce, but we cannot determine which bay without more information.
3. Bay 1, 2, or 3 could hold fuel as produce is higher-numbered, but we cannot be certain of the exact bay.
4. Machinery and livestock could occupy the remaining bays, but their positions are not fixed due to the limited information.
5. Bay 6 (livestock) is determined as it must be higher-numbered than textiles and produce.

Thus, for [REDACTED] bays (1, 4, 5, and 6), the type of cargo they are holding is completely determined.
