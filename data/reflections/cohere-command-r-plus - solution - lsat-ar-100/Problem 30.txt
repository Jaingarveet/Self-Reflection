Solution:
Given that the pianist who performs the first solo also performs the second solo, we know this pianist cannot be Wayne, due to condition 5. Therefore, the pianist must be Zara. Now, let's consider the remaining conditions:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece.
2. Exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece, or Zara performs a modern piece.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.

From condition 4, we know that Zara, who performed the second solo, cannot perform the fifth solo. Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
