Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and apply them step by step: 

1. Day 1 features Greyhounds.
2. No breed should be featured on two consecutive days. This means that day 2 cannot feature Greyhounds, but it doesn't restrict other pairings.
3. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days but not on day 1. This gives us flexibility in placing them on three non-consecutive days.
4. Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
5. Using the above conditions, we can deduce the following:
   - Day 2: Not Greyhounds, but no other restrictions.
   - Day 3: Cannot be Greyhounds or the breed featured on day 2.
   - Day 4: Cannot be Greyhounds, the breed from day 2, or Himalayans (as it would create consecutive days with the breed from day 3).
   - Day 5: Cannot be Greyhounds, the breed from day 3, or Himalayans (as it would create consecutive days with the breed from day 4).
   - Day 6: Cannot be Greyhounds, the breed from day 4, or the same pairing as day 5.
   - Day 7: Cannot be Greyhounds or any breed from day 1, and it cannot be Himalayans.

Given these deductions, we can see that choice [REDACTED]: Rottweilers and Manx on day 5 is a valid option. This choice doesn't violate any of the given conditions and provides a pairing that could be true within the context of the problem.
