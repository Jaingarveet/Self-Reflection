Solution:
The given rules and constraints are as follows: 
- J must be shown in the evening. 
- K cannot be shown in the morning. 
- L must be shown after K and before M. 

From these rules, we can deduce the following: 
- J is shown in the evening, which is the only option for its showing time. 
- K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening. 
- L must be shown after K, which narrows down its options to the afternoon or evening. 
- M must be shown after L. As L can only be shown in the afternoon or evening, this means that M can only be shown in the evening (after L) or afternoon (if L is shown in the evening). 

Now, let's consider the options: 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not a must; K can be shown in the afternoon, depending on the showing time of J. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This must be true because L has to be shown after K, and K cannot be shown in the morning. If K is shown in the afternoon, L must be shown afterward in the same time slot. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not a must as L can also be shown in the afternoon, maintaining the relative order with K. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This cannot be true because M can only be shown after L, and L cannot be shown in the morning due to the constraint on K. 
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This is not a must as M can also be shown in the evening, depending on when L is shown. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
