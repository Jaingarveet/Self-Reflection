Solution:

The conditions provided in the question are: 
 - Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
 - Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. 
 - Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. 
 - Hong does not testify on Monday (this does not imply that Hong testifies on Wednesday, as I initially assumed). 
 - At least one witness testifies on Monday. 

[REDACTED] valid schedule that meets these conditions is as follows: 

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| Franco | Garcia, Hong | Iturbe |
| Garcia | Franco, Jackson | Hong |
| Jackson | Franco, Garcia | Hong |

Now, evaluating each choice: 

- Choice [REDACTED]: Franco is the only witness on Monday in one of the valid schedules, so this can be true. 
- Choice [REDACTED]: Franco and Iturbe do not testify on the same day in any valid schedule, so this cannot be true. 
- Choice [REDACTED]: Garcia and Hong testify on Tuesday in one of the valid schedules, so this can be true. 
- Choice [REDACTED]: This choice is valid as it adheres to all the conditions. My error was in assuming that Hong testifying on Wednesday contradicted the condition that she doesn't testify on Monday. 
- Choice [REDACTED]: In all valid schedules, Jackson testifies on Tuesday, and there is always more than one witness scheduled for Monday. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.
