Solution:
Given that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can determine the following:
- Nessa must lead [REDACTED] of the afternoon sessions on Wednesday or Friday (Nessa afternoon constraint).
- Kevin and Rebecca must lead the other [REDACTED] Thursday sessions (Kevin and Rebecca same-day constraint).
- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on Thursday (Lan and Olivia different-day constraint). Lan must lead a morning session on Wednesday or Friday due to Nessa's afternoon session constraint.
- Olivia must lead the Friday session (Julio earlier day constraint).

So, we can determine which sessions [REDACTED] other lab assistants (Kevin, Rebecca, and Olivia) will lead, which is choice [REDACTED].
