Solution:

Given the conditions, we can deduce the following: 
1. Image's voicemail target is the shortest. 
2. Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's. 
3. None of the clients have a website target of 2 days. 

From this, we can determine that Solide's voicemail target could be shorter than Truvest's, as this does not contradict any of the given conditions.
