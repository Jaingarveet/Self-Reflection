Solution:
Given that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, we can deduce the following schedule:
- Oatmeal cookies: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- Peanut butter cookies: Tuesday, Thursday, not specified day
- Sugar cookies: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
Now, we can identify which two types of cookies are baked on each day:
- Monday: oatmeal and peanut butter
- Tuesday: peanut butter and sugar
- Wednesday: oatmeal and not specified
- Thursday: peanut butter and sugar
- Friday: oatmeal and sugar
Therefore, on Wednesday, two different kinds of cookies (oatmeal and an unspecified type) have their second batch made. 
The statement that "Two different kinds of cookies have their second batch made on Wednesday" is the only one that could be false.
