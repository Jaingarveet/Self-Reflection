Solution:

Given conditions: 
- Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
- Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
- Hong does not testify on Monday.
- At least one witness testifies on Monday.

If Franco and Hong testify on the same day:
- This day cannot be Monday as Hong does not testify on Monday.
- This day cannot be Wednesday as it is reserved for Iturbe.
- So, Franco and Hong must testify on Tuesday.

This means that Tuesday now has three witnesses: Franco, Hong, and one of the remaining two witnesses, Garcia or Iturbe. 

As a result, one of these remaining witnesses must testify on Monday, and the other on Wednesday to satisfy the given conditions. 

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
