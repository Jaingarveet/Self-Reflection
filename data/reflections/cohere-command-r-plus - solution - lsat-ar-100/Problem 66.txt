Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and determine the order step by step: 

1. "Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic": This means we need to alternate topics as much as possible. 
2. "S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third": This tells us that Q must be third, and S must come before it. 
3. "S must be earlier than Y": This condition was overlooked in my initial attempt. 
4. "J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R": This gives us a sequence of J, G, and R, but their exact positions are not yet fixed. 

Now, let's construct the order: 
1. We know Q must be third. 
2. S must come before Q, so S is second. 
3. Y must come after S, so Y is fourth. 
4. J, G, and R must fill the remaining spots, and since "J must be earlier than G," we can place them in the first, fifth, and seventh positions, respectively. 

The final order is: J, G, Q, S, Y, H, R. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as choosing [REDACTED] fixes the order and satisfies all the conditions.
