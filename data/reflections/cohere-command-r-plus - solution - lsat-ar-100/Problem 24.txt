Solution:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must be assigned. This implies a direct link between these two candidates. 

Choice [REDACTED] states that Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned. This also ensures a similar effect because it indirectly links Jaramillo and Kayne. If Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be, which means Kayne must be assigned due to the original constraint.
