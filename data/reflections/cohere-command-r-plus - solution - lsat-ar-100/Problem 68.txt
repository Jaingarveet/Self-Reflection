Solution:
Given that J must be earlier than G and that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, G must be placed after J with at least one article in between.
If J is third, G cannot be fourth, and there are only seven articles, so G must be placed fifth or sixth.
This placement satisfies the condition that G must be earlier than R as well.
Article S must be placed before article Y, and article Q can be placed third or later.
If we place S second, we can place Q third, and now we have a valid order: J-S-Q-G-[Nutrition]-Y-[Finance].
This order satisfies all the conditions, and Y is indeed fifth.
