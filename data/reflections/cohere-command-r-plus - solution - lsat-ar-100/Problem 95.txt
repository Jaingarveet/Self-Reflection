Solution:

The key clues to solving this problem are: 
1. The relative positions of the cargo types (e.g., livestock is in a higher-numbered bay than textiles).
2. The specific relationship between the produce and textiles bays ("next to" each other). 

Given that "textiles" and "produce" must be next to each other, and that "produce" is in a higher-numbered bay than "fuel," the only possible arrangement for the first three bays is: 
1. Fuel 
2. Machinery 
3. Textiles
