Solution:
The conditions in the question provide a framework for the order of the articles. 
Let's break down the conditions and their implications step by step:
1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic: This means we need to alternate between finance and nutrition articles, with the wildlife article fitting in between.
2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third: This condition does not restrict the placement of 'S' but rather provides a requirement for 'Q' to be third. 
3. S must be earlier than Y: This condition ensures that 'S' (nutrition) comes before 'Y' (wildlife).
4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R: This establishes a specific order for the finance articles.

Now, let's evaluate the options:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, as "G" is a finance article, and "H" or "J" must come before "R."
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This is possible if the first article is about wildlife, creating a valid order of Y, S, Q, J, G, R, H.
[REDACTED]: R is third - This is invalid as it violates the condition that G must come before R.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option is feasible, creating a valid order: Q, J, G, Y, S, H, R.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This satisfies all the conditions, and the order could be: Q, H, J, G, Y, S, R.
