Solution:
If Ong is assigned as the ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. This means that either Kayne is not an ambassador, or he is the ambassador to Zambia. 

If Kayne is not an ambassador, then Novetzke must be an ambassador to either Yemen or Zambia. From the first constraint, if Novetzke is an ambassador, then Jaramillo must also be one. This scenario leads to Answer [REDACTED], which is incorrect because it does not consider Landon's assignment to Zambia. 

Now, if Kayne is the ambassador to Zambia, then we have to consider the other constraints. From the first constraint, if Kayne is an ambassador, then Novetzke can also be one. In this case, Novetzke would be assigned to either Yemen or Venezuela. If Novetzke is assigned to Yemen, then, from the second constraint, Jaramillo cannot be an ambassador, and we have Answer [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
