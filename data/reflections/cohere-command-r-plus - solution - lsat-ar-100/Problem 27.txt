Solution:
Given constraints:
- Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane.
- Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian.
- Lopez and Megregian do not review any plays that Jiang reviews.
- Exactly two students review the same plays overall.

Lopez and Megregian cannot review Tamerlane together, as this would mean they review the same plays as Kramer and O'Neill, contradicting the constraint that exactly two students should have the same set of plays.

Jiang cannot review Tamerlane without overlapping with Lopez and Megregian, so Jiang also cannot be included.

Therefore, the accurate and complete list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill, choice [REDACTED].
