Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and analyze each choice: 

Conditions: 
- At least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist) must be included. 
- If there are multiple botanists (more than one), then there can be one or none zoologists. 
- F and K cannot be both selected. 
- K and M cannot be both selected. 
- If M is selected, both P and R must be on the panel as well. 

Analyzing the choices: 
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This selection includes F and K together, violating one of the given conditions. 

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option has two botanists and no zoologists, violating the condition about multiple botanists and the requirement to have at least one zoologist. 

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This selection satisfies all the conditions. It includes one of each type of scientist and does not violate any of the given restrictions. 

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This option includes two zoologists (P and R) and multiple botanists (F and G), which goes against the condition about selecting multiple botanists and zoologists. 

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - While this choice includes the required types, it violates the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must be present. 

So, the correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
