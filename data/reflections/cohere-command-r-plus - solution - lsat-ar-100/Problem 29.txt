Solution:

Given that L is on a higher shelf than H, we know that O must be on a higher shelf than L. This means that O is on either the top or middle shelf. 

I is already placed on the middle shelf, so there is only one spot left on that shelf. K must be placed higher than F, so K and O cannot be on the same shelf as each other (choice [REDACTED] is incorrect). 

The top shelf now has two books: O and one other book. This leaves four books for the bottom shelf, which has the most books. 

We know that F and M are on the same shelf, and this could be either the top or bottom shelf. 

If F and M are on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf has H, G, I, and K, meaning that choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are correct and choice [REDACTED] is incorrect. 

However, if F and M are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf has H and G, the middle shelf has I, and the bottom shelf has F, G, M, and K, which means that choice [REDACTED] is correct, and choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are incorrect. 

Therefore, the final answer is [REDACTED].
