Solution:
Given that Theresa tests J on the first day, we can deduce the following: 
1. Yuki tests H on the first day (as per the condition that Theresa must test H, and Yuki cannot test J). 
2. On the second day, Seamus tests H (as per the condition that the bicycle Yuki tests on the first day is tested by Seamus on the second). 
3. This leaves bicycles F and G for Reynaldo and Seamus on the first day. 
4. Since Reynaldo cannot test F, he tests G on the first day, leaving bicycle F for Seamus. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: Seamus tests H on the first day**.
