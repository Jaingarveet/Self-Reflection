Solution:
The conditions provided in the question offer a set of constraints that must be satisfied by the correct answer. Let's break down the relevant information and rules step by step: 

1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1. 
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. This means there can be no immediate repetitions in our sequence. 
3. Any breed featured on day 1 (Greyhound) cannot be featured on day 7. 
4. Himalayans are featured exactly three times but not on day 1. This means we need to place 'Himalayan' in our sequence three times, ensuring it doesn't appear on day 1. 
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 or on any day that features Himalayans. This means we can't place 'Rottweiler' on day 7 or on the same day as 'Himalayan'. 

Now, let's construct a sequence that satisfies these conditions: 

Day 1: Not Himalayan or Rottweiler due to condition 3 and 5. Let's place 'Siamese'.
Day 2: Cannot be Siamese due to condition 2. Let's place 'Himalayan' here as it needs to appear 3 times. 
Day 3: Cannot be Greyhound due to condition 1, Himalayan due to condition 2. Let's place 'Manx'.
Day 4: Cannot be Manx due to condition 2. 'Siamese' can be placed here. 
Day 5: Cannot place Himalayan as it would violate condition 2 and 5. 'Rottweiler' can be placed here. 
Day 6: Cannot place Rottweiler due to condition 2. 'Manx' can be placed here. 
Day 7: Cannot place Greyhound (condition 3), Himalayan (condition 5), or Rottweiler (condition 5). 'Siamese' can be placed here. 

This gives us the sequence: 

Siamese, Himalayan, Manx, Siamese, Rottweiler, Manx, Siamese

This sequence satisfies all the given conditions, making choice [REDACTED] the correct answer.
