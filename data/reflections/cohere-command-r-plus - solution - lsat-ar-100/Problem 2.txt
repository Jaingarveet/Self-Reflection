Solution:
The original constraint states: "The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses." 

This constraint ensures that there is a minimum distance of two spaces between the two restaurants, regardless of the specific businesses occupying those spaces. 

Now, let's re-evaluate the choices: 
- Choice [REDACTED] specifies spaces 3, 4, or 5 for a restaurant, but this does not guarantee the required separation of two spaces between the restaurants.
- Choice [REDACTED] suggests a restaurant next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, but this does not ensure the separation of two spaces between the restaurants.
- Choice [REDACTED] mentions the toy store or veterinarian between the restaurants, but again, this does not guarantee the required separation of two spaces.
- **Choice D** indicates that there can be no more than two businesses between the pharmacy and the nearest restaurant, which effectively enforces the same requirement as the original constraint. This choice ensures that there are at least two spaces between the restaurants, as having more than two businesses would violate the constraint.
- Choice [REDACTED], regarding the optometrist and shoe store, does not relate to the placement of the restaurants and thus cannot have the same effect as the original constraint.
