Solution:
If S is performed fourth, then the first composition cannot be O, as O is performed either first or fifth. 
This eliminates choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], as they have O as the first composition. 
Now, let's consider the conditions: 
1. T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
2. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
3. O is performed either first or fifth.
4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
5. P is performed at some time before S.
6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.

Choice [REDACTED], [REDACTED] satisfies all the conditions:
1. T can be placed later, satisfying condition 1.
2. There are two compositions (P and R) between F and R, satisfying condition 2.
3. O is the first composition, satisfying condition 3.
4. H or L can be the eighth composition, satisfying condition 4.
5. P is performed before S, satisfying condition 5.
6. S is performed after P and before O, satisfying condition 6.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice [REDACTED].
