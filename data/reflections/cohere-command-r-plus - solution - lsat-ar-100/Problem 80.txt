Solution:
Step 1: Assign Togowa and Souza to parking spaces #2 and #5, respectively, to satisfy the conditions that Xu and Young are assigned higher numbers. 
Step 2: Assign Xu a higher number than #5, which is #6. 
Step 3: Assign Young a higher number than Togowa's #2, which can be #3, #4, #5, or #6. In this case, #3 is suitable as it is higher than Togowa's #2 and satisfies the condition that Robertson is assigned a higher number. 
Step 4: Assign Robertson #4, a higher number than Young's #3, and meeting the condition that Robertson is assigned #1-#4. 
Step 5: Finally, assign Vaughn the remaining #1, as none of the conditions are violated.
