Solution:
Let's break down the conditions and build the schedule step by step: 

1. Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, so we place him on Tuesday. 
2. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. We can schedule them for morning slots. 
3. Nina's report: if given, Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, unless it's Wednesday. This means Nina can be scheduled for Monday or Tuesday, with Helen and Irving on Tuesday or Wednesday, respectively. 
4. We have some flexibility with the remaining students, Kyle and Lenore. 

[REDACTED] possible schedule that meets all the conditions is: 

Monday morning: Lenore
Monday afternoon: Helen
Tuesday morning: George (only option)
Tuesday afternoon: Irving
Wednesday morning: Nina
Wednesday afternoon: Robert

This schedule ensures that exactly six students give reports over three days, with two reports each day.
