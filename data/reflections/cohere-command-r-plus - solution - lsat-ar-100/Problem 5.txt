Solution:

The conditions provided in the question offer a set of constraints that narrow down the possible arrangements of the books on the shelves. 

Given that: 
1. "O is placed on a higher shelf than L" 
2. "F is placed on the same shelf as M" 
3. "K is on a higher shelf than F" 

We can deduce the following: 

As F and M are on the same shelf, they must be considered together as a unit. K, being on a higher shelf than F, eliminates the possibility of K being on the middle shelf, as that would violate the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf (assuming I and F/M are already on the middle shelf). 

This leaves only two options for K: the top or bottom shelf. Placing K on the bottom shelf would also place it below O, which contradicts the condition that O is higher than L (and, by extension, F/M). 

Therefore, K must be on the top shelf. This automatically places O on the middle shelf, as O cannot be on the same shelf as I or K (given their respective placements). 

With this arrangement, we can see that O is indeed placed on a higher shelf than M, satisfying the conditions provided.
