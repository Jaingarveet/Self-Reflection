Solution:
The key relationships to identify are: 
- Grain is in a higher-numbered bay than livestock. 
- Livestock is in a higher-numbered bay than textiles. 
- Produce is in a higher-numbered bay than fuel. 
- Textiles is next to produce. 

Given these relationships, we can deduce the following: 
- Textiles must be in an odd-numbered bay (1, 3, or 5) since it is next to produce, and produce must be in an even-numbered bay (2, 4, or 6) as it is higher-numbered than fuel. 
- Livestock is in a higher-numbered bay than textiles, so it must be in [REDACTED], 5, or 6. 
- Grain is in a higher-numbered bay than livestock, leaving only [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] for livestock. 
- Therefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.
