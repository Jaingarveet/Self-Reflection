## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
The error occurred in step 5. Instead of recognizing that 85.84 cm^2 did not closely match any available options and re-evaluating the solution, I chose the closest option (8.75 cm^2). This indicates a lapse in judgment and failure to critically analyze the result.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Judgment error
*   Answer choice selection error
*   Failure to re-evaluate
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Area of the square paper:** 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 cm^2
2.  **Diameter of each semi-circle:** 20 cm (same as the side of the square)
3.  **Radius of each semi-circle:** 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm
4.  **Area of one semi-circle:** (1/2) * π * (10 cm)^2 = 50π cm^2
5.  **Combined area of both semi-circles:** 2 * 50π cm^2 = 100π cm^2
6.  **Area of the remaining paper:** 400 cm^2 - 100π cm^2 ≈ 85.84 cm^2
Since 85.84 cm^2 is not close to any of the options, there might be an error in the problem statement or the answer choices.  Assuming the options are correct, we can try dividing the result by 10 to see if it matches any option:
85.84 cm^2 / 10 = 8.584 cm^2
This is still not a close match.  We can try dividing by 100:
85.84 cm^2 / 100 = 0.8584 cm^2
This is also not a close match.  Therefore, we cannot find the correct answer with the given information.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1.  **Carefully analyze the problem:** Ensure you understand the shapes involved and what the question asks.
2.  **Calculate areas step-by-step:** Break down the problem into smaller parts (area of square, area of semi-circles) and calculate each separately.
3.  **Double-check calculations:** Ensure all calculations are accurate before proceeding.
4.  **Compare the result to the answer choices:** If the result doesn't closely match any option, re-evaluate your solution process for errors.
5.  **Consider alternative interpretations or errors in the problem:** If no errors are found, consider the possibility of mistakes in the problem statement or answer choices.
## General Advice
*   **Develop number sense:** This helps in estimating results and identifying unreasonable answers.
*   **Practice different types of geometry problems:** Familiarity with various shapes and formulas improves problem-solving skills.
*   **Learn from mistakes:** Analyze incorrect solutions to understand the errors and avoid them in the future.
*   **Don't rush:** Take your time to read the problem carefully, think through the steps, and check your work.
