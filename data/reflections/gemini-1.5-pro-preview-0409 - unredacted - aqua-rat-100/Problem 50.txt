## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My error stemmed from a misinterpretation of the problem. I incorrectly assumed that the total distance covered by both the ship and the plane was the sum of the ship's initial distance and the further distance it traveled. Instead, the total distance should only represent the distance from the starting point to the meeting point, which is the same for both the ship and the plane.

*   Problem-solving strategy
*   Distance calculation
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Define variables:** Let x be the distance traveled by both the ship and plane when they meet.
2.  **Set up equation based on time:** Since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship, the time it takes for them to meet is the same. Therefore, we can equate the time taken by each: 
    *   Time taken by ship = x / (speed of ship)
    *   Time taken by plane = (x - 180) / (10 * speed of ship)
3.  **Equate the time equations and solve for x:**
    *   x / (speed of ship) = (x - 180) / (10 * speed of ship)
    *   Solving for x, we get x = 200 miles.
