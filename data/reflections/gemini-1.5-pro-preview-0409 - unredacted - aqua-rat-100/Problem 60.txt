Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of "B bisects minor arc AC." I incorrectly assumed it meant B was the midpoint of arc AC, dividing it into two equal arcs. However, it actually means that line segment AB bisects the angle formed by arc AC, not necessarily dividing the arc length equally.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Geometry terminology
 - Angle bisector vs. midpoint
Solution:
1. Since B bisects minor arc AC, angle ABC = 160°/2 = 80°.
2. Angle ABC is an inscribed angle, so it intercepts an arc twice its measure. Therefore, minor arc AC = 2 * 80° = 160° (which we already knew).
3.  Minor arc AB = 160°/2 = 80° (since B bisects arc AC).
4.  Minor arc CD = minor arc BD - minor arc BC = 150° - 80° = 70°.
5.  Minor arc AD = minor arc AB + minor arc BD = 80° + 70° = 150°.
Instructions:
1. Understand the concept of an angle bisector in the context of circles and arcs. Remember that it bisects the angle, not necessarily the arc length.
2. Recall the relationship between inscribed angles and the arcs they intercept: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
3. Break down the problem into smaller parts: find the measures of individual arcs (AB, BC, CD) based on the given information and relationships.
4. Combine the measures of relevant arcs to find the measure of the desired arc (AD).
Advice:
- Pay close attention to the specific wording of geometry problems, especially terms like "bisect" which can have different meanings depending on the context.
- Review key geometric concepts and relationships, such as those between angles and arcs in circles.
- Draw a clear diagram to visualize the problem and relationships between different parts of the circle.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure your answer is consistent with the given information and geometric principles.
