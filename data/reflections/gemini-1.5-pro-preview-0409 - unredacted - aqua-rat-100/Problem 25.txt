## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My error stemmed from a mistake in calculating the time taken to cover the remaining distance. I incorrectly substituted the value of 'h' in the equation for time, leading to the wrong answer.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Calculation error
*   Algebraic manipulation error
*   Substitution error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Set up equations:** As before, we have `tan 60° = h/y`, `tan 45° = h/x`, leading to `y = h/√3` and `x = h`.
2.  **Distance covered:** The distance covered in 10 minutes is `x - y = h(1 - 1/√3)`.
3.  **Time equation:** We know `distance = speed × time`. So, the time taken to cover the remaining distance y is `time = distance/speed = y/v = (h/√3)/v`.
4.  **Relate time and distance:** We need to express the time in terms of the known 10 minutes. We know `10 minutes = h(1 - 1/√3)/v`. Solving for v, we get `v = h(1 - 1/√3) / 10`.
5.  **Substitute and solve:** Substitute the value of v in the time equation: `time = (h/√3) / (h(1 - 1/√3) / 10)`. Simplifying, we get `time = 10 / (√3 - 1)`.
6.  **Rationalize the denominator:** Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: `time = 10(√3 + 1) / ((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))`. This simplifies to `time = 5(√3 + 1) minutes`.
## Instructions for Future
1.  **Carefully set up equations based on the given information and trigonometric relationships.**
2.  **Clearly define variables and maintain consistent notation throughout the solution.**
3.  **Double-check all algebraic manipulations and substitutions to avoid errors.**
4.  **Pay close attention to units and ensure consistency in calculations.**
5.  **Rationalize denominators when necessary to simplify expressions.**
