## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial assumption that using a combination of single and double letter codes would be the most efficient was incorrect. I failed to consider that using only single letter codes would be sufficient and more efficient.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Assumption error
*   Optimization error
*   Combinatorics error 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Single Letter Codes:** We have 26 letters in the alphabet, which is more than enough to assign a unique single letter code to each of the 10 types of books. 
Therefore, the minimum number of letters needed is **10**.
## Instructions for Future Similar Problems
1. **Analyze the Problem:** Carefully read and understand the problem requirements and constraints.
2. **Consider All Options:** Explore different approaches and possibilities for creating the codes.
3. **Evaluate Efficiency:** Compare the efficiency of different methods, considering the number of available symbols and the number of codes needed.
4. **Choose the Optimal Solution:** Select the method that uses the least number of symbols while fulfilling the requirements.
