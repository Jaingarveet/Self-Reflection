## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My approach was partially correct, but I only considered the inner cube and neglected the unpainted faces between the inner and outer layers.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Incomplete analysis
*   Neglecting internal faces
*   Three-dimensional geometry visualization error
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Outer Cube:** The outer cube has 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 small cubes.
2.  **Inner Cube:** Removing the outer layer leaves a 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 small cube core.
3.  **Unpainted Cubes:** The number of unpainted cubes is the difference: 125 - 27 = 98 cubes.
4.  **Unpainted Faces:** Each unpainted cube has 6 faces, so there are 98 x 6 = 588 unpainted faces.
5.  **Subtracting Exposed Faces:** However, some of these faces are exposed to the outside and painted. We need to subtract these. 
    *   Each face of the inner cube has 9 exposed faces (3x3 grid). 
    *   Since there are 6 faces on the inner cube, we have 6 x 9 = 54 exposed faces to subtract.
6.  **Total Unpainted Faces:** Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is 588 - 54 = 534.
## Instructions for Future
1.  **Visualize the Structure:** Clearly visualize the 3D structure of the cube and its layers.
2.  **Consider All Layers:** Don't just focus on the inner or outer layer; consider the unpainted faces between them.
3.  **Calculate Unpainted Cubes:** Find the difference between the total number of cubes and the inner cube's cubes.
4.  **Account for Exposed Faces:** Remember to subtract the exposed faces of the inner cube that are painted.
## General Advice
*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Practice visualizing and manipulating 3D objects in your mind.
*   **Break Down Complex Shapes:** Divide complex shapes into simpler components for easier analysis.
*   **Consider All Surfaces:**  When dealing with painted surfaces, consider all sides and potential hidden faces. 
*   **Review and Learn:** Analyze mistakes to understand the reasoning gaps and avoid them in the future.
