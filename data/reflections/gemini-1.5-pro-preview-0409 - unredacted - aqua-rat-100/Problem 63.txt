Explanation:
I made two errors in solving this problem. First, I incorrectly assumed that the number of wins represented 70% of the total matches. Second, I rounded the total number of matches up to the nearest whole number, which is not appropriate in this context.
Error Keywords:
 - Percentage calculation error
 - Rounding error
 - Assumption error
Solution:
The team lost 30% of their matches, so they won 100% - 30% = 70% of their matches.
Let x be the total number of matches played.
We can set up the equation: 0.7x = 20 matches (70% of the total matches equals the number of wins)
Solving for x, we get: x = 20 matches / 0.7 = 28.57 matches.
Since a team cannot play a fraction of a match, we know the total number of matches must be a whole number less than 28.57. Therefore, the total number of matches is 28.
The number of losses is 30% of 28 matches, which is 0.3 * 28 matches = 8.4 matches.
Again, since a team cannot lose a fraction of a match, we round 8.4 down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the team lost 8 matches. 
Instructions:
1. Identify the percentage of matches the team won.
2. Calculate the percentage of matches the team lost.
3. Set up an equation representing the relationship between the percentage of matches won and the actual number of matches won.
4. Solve the equation to find the total number of matches.
5. Round the total number of matches down to the nearest whole number, if necessary.
6. Calculate the number of matches lost based on the percentage of matches lost and the total number of matches.
7. Round the number of matches lost down to the nearest whole number, if necessary.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the information given in the problem and avoid making assumptions.
 - Be mindful of rounding; round only when necessary and in the appropriate direction.
 - Remember that percentages can be converted to decimals and used in calculations.
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem. 
 - Consider alternative approaches to solving the problem to verify your answer.
