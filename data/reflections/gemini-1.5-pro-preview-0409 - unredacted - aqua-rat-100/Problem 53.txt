## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
While the algebraic approach and equations were set up correctly, there might have been an error during the solving process, leading to the incorrect values for A and S.  Double-checking the calculations is crucial in such problems.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Algebraic manipulation error
*   Equation solving error
*   Calculation error
## Solving the Problem
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Set up equations:**
    *   Equation 1: \(2(A-30) = S+30\)
    *   Equation 2: \(3(S-10) = A+10\)
2.  **Solve Equation 1 for S:** 
    *   \(S = 2A - 90\)
3.  **Substitute S in Equation 2:**
    *   \(3(2A-90-10) = A+10\)
    *   \(6A - 300 = A + 10\)
4.  **Solve for A:**
    *   \(5A = 310\)
    *   \(A = 62\)
5.  **Substitute A in the equation for S:**
    *   \(S = 2(62) - 90\)
    *   \(S = 34\)
Therefore, Arjun has **$62** and Sajal has **$34**.
