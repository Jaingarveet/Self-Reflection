## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** I misinterpreted the problem by assuming the 25% profit was based on the cost price, not the selling price. This led me to calculate the profit per bag incorrectly and consequently, the number of bags sold.

*   Profit calculation error
*   Percentage base confusion 
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Profit based on Selling Price:** We know the profit is 25% of the selling price, which is $100. So, the profit per bag is 0.25 * $100 = $25.
2.  **Cost Price Calculation:** If the selling price is $100 and the profit is $25, then the cost price per bag is $100 - $25 = $75.
3.  **Total Profit and Cost:** The total profit is $3,000. So, the total cost for all bags is $3,000 (profit) / 0.25 (profit margin) = $12,000.
4.  **Number of Bags Sold:** To find the number of bags, we divide the total cost by the cost per bag: $12,000 / $75 per bag = 160 bags. 
5. **Adjust for Selling Price:** Since the profit is based on the selling price, we need to adjust the number of bags. We know the total selling price is 160 bags * $100/bag = $16,000. 
6. **Final Calculation:**  To find the number of bags based on the selling price and profit, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag: $3,000 / $25 per bag = 120 bags. 
Therefore, the grocer sold **120 bags of flour**.
