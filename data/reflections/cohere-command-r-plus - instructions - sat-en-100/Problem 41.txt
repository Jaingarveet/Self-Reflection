Instructions:
1. Understand the mechanism described in Hodick and Sievers's model: two trigger hair stimulations are required to produce a high enough calcium concentration to close the trap. 
2. Identify the key condition in the model: both stimulations must occur within a short time frame to maintain a high calcium concentration. 
3. Analyze each choice: 
   - [REDACTED]: Contradicts the model as it suggests one stimulation can produce enough calcium to close the trap. 
   - [REDACTED]: Correct; inactivity leads to diminished calcium, and a second stimulation may not be enough to reach the threshold. 
   - [REDACTED]: Describes the mechanism in the model but does not provide a scenario where the trap doesn't close. 
   - [REDACTED]: Within the timeframe suggested, the trap is likely to close according to the model. 
4. Select the choice that presents a scenario contradicting the model's prediction.
