Instructions:
1. Identify the potential criticism of Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model. 
2. Refer back to the relevant section of the passage: "Subsequent research supports this model." This indicates that the correct answer will likely involve a discrepancy between Volkov's findings and the model. 
3. Examine each choice carefully, focusing on how they relate to the model and Volkov's experimental results. 
4. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because there is no indication that Volkov misunderstood the model. 
5. Choice [REDACTED] is correct because it highlights a potential discrepancy between Volkov's measurements and the model. While Volkov successfully induced the trap to close, he did not directly measure calcium levels, leaving room for doubt about the model's accuracy. 
6. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because it focuses on the method of direct electrical stimulation, which is not the central issue. The question asks for a potential criticism based on the results, not the methodology. 
7. Choice [REDACTED] is incorrect because it is irrelevant to the model's accuracy or Volkov's findings. The availability of technology does not impact the validity of the criticism.
