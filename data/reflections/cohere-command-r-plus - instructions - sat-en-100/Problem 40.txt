Instructions:
1. Examine the narrator's interactions with unfamiliar people: In this case, note their initial shyness and formal tone with Father and Big Uncle.
2. Pay attention to social cues and body language: The narrator's shy voice and squinting suggest a level of discomfort or reservation.
3. Consider the narrator's motivations: They want to describe their observations to GaoLing, but this does not negate their reserved nature around new people.
4. Look for keywords or phrases: Phrases like "shy voice," "squinted at me," and "I tried to notice everything" indicate a level of reservation and attention to detail.
5. Reflect on the broader context: The narrator is entering a new environment and interacting with unfamiliar relatives, which can evoke a sense of reservation or caution.
