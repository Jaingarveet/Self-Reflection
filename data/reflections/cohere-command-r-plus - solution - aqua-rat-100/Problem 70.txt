Solution:
The main line train service starts at 5:00, so the first train arrives at 5:00, and the second arrives at 5:10. 
The harbor line train service starts at 5:02, so the first train arrives at 5:02, and the second at 5:12. 
We want to find the probability of the man catching the first train of the day on either line. 

The probability of catching the first train = 1 - (probability of missing both first trains)
The probability of missing the first main line train = 0.1 (as it arrives every 10 minutes)
The probability of missing the first harbor line train = 0.02 (as it arrives 2 minutes after the hour)

The probability of missing both first trains = 0.1 * 0.02 = 0.002
So, the probability of catching the first train = 1 - 0.002 = [REDACTED]98
The closest value to this is [REDACTED]9, which is choice [REDACTED].
