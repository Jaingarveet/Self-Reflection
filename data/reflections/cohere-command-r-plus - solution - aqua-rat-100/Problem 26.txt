Solution:
The total area of the rectangle is 27 cm x 17 cm = 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. When the rectangle is rebent into a square, the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the square is also 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. 

To find the length of one side of the square, we divide the area by the length of one side: 
45[REDACTED] sq. cm / side = side^2

side^2 = 45[REDACTED]
side = √45[REDACTED] ≈ 21.4 cm

Since we need an integer side length, we round down to the nearest integer: 21 cm.
