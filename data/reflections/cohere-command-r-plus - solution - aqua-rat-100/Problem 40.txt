Solution:

Let's assume John has x amount of money. 

According to Mark, if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, from Mark's perspective: 
John's contribution = 1/2 * x
Mark already had: 75 - (1/2)x

According to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs. 75. So, from John's perspective: 
John's original amount + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75
This can be written as: x + (1/3)(2x - 75) = 75

Now, we can solve for x: 
75 = x + (2/3)x - 25
75 = (5/3)x - 25
100 = (5/3)x
x = [REDACTED]
