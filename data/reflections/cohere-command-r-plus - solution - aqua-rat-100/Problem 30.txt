Solution:
The time interval between each tablet consumption is 15 minutes. 
To find the total time to consume all 5 tablets, we recognize that '15 minutes' is a quarter of an hour, and therefore, 5 tablets will take 5 * 15 minutes = 5 * 1/4 hours = 5/4 hours.
Converting this fraction to minutes, we get 5/4 hours * 60 minutes = 75/4 minutes = 18.75 minutes.
So, the correct answer is 75 minutes, or choice [REDACTED].
