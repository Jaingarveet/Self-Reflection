Solution:
The frog starts at a depth of 30 meters. 
Each day, it climbs up 3 meters and slips down by 2, so its net gain is 1 meter. 
To get out of the well, it needs to climb 30 meters. 
This will take 30 net gains, or jumps. 
However, we must also account for the initial slip of 2 meters on the first day, which means it will take 32 total jumps to get out. 
Therefore, it will take 32 days.
