Solution:
The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile. 

Let's calculate the cost for distances varying by a quarter-mile, starting from 1 quarter-mile and ending at 35 quarter-miles (9 miles), with a step of 1 quarter-mile. 

1/4 mile: $3.50
2/4 miles: $3.60
...
34/4 miles: $7.40
35/4 miles: $7.50

With a budget of $8.50, we can afford the fare up to 35/4 miles, which is equivalent to 8.75 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], including the initial quarter-mile.
