Solution:
We want Susan to be on the left of Tim, which means Susan can occupy either the leftmost or the middle chair. There are [REDACTED] options for Susan. Once Susan's position is fixed, there are [REDACTED] children left to be seated, and they can be arranged in [REDACTED] ways. Hence, there are a total of $[REDACTED] \times [REDACTED] = 4$ arrangements.

However, one of these arrangements does not follow the constraint as it places Susan to the right of Tim. So, we subtract [REDACTED] from the total to get $4-[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]$ valid arrangements.
