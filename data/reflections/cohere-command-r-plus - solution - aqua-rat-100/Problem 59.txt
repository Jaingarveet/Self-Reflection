Solution:
There are 20 black marbles in the bag after the second round. 
The probability of pulling out a black marble the second time is still 1/20. 
This probability represents the ratio of black marbles to all marbles in the bag. 
So, we set up the equation: 1/20 = 20/Q. 
Solving for Q, we get Q = [REDACTED]0.
