Solution:
There are [REDACTED] choices for the first point and 4 choices for the second point. For the third point, there are 3 choices, and for the fourth point, there are 2 choices. The number of ways to choose 4 out of [REDACTED] points is calculated as [REDACTED] x 4 x 3 x 2 = [REDACTED]0. However, this includes quadrilaterals with intersecting sides, which cannot be formed. 

There are 4 choices for the first point ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], D), and for the second point, there are 3 choices ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], D). The third point has 2 choices, and the fourth point is determined. This results in 4 x 3 x 2 = 24 quadrilaterals with intersecting sides. 

To find the total number of valid quadrilaterals, subtract the intersecting ones from the total: [REDACTED]0 - 24 = 96. 

Now, we need to consider the quadrilaterals that include point F. There are [REDACTED] choices for the three remaining points, resulting in [REDACTED] valid quadrilaterals that include the center point. 

Therefore, the final count of unique quadrilaterals is 96 + [REDACTED] = **[REDACTED]1**.
