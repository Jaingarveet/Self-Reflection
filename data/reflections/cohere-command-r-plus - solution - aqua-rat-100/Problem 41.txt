Solution:
Original contribution = Rs. 96 / n 

After 4 friends did not show up: 
New contribution = Rs. (96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 144 / (n-4) 

We set up the equation: 
Rs. 144 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4 

Multiplying both sides by (n-4) yields: 
144 = 96 + 4n 

Subtracting 96 from both sides: 
4[REDACTED] = 4n 

Dividing by 4: 
n = [REDACTED] 

The number of friends who attended the picnic is n = [REDACTED].
