Solution:
Let's call the man's monthly income 'x'. 
He saves 12.5% of 'x', which is 0.125x, and this amount is not spent. So, his expenses are Rs. 3500, and his income is x. 

We can set up the equation: 
x - 0.125x = Rs. 3500 

Now, simply solve for x: 
0.875x = Rs. 3500 
x = Rs. 3500 / 0.875 
x = [REDACTED]
