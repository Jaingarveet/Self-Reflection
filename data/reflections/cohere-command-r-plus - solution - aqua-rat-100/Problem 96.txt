Solution:
Let [REDACTED] join x months after [REDACTED].
A's profit for the first [REDACTED] = Rs. 40,000 * (2/12) = Rs. 6,667
A's profit for the remaining 10 months = Rs. 40,000 * (10/12) * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000
A's total profit for the year = Rs. 6,667 + Rs. 75,000 = Rs. 81,667
B's profit for (12-x) months = Rs. 60,000 * (12-x)/12 * (375,000/220,000) = Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12
C's profit for x months = Rs. 150,000
Equation: 
A's profit + B's profit + C's profit = Total profit
Rs. 81,667 + Rs. 75,000 * (12-x)/12 + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000
Simplifying the equation:
Rs. 81,667 + Rs. 6,250 * (12-x) + Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 375,000
Solving for x, we get x = 4
