Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step: 

1. We know that the area of each triangle is $70$ square feet, and we want to find the area of the original square. Since the diagonal cut divides the rectangle into two equal triangles, we know that the area of the rectangle is also $70 \times 2 = 140$ square feet. 

2. Now, we need to find the side length of the original square. The rectangle formed after trimming the square has dimensions $x$ and $x-4$, where $x$ is the side length of the original square. We know that the area of the rectangle is $140$ square feet, so we can set up the equation: 
   $x(x-4) = 140$ 

3. Solving the quadratic equation, we find that $x = 12$. This is the side length of the original square. 

4. To find the perimeter of the square, we multiply the side length by $4$: 
   $4 \times 12 = \text{[REDACTED] feet}$. 

So, the correct answer is $\text{[REDACTED] feet}$.
