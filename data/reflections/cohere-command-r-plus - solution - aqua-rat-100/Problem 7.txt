Solution:
Amy needs to create unique codes for [REDACTED] different types of books. She can use either a single letter or a pair of letters. 

The simplest way to do this is to use the first [REDACTED] letters of the alphabet for the single-letter codes: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], F, G, H, I, J. 

This would leave [REDACTED] letters unused: K, L, M, N. 

With these remaining letters, she can create 6 pairs of letters where order does not matter: KL, KM, KN, LM, LN, MN. 

Therefore, Amy only needs enough letters for these codes, a total of [REDACTED] letters: the first [REDACTED] letters of the alphabet.
