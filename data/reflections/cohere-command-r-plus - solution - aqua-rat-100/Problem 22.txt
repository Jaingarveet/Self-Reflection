Solution:
Given that Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours and they made a total of 35 toys, we can assume they worked for a similar duration. 

Let's calculate the number of hours each person worked, considering their individual rates: 
For Alex: 
 - Hours worked = 7 hours/toy * Toys made = 7 * 35 = 245 hours 

For Jacob: 
 - Hours worked = 9 hours/toy * Toys made = 9 * Total toys made by Jacob = 9 * unknown

We know they worked for almost the same number of hours, so: 
 - 245 hours (Alex) ≈ 9 * Toys made by Jacob 

Now, we can solve for the number of toys made by Jacob: 
 - Toys made by Jacob ≈ 245/9 ≈ 27.2 

Since Jacob cannot make a fraction of a toy, he made 27 toys. 

So, Jacob made [REDACTED] toys, which is choice [REDACTED].
