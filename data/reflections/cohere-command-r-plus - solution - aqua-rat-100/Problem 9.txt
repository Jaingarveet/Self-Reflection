Solution:
Profit = 25% of Selling Price = 0.25 * $100 = $25
Cost Price = Selling Price - Profit = $100 - $25 = $75
Total Cost Price for all bags = Cost Price * number of bags = $75 * number of bags = $[REDACTED]00
Number of bags = $[REDACTED]00 / $75 = [REDACTED] bags

Number of bags sold = [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
