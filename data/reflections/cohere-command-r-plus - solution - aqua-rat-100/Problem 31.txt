Solution:
For the first 19 months, an average of 42 microwave ovens were sold per month. 
So, a total of 19 * 42 = 798 microwaves were sold.
In the next 10 months, an average of 20 microwave ovens were sold per month. 
Thus, a total of 10 * 20 = 200 microwaves were sold.
In the total 22 months, 798 + 200 = 998 microwaves were sold.
To find the average number of sales per month, divide the total number of microwaves sold (998) by the number of months (22). 
998 / 22 = 45.36, which rounds to 45.
The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22-month period is 45.
