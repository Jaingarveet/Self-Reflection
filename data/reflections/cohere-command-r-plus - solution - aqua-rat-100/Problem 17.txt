Solution:

The company produces 420 units of the component monthly, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5040 components. 

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must exceed the production costs by this amount. 

Total production costs are 5040 * $110 = $554,400 

So, the total sales revenue required is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800 

Now, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: 

$1,180,800 / 420 = $[REDACTED]0 / 9 = $311.11 (rounded to the nearest cent) 

So, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
