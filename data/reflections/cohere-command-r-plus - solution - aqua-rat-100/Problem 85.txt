Solution:
Given:
- Walking 20 steps at an unknown speed results in a total time of 10 minutes.
- Walking 10 steps at the same unknown speed results in a total time of 20 minutes.

Let the speed of the elevator be 'x' steps/minute.

For 20 steps:
Time = (20 steps / x steps/minute) + extra time at a speed of x

For 10 steps:
Time = (10 steps / x steps/minute) + extra time at a speed of x

According to the question, the total time for 10 steps is twice the total time for 20 steps:
2 * (20/x + extra time) = 20

Simplifying:
40/x + 2 * extra time = 20

Subtracting (2 * extra time) from both sides:
40/x = 10

Multiplying both sides by x:
40 = 10x

Dividing both sides by 10:
x = 4 steps/minute

Therefore, the correct answer is '[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]'.
