Solution:
Cost price = Rs. 1200
Desired profit % = 20%
Discount offered = 20%

Let the marked price of the sewing machine be Rs. x

To make a 20% profit, Karan should sell the machine for 120% of its cost price: 
1200 * 120/100 = Rs. 1440

Now, we calculate the price after a 20% discount: 
1440 * 80/100 = Rs. 1152

So, the marked price, Rs. x, should be set to Rs. 1440 to achieve a 20% profit, and even after offering a 20% discount, he will sell the machine for Rs. 1152.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: Rs. [REDACTED]
