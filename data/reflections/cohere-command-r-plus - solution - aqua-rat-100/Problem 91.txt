Solution:
[REDACTED] travels 3 km south, 5 km east, 3 km north, and 2 km west. The net displacement to the south and north cancels out, leaving [REDACTED] 3 km to the east and 2 km to the north of the starting point. These displacements are not perpendicular, so we calculate them separately. Thus, [REDACTED] is 3 km away from home.
