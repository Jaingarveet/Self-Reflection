Solution:

Let the distance traveled be 'D' km. 

The speed for the first journey = D/6 km/hr 

The speed for the second journey = (D/4) km/hr 

It is given that the two speeds are equal, so we can set up the equation: 

D/6 = D/4 - 12 

Multiplying by 12 to clear the fractions and simplify: 

4[REDACTED] = 3[REDACTED] - 72 

Adding 72 and 3[REDACTED] to both sides: 

4[REDACTED] + 3[REDACTED] + 72 = 0 

Combining like terms: 

7[REDACTED] + 72 = 0 

Isolating [REDACTED]: 

[REDACTED] = -72/7 

[REDACTED] = -10.29 (incorrect; this is not a valid answer)
