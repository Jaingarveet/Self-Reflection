Solution:
Let X be the total number of students at Daifu University. 
24% of students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and [REDACTED] of the swim team members are not members of the chess club. 

First, we calculate the percentage of students who are members of only the swim team: 
0.20 * 0.24X = 0.048X are in the swim team but not the chess club. 

The remaining percentage of students who are in both clubs is: 
0.24X - 0.048X = 0.192X 

So, the total number of students in the swim team is: 
0.24X + 0.192X = 0.432X 

Therefore, the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team is: 
(0.432X / X) * 100 = 43.2%.
