Solution:
Given that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] (as minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED]). 
To find minor arc B[REDACTED]: 
minor arc B[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] 
minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] 
minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]. 

Now, to find minor arc A[REDACTED]: 
minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] 
minor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] 
minor arc A[REDACTED] = 240°. 

The measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is 240°, which is greater than 1[REDACTED] (half the circle). This indicates that minor arc A[REDACTED] is actually a major arc, and its measure as a minor arc is the complementary angle, which is 1[REDACTED] - 240° = 40°. 

So, minor arc A[REDACTED] = 40°.
