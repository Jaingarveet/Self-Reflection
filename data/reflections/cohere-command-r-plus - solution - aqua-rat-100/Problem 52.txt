Solution:
Given: 
Alloy X = Zn:Cu = 6:9 
Alloy Y = Zn:Cu = 7:11 
Alloy Z = (40g of X) + (60g of Y) 

Calculations: 
Weight of Z = 40 + 60 = 100g 
Weight of Zn in Z = (6/15 * 40) + (7/18 * 60) = 46g 
Weight of Cu in Z = (9/15 * 40) + (11/18 * 60) = 54g 

Now, to find the correct ratio: 
Zn:Cu = 46:54 

To simplify, we can find the common factor: 
Common factor = 2 (found by factoring 46 and 54) 

Simplified ratio: 
(46 รท 2):(54 รท 2) = 23:27 

To convert this into the required format: 
Multiply both parts by 11 to get whole numbers: 
 (23 * 11):(27 * 11) = 253:297 

This can be simplified further: 
253:297 reduces to [REDACTED] by taking the common factor of 11 

Final answer: [REDACTED] 

Choice [REDACTED] is correct.
