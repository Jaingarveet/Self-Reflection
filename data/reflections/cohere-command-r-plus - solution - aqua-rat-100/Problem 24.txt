Solution:
The average of the highest and lowest scores is x, so the sum of the highest and lowest scores is 2x. 
Excluding these two scores, we have z - 2 students left in the class. 
The sum of their scores is equal to zy - 2x. 
To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we divide this sum by the number of students: (zy - 2x) / (z - 2).
