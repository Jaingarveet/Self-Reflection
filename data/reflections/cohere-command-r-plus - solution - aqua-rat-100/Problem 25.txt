Solution:
Let's denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as $x$. Using trigonometry, we can set up the following equations:
$\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = h$
$\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10} \implies h = (x - 10)\tan(60^{\circ})$

Setting these equations equal to each other and solving for $x$, we get:
$x = h = (x - 10)\tan(60^{\circ})$
$x = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)$

Now, we can find how much farther the car has to travel:
$x - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} - 2 + 1) = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1 - 2) = 5(\sqrt{3} - 1)$

Therefore, it will take $\mathbf{5(\sqrt{3} - 1)}$ more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is choice $\mathbf{A}$.
