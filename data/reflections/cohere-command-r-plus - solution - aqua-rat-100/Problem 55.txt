Solution:
Let the man's rate along the current be "x" kmph and the current's rate be "y" kmph.
We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:
x - y = 2 (the man's rate against the current)
x + y = 4 (the man's rate in still water)

Adding these equations, we get:
2x = 6
x = 3

Substituting x into the equation x + y = 4:
3 + y = 4
y = 1

Now, we can find the man's rate along the current:
x = 3 kmph

Therefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: 3 kmph**.
