Solution:
The initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls, totaling 104 members. During the drive, an equal number of boys and girls joined to establish a new ratio of 4:3 (boys to girls). 

To find the total number of members now, we can use the ratio: 
Total members = (4/7) * Initial members 
Total members = (4/7) * 104 
Total members = [REDACTED]
