Solution:
The cow is tethered in the middle and moves in a circular pattern, but the area grazed is square-shaped. The square's side length is half of the rope length, so it's 7 feet. The area of the square field is 7*7 = 49 square feet. Therefore, it will take 49 / 10 = **4.9 days** for the cow to graze the whole field. The closest answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.
