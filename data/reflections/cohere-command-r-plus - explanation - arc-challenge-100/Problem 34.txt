Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and jumped to a conclusion. I focused on the phrase "limited testing" and assumed that the next logical step would be to expand the testing to humans. However, the question asks for a way to "strengthen their conclusions," implying that the focus should be on the validity and reproducibility of the existing results rather than immediate expansion to human trials.
