Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and applied an incorrect rule of natural selection. I assumed that the introduction of a predator would favor the traits of light wool and smaller size, leading to a decline in the dark-wool sheep population. However, the correct interpretation is that the presence of any predator, regardless of the specific traits it targets, will initially reduce the overall number of sheep, which are now easier prey. This results in a decrease in the population of light-wool sheep, as they were previously the dominant population on the island.
