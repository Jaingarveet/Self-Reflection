Explanation:

We are given the equation $(a x + 2)(b x + 7) = 15 x^2 + c x + 14$ for all values of $x$, and $a + b = 8$. We want to find the possible values of $c$.

First, we can simplify the equation by subtracting $15x^2$ from both sides:

$$cx + 14 = (a x + 2)(b x + 7) - 15x^2$$

Now, we can multiply both sides by $a x + 2$:

$$ac = (b x + 7)(a x + 2) - 15x^2$$

Now, we can simplify the equation further by multiplying both sides by $b x + 7$:

$$ac = (b x + 7)^2 - 15x^2$$

Since the left-hand side is a perfect square, we know that $c$ must be an integer. Therefore, the possible values for $c$ are:

$$c = 0, 1, 15, 35, 41$$

So, the two possible values for $c$ are $31$ and $41$. Therefore, the answer is (D): $c = 31$ or $c = 41$.
