Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I correctly identified that $r = [REDACTED]$ based on the given equation $3r = 18$, but then I made an error in my calculation for $[REDACTED]r + 3$.

The correct calculation for $[REDACTED]r + 3$ is:

$[REDACTED]r + 3 = [REDACTED]([REDACTED]) + 3 = [REDACTED]$

So, the correct answer is (D) $[REDACTED]$.
