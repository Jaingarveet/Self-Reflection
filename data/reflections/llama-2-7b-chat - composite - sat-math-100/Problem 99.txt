Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. I incorrectly identified the value of $f([REDACTED])$.

The correct calculation is:

$$f([REDACTED]) = \frac{[REDACTED] + 3}{[REDACTED]} = \frac{-4}{[REDACTED]} = [REDACTED]$$

So, the correct answer is (C) $f([REDACTED]) = [REDACTED]$.

Error Keywords:

* Plugging in incorrect values
* Miscalculation
* Error in simplification

Solution:

To find the value of $f([REDACTED])$, we need to plug $[REDACTED]$ into the formula for $f(x)$:

$$f([REDACTED]) = \frac{[REDACTED] + 3}{[REDACTED]}$$

Step-by-step calculation:

[REDACTED]. Subtract $3$ from $[REDACTED]$ to get $[REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Divide by $[REDACTED]$ to simplify the fraction.

Therefore, $f([REDACTED]) = [REDACTED]$.

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Identify the function $f(x)$ and its formula.
[REDACTED]. Plug in the value $[REDACTED]$ into the formula for $f(x)$.
3. Simplify the fraction and calculate the result.
4. Double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always check your work by plugging in different values and verifying the results.
* Be careful when simplifying fractions, as small mistakes can lead to incorrect answers.
* Make sure to read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
