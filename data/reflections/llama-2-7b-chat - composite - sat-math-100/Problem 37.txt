Explanation:
I correctly identified the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder (V = πr^2h) and applied it to the problem. However, I made an error in my calculation.

Error Keywords:

* Calculation error
* Formula application error
* Radius miscalculation

Solution:
The volume of the first cylinder is [REDACTED] cubic centimeters.
The radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.
The height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.
Using the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:
V = π(1/2)^2 \* 2h = π \* 1/4 \* 2 \* [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] cubic centimeters

Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for the volume of a right circular cylinder.
2. Apply the formula to the problem, using the given information.
3. Calculate the volume of the second cylinder using the formula and the given information.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:

* Always use the correct formula for the problem, and apply it correctly.
* Always calculate each subproblem step-by-step, and double-check your calculations.
* Always use the correct units for the problem, and make sure they are consistent throughout the calculation.
* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before starting the calculation.
