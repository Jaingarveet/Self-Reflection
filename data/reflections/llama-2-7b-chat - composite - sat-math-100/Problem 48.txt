Explanation:

You have correctly solved the system of equations and found that $x = y - \frac{1}{2}$.

The correct answer is (B): [REDACTED]

Explanation of the reasoning:

You were given two equations:

3x + b = 5x - 7
3y + c = 5y - 7

where b and c are constants. If b = c - $\frac{1}{2}$, then we can solve for x and y using the first equation:

3x + b = 5x - 7
3x = 5x - 7 + b
3x = 12

Now, substituting this value of x into the second equation:

3y + c = 5y - 7
3y = 5y - 7 + c
3y = 12 + c

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 12 + c / 3

Now, you were given the following choices:

[REDACTED]: x is y minus 1/4
[REDACTED]: x is y minus 1/2
[REDACTED]: x is y minus 1
[REDACTED]: x is y plus 1/2

You correctly identified that the correct answer is (B): [REDACTED]

Well done!
