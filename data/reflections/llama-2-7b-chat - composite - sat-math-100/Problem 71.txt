Explanation:

The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED].

To find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never," we can use the conditional probability formula:

P(A|B) = P([REDACTED] ∩ B) / P(B)

where:

* P(A) is the probability of answering "Always"
* P(B) is the probability of not answering "Never"
* P([REDACTED] ∩ B) is the probability of answering "Always" and not answering "Never"

From the table, we can see that:

* P(A) = 0.30 (from the last column)
* P(B) = [REDACTED] (from the first column)
* P([REDACTED] ∩ B) = 0.30 x [REDACTED] = 0.207

So, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never," is:

P(Always|Never) = P(A|B) = 0.207

The correct answer is (C) [REDACTED].

Advice:

* When dealing with conditional probability problems, make sure to use the correct formula and to isolate the probability of the event of interest.
* Always check your calculations to ensure that they are correct.
* In this problem, it was important to use the information that the probability of not answering "Never" was [REDACTED] to find the probability of answering "Always" given that the user did not answer "Never".
