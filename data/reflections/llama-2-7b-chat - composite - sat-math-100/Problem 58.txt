Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and answer.

The correct answer is (A) [REDACTED].

If $(0,0)$ is a solution to the system of inequalities, it means that the line $y = -x + a$ intersects the line $y = x + b$ at the point $(0,0)$. Since $y > x + b$ at this point, we have $b > a$.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the problem
* Incorrect reasoning
* Wrong answer

Solution:

1. Identify the lines given in the problem: $y = -x + a$ and $y = x + b$.
2. Find the point of intersection between the two lines: $(0,0)$.
3. Check the inequality conditions at the point of intersection: $y > x + b$ and $y < -x + a$.
4. Determine the relationship between $a$ and $b$ based on the inequality conditions: $b > a$.

Instructions:

1. Always read the problem carefully and understand the given information.
2. Break down complex problems into simpler steps and check each step for accuracy.
3. Use visual aids, such as graphs or diagrams, to help with problem-solving.
4. Verify your answers by checking the inequality conditions at the point of intersection.
5. Always choose the answer that best explains the reasoning and solution.

Advice:

* Practice solving similar problems to improve your understanding of mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills.
* Review and reinforce your knowledge of basic mathematical operations and principles, such as linear equations and inequalities.
* Use visual aids and diagrams to help visualize and solve problems.
* Check your work and verify your answers to ensure accuracy and confidence in your solutions.
