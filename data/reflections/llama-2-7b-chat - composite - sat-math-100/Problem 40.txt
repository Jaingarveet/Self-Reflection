Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly solved the equation $20-x=1[REDACTED]$ and arrived at the wrong answer.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the equation
* Incorrect calculation
* Failure to check work

Solution:
The equation $20-x=1[REDACTED]$ can be solved by subtracting $x$ from both sides of the equation:

$20 - x = 1[REDACTED]$
$x = [REDACTED]$

Therefore, the value of $3x$ is $[REDACTED]: 1[REDACTED]$.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the given information and the unknown variable.
3. Use the given information to solve the equation.
