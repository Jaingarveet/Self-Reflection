Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation, leading to the incorrect answer.

Error Keywords:

* Substitution error
* Calculation error
* Misunderstanding the problem

Solution:

The correct solution is:

$$y = x^[REDACTED]$$

Substituting this expression into the second equation:

$$[REDACTED]y + 6 = [REDACTED](x + [REDACTED])$$

Simplifying and solving for $y$:

$$y = x^[REDACTED] + [REDACTED]x + 6$$

Since $(x, y) = ([REDACTED], 4)$, we have:

$$x y = [REDACTED] \times 4 = 8$$

Therefore, the value of $x y$ is $8$.

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Identify the equations given in the problem.
[REDACTED]. Substitute the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation.
[REDACTED]. Simplify and solve for $y$.
4. Identify the value of $x y$.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated value.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the given equations.
* Always use the correct substitution and simplification techniques.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Pay close attention to the units of measurement when solving mathematical problems.
