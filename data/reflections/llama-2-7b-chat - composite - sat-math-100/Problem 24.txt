Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly solved the problem and provided an answer that is incorrect.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Incorrect calculation
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:
To find the value of $n$ such that $|n-[REDACTED]| + [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]$, we need to isolate the absolute value of $n-[REDACTED]$ on one side of the equation and then add [REDACTED] to both sides.

Step-by-step solution:

[REDACTED]. Isolate the absolute value of $n-[REDACTED]$ on one side of the equation by using the absolute value symbol: $|n-[REDACTED]| = n-[REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Add [REDACTED] to both sides of the equation: $n-[REDACTED] + [REDACTED] = n$.
3. Simplify the equation: $n = [REDACTED]$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
[REDACTED]. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Work through each step of the solution carefully and accurately.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
5. Always choose the answer that best fits the problem and the given choices.

Advice:

* Always approach math problems with a clear and focused mindset.
* Take your time and work through each step of the problem carefully and accurately.
* Use visual aids, such as diagrams or graphs, to help you understand the problem and solve it.
* Practice, practice, practice to improve your math skills and increase your confidence.
