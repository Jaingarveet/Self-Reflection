Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly identified the coordinates of the $x$-intercepts and applied the wrong formula to find the distance between them.

Error Keywords:

* Misidentification of coordinates
* Incorrect formula application

Solution:
The correct coordinates of the $x$-intercepts are ([REDACTED], 9) and ([REDACTED], [REDACTED]0).

Using the formula:
Distance = √(y[REDACTED] - y[REDACTED])

Distance between the $x$-intercepts = √([REDACTED]0 - 9) = √[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

Instructions:

[REDACTED]. Identify the coordinates of the $x$-intercepts of the graph of $f(x) = x^{[REDACTED]} + 5x + [REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Use the formula: Distance = √(y[REDACTED] - y[REDACTED]) to find the distance between the $x$-intercepts.
[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always carefully identify the coordinates of the points in a problem.
* Always use the correct formula and apply it correctly.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
