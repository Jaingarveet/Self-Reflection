Explanation:

The problem asks us to find the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y. To do this, we need to use the total number of dreams recalled by each group.

From the table, we can see that Group X recalled 36 dreams, and Group Y recalled 125 dreams. So, the total number of dreams recalled is 161 (36 + 125).

Now, let's find the number of dreams recalled by Group Y alone:

Group Y recalled 68 dreams.

So, the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{68}{161}$$

This is the correct answer, so we should choose option (B) on the multiple-choice question.
