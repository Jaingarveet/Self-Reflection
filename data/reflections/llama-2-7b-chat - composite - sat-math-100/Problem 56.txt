Explanation:
I correctly identified the value of $g(-4)$ as [REDACTED].

Error Keywords:

* None

Solution:
The function $g(x) = a x^2 + 24$ can be factored as $a (x + 4)^2$.

Plugging in -4, we get:

$g(-4) = a (-4 + 4)^2 = a [REDACTED]^2 = [REDACTED]$

Therefore, the value of $g(-4)$ is [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Identify the function $g(x)$ and its formula.
2. Plug in -4 into the function $g(x)$.
3. Simplify the expression to find the value of $g(-4)$.
4. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always identify the formula of the function and simplify it to find the solution.
* Always check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that the value of a function at a point is equal to the value of the function at that point multiplied by the coefficient of the variable.
