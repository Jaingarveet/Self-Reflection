Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Growth rate misunderstanding

Solution: Step-by-step calculation: 
An average growth rate of 6 cm per year (within the 5-7 cm range) is a conservative estimate. 
Average growth rate per year = 6 cm
Total time period = 4 years

Average gain in length over 4 years = Average growth rate per year * Number of years
Average gain in length = 6 cm/year * 4 years = 24 cm

Since we are looking for the average gain in length, we can round this to the nearest multiple of 5, which is [REDACTED]. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.
