Solution: Pyloric stenosis is a condition that leads to the narrowing of the pylorus, the passage connecting the stomach and the small intestine. This obstruction can cause a backup of stomach contents, resulting in a distended stomach. The classic X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis is the single bubble appearance, which reflects this distension.
