Solution: Step-by-step reasoning: 
1. The internal carotid artery supplies blood to the brain and its surrounding structures. 
2. The cavernous part of the internal carotid artery is a specific segment of this vessel. 
3. This segment gives rise to several branches, including:
   - [REDACTED]: Supplies blood to the cavernous sinus and surrounding structures. 
   - [REDACTED]: Supplies blood to the pituitary gland. 
   - [REDACTED]: Supplies blood to the eye and surrounding structures. 
4. The meningeal artery is not a direct branch of the cavernous part of the internal carotid artery. It arises from the middle meningeal artery, which, in turn, originates from the maxillary artery. 
5. Therefore, the correct answer is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]." The ophthalmic artery is not a branch of the cavernous part but, instead, arises directly from the internal carotid artery before it divides into its segments.
