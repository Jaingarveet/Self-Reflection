Explanation:
I misread the question and did not pay attention to the context of the text. 
The text describes a man in the kitchen putting seasonings into a pan and swishing it around. 
Option [REDACTED] is completely unrelated to the context of the text. 
Option [REDACTED] is the most likely completion of the text as it introduces a series of small videos of foods and mentions "Steve's cooking."
