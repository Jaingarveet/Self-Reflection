Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED] because it seemed to provide additional information about the benefits of using calamine lotion or witch hazel. However, the text did not ask for additional information, but rather the most likely completion to the text. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the most likely completion because it provides a clear and concise statement that both calamine lotion and witch hazel work well, and it includes a substep to not rub the lotion or witch hazel into the chilblains.
