Advice:
 - Understand the goal of statistical sampling: to make inferences about a population from a representative subset. 
 - Always consider the potential for bias in your sampling method. 
 - Recognize that in this case, representation is key: each store should contribute to the sample to ensure an unbiased estimate. 
 - Avoid methods that introduce bias, such as self-selection or non-random sampling. 
 - Remember that the goal is to estimate the proportion across all stores, not to understand satisfaction within a single store or among specific employee groups.
