Explanation:
I made an error in my evaluation of the options.
I incorrectly stated that Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza in option [REDACTED], but in fact, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza in option [REDACTED].
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my evaluation of the options.
I knew the correct rules but made an evaluation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Evaluation error
 - Option analysis error
 - Rule violation error

Solution:
Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

Option [REDACTED]: Young is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the first rule.
Option [REDACTED]: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Robertson's parking space is not #1, #2, #3, or #4, which violates the fourth rule.
Option [REDACTED]: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, but Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza, which violates the second rule.
Option [REDACTED]: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and all other rules are satisfied.
Option [REDACTED]: Robertson is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, and Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, and all other rules are satisfied.

Instructions:
1. Identify the rules that govern the assignment of parking spaces.
2. Evaluate each option against the rules.
3. Eliminate any options that violate the rules.
4. Choose the option that satisfies all the rules.
5. Work step-by-step through your evaluation of each option.
6. Double-check your evaluation of each option to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your evaluated option.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your evaluation of each option and final answer.
 - Remember that the rules must be satisfied for all options, not just some.
 - Be careful not to make assumptions about the options; evaluate each option based on the rules.
