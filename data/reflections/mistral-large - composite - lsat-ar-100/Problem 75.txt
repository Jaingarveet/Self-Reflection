Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of plays Megregian reviews.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the conditions but made an incorrect inference.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Since Kramer and [REDACTED] each review fewer plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.
Since neither [REDACTED] nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang must review only one play, which cannot be Tamerlane since Kramer and [REDACTED] both review it. Therefore, Jiang must review only Sunset.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and [REDACTED] both review Tamerlane, [REDACTED] must review only one play, which cannot be Tamerlane or Sunset. Therefore, [REDACTED] must review only Undulation.
The only student who could review only Sunset is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.
2. Use logical reasoning to infer the possible plays each student could review.
3. Eliminate the plays that cannot be reviewed by a student based on the conditions.
4. Identify the student who could review only Sunset based on the conditions.
5. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
6. Double-check your inferences to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your inferred result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your inferences and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving law problems.
