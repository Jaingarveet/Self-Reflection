Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the distribution of plays among the students.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the correct conditions but made an incorrect inference.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane, Jiang must review either Sunset or Undulation.
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, they cannot review the play Jiang reviews.
Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, Megregian must review at least two plays.
Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, Megregian must review the same play as either Kramer or O'Neill.
Therefore, Megregian must review Tamerlane.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.
2. Identify the plays that each student can or cannot review based on the conditions.
3. Identify the minimum and maximum number of plays each student can review based on the conditions.
4. Identify the plays that must be reviewed by at least two students based on the conditions.
5. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
6. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your logical conclusion.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions that are not supported by the given conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a systematic process that requires careful analysis and deduction.
