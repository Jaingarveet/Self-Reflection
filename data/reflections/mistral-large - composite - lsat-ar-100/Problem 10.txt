Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not carefully consider the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my understanding of the problem requirements.
I made an assumption that the organizer would select more French novels than Russian novels, which was not necessarily true.
