Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the constraint that "Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day" to mean that they must lead both morning and afternoon sessions on the same day.
Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of constraints
 - Logical reasoning error

Solution:
If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead a session on Friday. Since Nessa must lead an afternoon session, Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they can lead either the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions or the Thursday morning and afternoon sessions.
Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, so Lan must lead the Wednesday evening session.
Therefore, we can determine the sessions for Julio, Olivia, and Lan.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints of the problem.
2. Determine the possible sessions for each lab assistant based on the constraints.
3. Consider all possible scenarios for each lab assistant.
4. Eliminate scenarios that violate the constraints.
5. Determine the number of lab assistants for whom a specific session can be determined.
6. Work step-by-step through your logical reasoning.
7. Double-check your reasoning and final answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions about the problem without verifying them.
 - Always consider all possible scenarios for each variable.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that constraints can limit the possible scenarios for each variable.
