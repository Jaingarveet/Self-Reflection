Solution: Given that none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, we can deduce the following:
- Image has the shortest voicemail target of 1 day, and its website target must be longer, so it is set to 2 days.
- Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's, so it could be 1 or 2 days. Its voicemail target is 2 days, as it cannot be shorter than Image's.
- Truvest's website target must be longer than Solide's, so it could be 2 or 3 days. Its voicemail target is 1 day, as it cannot be longer than its website target.

Thus, the statements that must be true are:
- [REDACTED]: Image's website target is 2 days (not 1 day).
- [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
- [REDACTED]: Truvest's website target is 2 or 3 days.
- [REDACTED]: Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day.

The statement that cannot be true is:
**[REDACTED]: Solide's website target is not necessarily 2 days; it could also be 1 day.**
