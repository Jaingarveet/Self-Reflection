Solution: Given that Kramer and O'Neill both review "Tamerlane," and exactly three students review "Undulation," we can deduce the following:

- Lopez and Megregian cannot review "Tamerlane" as it would result in three students having the same play in common, contradicting the clue that there should only be pairs.
- This leaves "Sunset" to be reviewed by Kramer and Lopez, ensuring that Megregian and Jiang can take the remaining spots for "Undulation."
- Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: O'Neill reviews Sunset, along with Kramer.
