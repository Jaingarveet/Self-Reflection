Solution: Given that Jackson testifies on Monday and Hong cannot testify on Monday, Hong must testify on Tuesday. With two witnesses testifying on Tuesday, and Franco and Garcia not testifying on the same day, it must be the case that Franco and Garcia testify on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. This leaves Monday with Jackson and Wednesday with Iturbe and Franco.
