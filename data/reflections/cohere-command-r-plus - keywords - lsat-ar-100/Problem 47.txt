Solution: Given that Image's website target is 2 days, we can deduce the following:
- [REDACTED] must be 1 day, as it is specified to be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, and the options are limited to 1, 2, or 3 days.
- [REDACTED] can be 1 or 3 days. It cannot be 2 days because that would make it equal to Image's website target, and it must be shorter than [REDACTED].
- [REDACTED] can now be determined to be either 2 or 3 days. It must be longer than Solide's, and the only options remaining are 2 or 3 days.
- [REDACTED] can be 1, 2, or 3 days. It simply needs to be longer than [REDACTED], which is 1 day.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as it must be 1 day, leaving the website target at 2 days.
