Solution: Given that Kramer and Lopez review fewer plays than Megregian, and Kramer and O'Neill both review "Tamerlane," we can deduce the following:

- Kramer and O'Neill have two plays in common: "Tamerlane" and one other play, let's call it "Play X."
- Megregian must also review "Play X" since exactly two students have the same play selection.
- Lopez cannot review "Tamerlane" or "Play X" as that would make three students with the same play selection.
- This leaves "Sunset" and "Undulation" for Lopez and Jiang to review.
- Since Jiang doesn't review "Tamerlane," they must review either "Sunset" or "Undulation." However, we cannot determine the specific play Jiang reviews, as it could be either.
- Therefore, the correct answer is not provided in the options.
