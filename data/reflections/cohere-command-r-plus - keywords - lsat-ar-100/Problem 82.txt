Solution: Given that Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone, and either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, we can place Parra and Quinn in Zone 1, and Tiao in Zone 2 (satisfying the condition that Tiao can work in Zone 2). This leaves Udall to work in Zone 2 as well, and the remaining representatives, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey, in Zone 3.
