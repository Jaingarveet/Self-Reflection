Explanation:
I incorrectly recalled the recommended daily dose of iron and folic acid for pregnant women under the MCH program. While I correctly remembered the folic acid dose of 500 mcg, I mistakenly thought the iron dose was 60 mg instead of the correct 100 mg. This error was due to a gap in my knowledge of the specific dosage recommendations.
Error Keywords:
- Incorrect recall

Under the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) program, pregnant women are given daily iron and folic acid supplements to prevent anemia and neural tube defects in the developing fetus.
The recommended daily dose for pregnant women is 100 mg of elemental iron and 500 mcg of folic acid.
This combination is essential for the proper growth and development of the fetus and the well-being of the mother.
