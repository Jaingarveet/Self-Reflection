Advice:

* Always evaluate arguments based on evidence and reasoning, rather than making assumptions.
* Be aware of common logical fallacies and avoid them in your own reasoning.
* Consider alternative perspectives and evidence that may challenge your assumptions.
* Avoid making conclusions without sufficient evidence or reasoning.
