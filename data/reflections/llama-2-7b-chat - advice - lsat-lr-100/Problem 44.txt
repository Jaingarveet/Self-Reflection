Advice:

* Be aware of the affirming the antecedent fallacy, which occurs when a conclusion is based solely on the premise that the antecedent is true without considering any evidence or reasoning that might contradict the conclusion.
* Always consider alternative explanations and evidence that may contradict the conclusion.
* Avoid making assumptions about a conclusion based solely on the premise that the antecedent is true.
* Look for evidence and reasoning that supports the conclusion, rather than simply assuming it based on the premise.
