Advice:
When analyzing arguments, it is important to identify the assumptions and inferences made, and to evaluate whether they are supported by evidence and reasoning. In this case, the argument relies on an unjustified inference, and therefore is vulnerable to criticism.

In general, it is important to consider alternative explanations and to evaluate arguments based on their logical coherence and evidence support. By doing so, you can develop a more nuanced understanding of the issue and make more informed judgments.
