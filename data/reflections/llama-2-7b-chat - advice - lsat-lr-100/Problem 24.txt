Advice:

* Be cautious of arguments that make generalizations based on a minority of cases.
* Always consider the possibility that the minority may not represent the majority.
* Avoid making conclusions about a group based on a single example or a limited number of examples.
* Look for evidence that supports the conclusion, rather than relying on assumptions or generalizations.
* Consider alternative explanations for the observed phenomenon.
