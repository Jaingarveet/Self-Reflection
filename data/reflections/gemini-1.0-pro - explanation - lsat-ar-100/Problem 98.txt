Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the houses shown in the afternoon must be shown in the order L, M, N. However, the rules only state that L must be shown before M, not necessarily in the afternoon. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in legal reasoning but in logical reasoning. 
I knew the correct rules but made an illogical assumption.
