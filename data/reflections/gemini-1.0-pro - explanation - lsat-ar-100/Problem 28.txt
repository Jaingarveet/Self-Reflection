Explanation:
[REDACTED]y initial analysis was correct up to the point where I concluded that [REDACTED] could not be selected. I overlooked the fact that if [REDACTED] is not selected, then [REDACTED] and R must also not be selected. This oversight led me to incorrectly conclude that [REDACTED] must be the fifth scientist selected.
Error [REDACTED]eywords:
- Overlooking a condition
- Incomplete analysis
- Incorrect conclusion
