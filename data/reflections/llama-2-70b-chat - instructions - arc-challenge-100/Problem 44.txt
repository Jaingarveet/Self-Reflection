Instructions:
1. Identify the forces acting on the car: force of gravity and force of friction.
2. Understand that the force of friction is greater than the force of gravity, causing the car to slow down.
3. Recognize that the conversion of kinetic energy to potential energy is not the main reason for the speed decrease.
4. Choose the answer that states the forces influencing the car are not balanced.
