Instructions:
1. Understand the concept of animal instinct: innate behaviors present from birth.
2. Evaluate each option:
   - Migrating: often driven by instinctual responses to environmental cues.
   - Hibernating: an instinctual response to survive harsh conditions.
   - Hunting skills: can be instinctual but also learned and refined through experience.
   - Building nests: an instinctual behavior for many species.
3. Identify the option that involves learned behaviors and is not solely instinctual.
4. Hunting skills can be learned, so it is not solely an example of instinct.
