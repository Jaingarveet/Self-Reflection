Instructions:
1. Understand the initial scenario: a toy car rolling down an inclined track at a constant speed.
2. Recognize the change: the car reaches a flat surface, and its speed decreases.
3. Identify the relevant forces: gravity, normal force, and friction.
4. Analyze the forces: On the incline, gravity has two components. On the flat surface, only the perpendicular component of gravity remains, balanced by the normal force.
5. Understand force balance: The forces on the car are now balanced, removing the acceleration, and thus, the car's speed decreases.
6. Choose the answer: The correct answer is [REDACTED]; the forces influencing the car are now balanced, explaining the decrease in speed.
