Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the criteria for the correct answer ("reused many times").
2. Evaluate each option based on the recycling properties of the materials:
   - Steel cans are recyclable but often undergo a different process and are not commonly reused multiple times.
   - Glass bottles can be recycled and reused indefinitely without significant quality degradation.
   - Paper containers degrade with each recycling cycle and are not suitable for reuse many times.
   - Plastic containers undergo similar issues as paper; they degrade and are not suitable for indefinite reuse.
3. Select the answer that best meets the criteria: Glass bottles (Choice B).
