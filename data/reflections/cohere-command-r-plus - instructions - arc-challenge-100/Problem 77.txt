Instructions:
1. Understand the current conditions on Hirta: an abundance of grass and no natural sheep predators. 
2. Recognize the key fact: the increase in light-wool sheep over the last 20 years, indicating their dominance in the population. 
3. Interpret the impact of the new predator: it will make sheep easier prey, leading to a decrease in their overall population. 
4. Identify the initial change: a decline in the number of light-wool sheep, as they are now the majority and more available to the predator. 
5. Choose the answer reflecting this initial decrease in light-wool sheep.
