Instructions:
1. Understand the relationship between density and mass: Density = Mass / Volume, so Mass = Density x Volume. 
2. Recognize that the question asks for the lowest mass, which will be determined by the material with the lowest density, regardless of volume. 
3. Identify the densities: bricks have a density of 2000 kg/m^3, and air has a density of 1 kg/m^3. 
4. Choose the option with the lowest volume of bricks, as this will result in the lowest mass.
