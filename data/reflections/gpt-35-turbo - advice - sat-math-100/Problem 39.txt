Advice:
 - Always double-check your simplification and algebraic manipulation.
 - Always check if the two equations represent the same line or two different lines.
 - Always check if the system has one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solution.
 - Always check if the two equations represent parallel lines to determine if the system has no solution.
 - Remember that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations must be proportional for the two lines to be parallel.
