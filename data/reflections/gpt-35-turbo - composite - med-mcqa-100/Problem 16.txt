Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED], which is incorrect. The correct answer is [REDACTED]. The subscapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery anastomose to form the scapular anastomosis, which provides collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction of the axillary artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries are not part of this anastomosis and do not provide collateral circulation in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of anatomy
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
In obstruction of the second part of the axillary artery, the anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery will maintain the blood supply of the upper limb. The scapular anastomosis is formed by the subscapular artery and the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery, which anastomose around the scapula to provide collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the parts of the axillary artery and their branches.
3. Identify the anastomoses between the arteries that provide collateral circulation to the upper limb.
4. Choose the option that correctly identifies the anastomoses that provide collateral circulation in case of obstruction of the axillary artery.
5. Double-check your reasoning and answer.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always review your anatomy knowledge before answering anatomy questions.
 - Always think through each option step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
