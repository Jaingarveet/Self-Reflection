Explanation:
I underestimated the average gain in length in 4 years. 
The gap in my knowledge was in the average growth rate of children. 
I knew that children grow about 5 cm per year, but I did not multiply it by 4 years.
Error Keywords:
 - Underestimation error
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
On average, a child grows about 5 cm per year.
To calculate the average gain in length in 4 years, we need to multiply the average growth rate by the number of years.
Therefore, the average gain in length in 4 years would be around 20 cm (5 cm/year * 4 years).
Instructions:
1. Identify the average growth rate of children.
2. Identify the number of years.
3. Multiply the average growth rate by the number of years.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula to solve the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that multiplication is the result of adding a number to itself a certain number of times.
