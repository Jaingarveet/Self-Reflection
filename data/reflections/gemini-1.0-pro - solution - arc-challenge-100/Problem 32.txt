Solution:
[REDACTED] wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another.
There are two main types of waves: mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves.
Mechanical waves require a medium to travel through, while electromagnetic waves do not.
Tossing a ball in the air generates a mechanical wave called a transverse wave.
Shaking the ends of a rope generates a mechanical wave called a transverse wave.
Throwing a pebble into a pool of water generates a mechanical wave called a surface wave.
Pulling on a coiled spring toy generates a mechanical wave called a longitudinal wave.
