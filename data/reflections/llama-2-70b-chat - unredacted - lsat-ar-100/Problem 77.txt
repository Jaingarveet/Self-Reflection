  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider the impact of the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This rule limits the assignment of a parking space for Young to only two possible spaces, #5 and #6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) four.

Error Keywords:

* Oversight
* Misinterpretation of rules
* Insufficient consideration of constraints

2. Consider the impact of each rule on the assignment of parking spaces for each employee.
3. Determine which employees have limited options for parking space assignment due to the rules.
4. Count the number of employees with limited options.
5. Answer the question based on the count.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the rules governing the assignment of parking spaces.
2. Create a list of the rules and their impact on each employee's parking space assignment.
3. Evaluate each employee's options based on the rules and identify those with limited options.
4. Count the number of employees with limited options.
