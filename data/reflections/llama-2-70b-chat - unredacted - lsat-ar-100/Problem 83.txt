  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. I thought it meant that they had to lead sessions on different days, but it actually means that they cannot lead sessions that meet at the same time (i.e., both morning or both afternoon sessions).

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the constraint
* Incorrect inference

Solution:

1. Julio leads a morning session on Wednesday.
2. Kevin leads a morning session on Thursday.
3. Lan leads an afternoon session on Wednesday.
4. Nessa leads an afternoon session on Friday.
5. Olivia leads a morning session on Friday.

Instructions:

1. Identify the sessions that Julio and Kevin must lead.
2. Infer the day and time of Julio's session based on the constraint that Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
3. Infer the day and time of Kevin's session based on the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
4. Identify the sessions that Lan and Olivia must lead based on the constraint that they cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
5. Infer the day and time of Lan's session based on the constraint that Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
6. Infer the day and time of Olivia's session based on the constraint that she cannot lead a session that meets at the same time as Lan's session.
7. Check the answer choices and select the one that is not true based on the inferred schedule.

Advice:

* Always carefully read and understand the constraints given in the problem.
* Use a systematic approach to infer the schedule based on the constraints.
* Double-check your inferences and calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Consider all possible scenarios and test them against the given constraints.
* Be mindful of the language used in the question and the answer choices, and avoid misinterpreting the information.
