  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my reasoning. I assumed that Nina must give the morning report on Wednesday, but that is not necessarily true. Nina can give the afternoon report on Wednesday, and Lenore can give the morning report on Wednesday.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the conditions
* Incorrect deductions
* Failure to consider all possible scenarios

Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. Monday morning report: George must give the morning report on Monday, as Tuesday is the only day he can give a report.
2. Tuesday morning report: Olivia must give the morning report on Tuesday, as she cannot give an afternoon report.
3. Wednesday morning report: Lenore can give the morning report on Wednesday, as Nina can give the afternoon report on Wednesday.

Therefore, the list of students giving morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is:

Monday: George
Tuesday: Olivia
Wednesday: Lenore

Action: Answer("D")
