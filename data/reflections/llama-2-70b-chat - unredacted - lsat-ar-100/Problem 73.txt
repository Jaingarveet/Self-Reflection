  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that if exactly three students review Undulation, then we can list them as U1, U2, and U3, and use the given information to deduce their identities. However, I failed to consider the possibility that the three students who review Undulation may not be distinct.

Error Keywords:

* Misconception
* Flawed reasoning
* Insufficient consideration of possibilities

Solution:
Let's re-examine the given information:

* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If exactly three students review Undulation, then we can list them as U1, U2, and U3. We can also deduce that U1 and U2 cannot be Megregian, as Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, U1 and U2 must be Kramer and O'Neill.

However, we still need to identify U3. We know that U3 cannot be Lopez, as Lopez does not review Undulation. Therefore, U3 must be Jiang, as Jiang reviews a different play than Kramer and O'Neill.

Thus, the correct answer is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.

Instructions:

1. Carefully read the given information and identify the key constraints.
2. Use a systematic approach to eliminate impossible combinations of students who review Undulation.
3. Consider all possible combinations of students who review Undulation and verify whether they satisfy the given constraints.
4. Choose the answer that corresponds to the identified combination of students.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the question and given information to identify the key constraints.
* Use a systematic approach to eliminate impossible combinations of students who review Undulation.
* Consider all possible combinations of students who review Undulation and verify whether they satisfy the given constraints.
* Be aware of the possibility that the three students who review Undulation may not be distinct.
* Double-check your reasoning and final answer to ensure accuracy.
