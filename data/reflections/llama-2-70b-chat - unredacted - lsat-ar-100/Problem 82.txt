  Action: Answer("B")

Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. After re-evaluating the question and the choices, I realized that the correct answer is indeed B.

Here's why:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Choice B satisfies all the conditions:

* Zone 1: Kim, Tiao (satisfies condition 1)
* Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall (satisfies condition 2)
* Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn (satisfies condition 3)

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this answer is helpful.
