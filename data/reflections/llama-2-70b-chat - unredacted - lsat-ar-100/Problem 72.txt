  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and misunderstood the constraints of the problem. I thought that the pharmacy had to be next to the optometrist, but it can actually be next to the veterinarian. The correct answer is D, a restaurant and the toy store, as the pharmacy can be next to the veterinarian, and the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
