  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that if both G and H are selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist. However, I incorrectly concluded that the panel must include either M or Q. In reality, if both G and H are selected, then the panel must include either F or K, as they are the only remaining scientists of the three types.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the conditions
* Incorrect application of logic

Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions again:

* The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
* If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
* F and K cannot both be selected.
* K and M cannot both be selected.
* If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If both G and H are selected, then we have two botanists. According to the second condition, we can select at most one zoologist. Therefore, we must select either F or K.

Instructions:

1. Read the conditions carefully.
2. Identify the scientists that must be selected.
3. Apply the conditions to determine which scientists cannot be selected.
4. Determine which scientists must be selected based on the conditions.
5. Choose the correct answer.

Advice:

* Always read the conditions carefully and understand them fully.
* Use a systematic approach to apply the conditions and determine the correct answer.
* Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
* Consider all possible scenarios and test your answer against each one.
* Remember that the conditions may impose constraints on the selection of scientists, and not all combinations may be possible.
