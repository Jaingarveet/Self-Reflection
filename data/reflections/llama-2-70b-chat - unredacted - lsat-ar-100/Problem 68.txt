  Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conditions and created an incorrect order for the articles. 
I did not consider all possible combinations of the conditions and mistakenly assumed that S must be second. 
I also overlooked the fact that Q could be first.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Incorrect order
 - Failure to consider all possible combinations
Solution:
The seven articles must be edited in the following order to meet all the conditions:
S, Q, Y, J, G, R, H

Instructions:
1. List all possible orders of the articles that satisfy the conditions.
2. Check each order to ensure that consecutive articles cover different topics.
3. Verify that S is earlier than Q and Y, and that J is earlier than G and R.
4. Choose the correct answer based on the order that satisfies all the conditions.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all possible combinations of the conditions.
 - Always create a list of possible solutions before selecting the correct answer.
 - Always double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the order of the articles is not always intuitive and must be carefully analyzed.
