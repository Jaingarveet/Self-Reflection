  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions.
I assumed that Jiang could only review Sunset or Undulation, which is not necessarily true.
I also assumed that Megregian could not review Tamerlane, which is also not true.
Error Keywords:
- False dichotomy
- Incorrect assumptions
- Overlooked possibilities
Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step again:

1. Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
2. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
3. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
4. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then:

1. Jiang can review Sunset, Undulation, or both.
2. Lopez must review Undulation, as Kramer and O'Neill already review Tamerlane.
3. Megregian can review Sunset or Tamerlane.
4. If Megregian reviews Sunset, then O'Neill must review Undulation.
5. If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then O'Neill must review Sunset.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Megregian reviews Tamerlane.
