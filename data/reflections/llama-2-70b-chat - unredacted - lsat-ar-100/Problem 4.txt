  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions. I assumed that if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Olivia cannot lead a Wednesday session. However, that is not necessarily true. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, but that does not mean they cannot both lead sessions on Wednesday.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the problem
* Incorrect assumptions
* Failure to consider all possible scenarios

Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again, considering all possible scenarios:

1. If Lan leads a Wednesday session, then Olivia cannot lead a Wednesday session. In this case, Rebecca must lead a Thursday session, and Kevin must lead a Friday session.
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Olivia can lead a Wednesday session. In this case, Rebecca must lead a Thursday session, and Kevin must lead a Friday session.
3. If Lan leads a Thursday session, then Olivia cannot lead a Thursday session. In this case, Rebecca must lead a Wednesday session, and Kevin must lead a Friday session.
4. If Lan does not lead a Thursday session, then Olivia can lead a Thursday session. In this case, Rebecca must lead a Wednesday session, and Kevin must lead a Friday session.

From the above scenarios, we can see that in all cases, Rebecca must lead a Thursday session. Therefore, the answer is A: Rebecca.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Consider all possible scenarios and create a plan to solve the problem.
3. Use a systematic approach to eliminate incorrect answers.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
* Consider all possible scenarios and create a plan to solve the problem.
* Use a systematic approach to eliminate incorrect answers.
* Double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Don't make assumptions without considering all possible scenarios.
