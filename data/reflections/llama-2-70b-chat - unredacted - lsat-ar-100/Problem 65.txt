  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and overlooked a critical detail in the question.
I correctly deduced that F must be selected if M is the only chemist selected, but I failed to consider the possibility that both G and H could be selected as botanists.
I also missed the fact that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which means that all three zoologists must be selected.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooked detail
- Incomplete reasoning
- Misunderstanding of conditions
Solution:
Re-reading the question, I realize that I should have paid closer attention to the conditions governing the selection of the panelists.
If M is the only chemist selected, the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist.
F must be selected since K and M cannot both be selected.
G and H can both be selected as botanists, and since M is selected, both P and R must be selected as zoologists.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: P, Q, and R are all selected.
Instructions:
1. Re-read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions governing the selection of the panelists.
2. Work through each possible scenario in your head or on paper, considering all the conditions and ensuring that your answer satisfies all of them.
3. Double-check your answer to ensure that it logically follows from the given conditions.
Advice:
- Always take your time when answering questions and avoid rushing to conclusions.
- Make sure you understand all the conditions and requirements of the problem before starting to work on it.
- Consider all possible scenarios and test your answer against each one to ensure that it is correct.
- Double-check your work to catch any errors or oversights.
