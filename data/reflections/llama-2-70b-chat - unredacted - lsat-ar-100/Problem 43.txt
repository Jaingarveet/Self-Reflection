  Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition that states "S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third."
I thought it meant that S had to be earlier than Q, which led me to choose D.
However, the correct interpretation is that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third, which means Q can be second or third.
Therefore, the correct answer is A, as J is second.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation
* Misunderstanding
* Conditional statements

Solution:
The seven articles can be placed in the following order to satisfy all the conditions:
S, Q, Y, J, G, R, H

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Identify the articles and their topics.
3. Create a list of possible orders that satisfy the conditions.
4. Check each possible order to see if it meets all the conditions.
5. Choose the correct answer based on the order that satisfies all the conditions.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Pay close attention to the wording of the conditions and interpret them correctly.
* Use a systematic approach to solve the problem, such as creating a list of possible orders and checking each one against the conditions.
* Double-check your answer to ensure it satisfies all the conditions.
