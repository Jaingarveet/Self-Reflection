  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning by assuming that Himalayans must be featured on days 3, 5, and 7.
Instead, Himalayans can be featured on any three consecutive days, as long as they are not featured on day 1 or day 7.
Error Keywords:
- Consecutive days
- Featured days
- Breed restrictions
Solution:
Let's analyze the given information:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they can be featured on any three consecutive days, as long as they are not featured on day 1 or day 7.
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Siamese are featured on day 4.
