  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I thought that if exactly one chemist was selected, it must be K, but that is not necessarily true.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of conditions
* Incorrect application of logic

Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again, taking into account the correct conditions:

1. If F is selected as the botanist, then K cannot be selected as the chemist since K and M cannot both be selected. In this case, L must be selected as the chemist. This combination satisfies all conditions.
2. If G is selected as the botanist, then K can be selected as the chemist. This combination also satisfies all conditions.
3. If H is selected as the botanist, then L must be selected as the chemist. In this case, M must be selected as the third scientist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. This combination satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.

Instructions:

1. Read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Decompose the problem into possible combinations.
3. Analyze each combination and eliminate those that violate the conditions.
4. Select the remaining combination that satisfies all conditions.
5. Answer the question based on the selected combination.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and understand the conditions.
* Decompose the problem into possible combinations.
* Analyze each combination and eliminate those that violate the conditions.
* Select the remaining combination that satisfies all conditions.
* Answer the question based on the selected combination.
* Double-check your work to ensure that your answer satisfies all conditions.
