  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning by assuming that Truvest's website target being shorter than its voicemail target means that Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days. However, it's possible that Truvest's website target is 2 days and its voicemail target is 3 days.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the information
* Incorrect assumption
* Lack of consideration of all possible scenarios

Solution:
Let's analyze the information given:

* Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
* None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
* Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
* Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

From the information above, we can deduce the following:

* Truvest's website target is 2 days (since it's shorter than its voicemail target).
* Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days (since it's longer than its website target).
* Image's voicemail target is 1 day (since it's the shortest voicemail target).
* Image's website target is 2 days (since it's longer than its voicemail target).
* Solide's website target is 1 day (since it's shorter than Truvest's website target).

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
