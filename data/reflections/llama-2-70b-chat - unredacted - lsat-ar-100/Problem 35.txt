  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly inferred that the first batch of sugar cookies was made on Wednesday, when in fact, it could have been made on Thursday.

Error Keywords:

* Inference error
* Logical reasoning error
* Misinterpretation of information

Solution:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step again:

* The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so it's made on Tuesday.
* The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
* The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
* The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.

Now, let's consider the conditions:

* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

From the given information, we can infer that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, not Wednesday.

Now, let's evaluate the choices again:

A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
This is true, as we have established that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
This is false, as we have established that only one batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.

C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
This is true, as the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.

D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
This is false, as we have established that only one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.

E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
This is true, as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.

Therefore, the answer is E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
