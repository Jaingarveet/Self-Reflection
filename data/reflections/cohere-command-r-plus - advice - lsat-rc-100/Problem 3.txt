Advice:
1. Understand the Context: Ensure you grasp the underlying argument and the concepts being discussed, in this case, the relationship between firm size, specialization, and market power. 
2. Identify Key Connections: Note the connections the author draws between concepts and identify which of these connections are being challenged by the question. 
3. Evaluate Choices Carefully: Each choice should be evaluated in the context of the specific connection being discussed, rather than general statements about the topic. 
4. Avoid Red Herrings: Be cautious of choices that may be true but do not directly address the specific connection in question.
