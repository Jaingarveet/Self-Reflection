Solution:
We can use the formula: 
Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither
We know that:
Group 1 (hardcover) = [REDACTED]
Group 2 (fiction) = [REDACTED]
Total = 45
We need to find Both (hardcover and fiction)
Neither = Total - (Group 1 + Group 2) = 45 - ([REDACTED] + [REDACTED]) = 45 - 50 = 0
We can now solve for Both:
Both = Group 1 + Group 2 - Total + Neither = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] - 45 + 0 = 5
