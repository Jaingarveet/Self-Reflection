Solution:
Let's call the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] "d".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], and then at a constant speed of [REDACTED] mph from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED].
We also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching [REDACTED], only 70 miles away from it.
Let's start by using the formula: distance = rate x time
Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] "t1", and the time it took him to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] "t2".
We know that:
distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = d
distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = d
rate from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = 70 mph
rate from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] mph
time from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = t1
time from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] = t2
We also know that:
distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] - 70 = distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] + 70
Let's use these equations to solve for d:
d = 70t1
d = [REDACTED]t2
d - 70 = [REDACTED](t2 - 3)
We can use the first two equations to solve for t1 and t2 in terms of d:
t1 = d/70
t2 = d/[REDACTED]
We can substitute these expressions for t1 and t2 into the third equation:
d - 70 = [REDACTED](d/[REDACTED] - 3)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
d - 70 = d - [REDACTED]
Adding 70 to both sides, we get:
d = 340
Therefore, the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] is 340 miles.
