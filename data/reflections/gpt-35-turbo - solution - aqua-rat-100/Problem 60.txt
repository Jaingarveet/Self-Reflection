Solution:
If [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], then the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is half the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
The measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED], so the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED].
The measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] is 150°.
The sum of the measures of minor arc A[REDACTED] and minor arc B[REDACTED] is equal to the circumference of the circle.
Let x be the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED].
Then, x + [REDACTED] + 150° = 360° (the circumference of the circle)
Solving for x, we get x = [REDACTED].
