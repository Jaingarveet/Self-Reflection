Solution:
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
We need to find [REDACTED] baguettes = ? pita breads
Let's start by finding the number of falafels in 1 roll.
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
So, 1 roll = 6/[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] pita breads
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
So, 1 roll = 5/[REDACTED] baguettes
Therefore, 1 baguette = [REDACTED]/5 rolls = [REDACTED]/5 * [REDACTED] pita breads = 9/5 pita breads
[REDACTED] baguettes = [REDACTED] * 9/5 pita breads = 18/5 pita breads
So, [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.
We need to simplify this fraction.
18/5 = [REDACTED].6
18/5 = [REDACTED] [REDACTED]/5
