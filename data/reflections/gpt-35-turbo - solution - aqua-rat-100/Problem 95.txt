Solution:
John replaces 15% of 50% strong milk tea twice, which means he replaces 7.5% of tea with milk twice.
After the first replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 42.5%.
After the second replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 36.125%.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
The concentration of tea becomes 32.5125%.
