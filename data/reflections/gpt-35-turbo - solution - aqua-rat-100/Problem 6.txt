Solution:
Let's first calculate the fraction of work done by each painter in a day.
Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house in a day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in [REDACTED] days, so he can paint 1/[REDACTED] of a house in a day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in [REDACTED] days, so he can paint 1/[REDACTED] of a house in a day.
After [REDACTED] days, Mr.Brown has completed [REDACTED]*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.
Now, Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/[REDACTED]) = 3/4 of the work.
Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black have completed (4/3 + 3/4) = 25/[REDACTED] of the work.
Thus, the remaining work is (1 - 25/[REDACTED]) = [REDACTED]/[REDACTED] of the work.
Let's assume Mr.Blue takes x days to complete the remaining work.
So, in x days, Mr.Blue can complete (1/[REDACTED])*x of the work.
Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
(1/[REDACTED])*x = [REDACTED]/[REDACTED]
x = ([REDACTED]/[REDACTED])/(1/[REDACTED])
x = [REDACTED]
Therefore, it will take Mr.Blue [REDACTED] days to complete the contract.
