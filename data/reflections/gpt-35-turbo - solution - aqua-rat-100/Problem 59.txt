Solution:
Initially, the bag had only white marbles.
20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, so there are now 20 black marbles in the bag.
The total number of marbles in the bag is Q.
The percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 * 100 = 5%.
Let's assume the total number of marbles in the bag is Q.
So, 5% of Q is equal to 1 black marble.
Therefore, 5% of Q = 1.
Hence, Q = 20 / 0.05 = [REDACTED]0.
The total number of marbles in the bag is [REDACTED]0.
