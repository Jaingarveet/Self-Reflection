Solution:
Let's assume that Sachin played 'x' matches in the season before the finals.
Then, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season before the finals = 51x
After the finals, the total runs scored by Sachin in the season = 51x + 7[REDACTED]
Also, we know that the batting average after the finals is 54.
So, (51x + 7[REDACTED])/(x+1) = 54
Solving this equation, we get x = [REDACTED]
Therefore, Sachin played [REDACTED] matches in the season before the finals.
So, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season = [REDACTED] + 1 (finals) = [REDACTED]
