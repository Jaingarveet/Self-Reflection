Solution:
The outer surface of the cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150 square cm.
The number of smaller cubes that make up the outer surface is 5x5x6 - 3x3x6 = 150.
Each face of a smaller cube has an area of 1 square cm, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 150 x 6 = 900.
The number of faces that remain unpainted is 900 - 150 = 750.
