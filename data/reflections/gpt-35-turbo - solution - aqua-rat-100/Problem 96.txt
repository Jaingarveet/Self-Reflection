Solution:
Let's assume [REDACTED] joined the business after x months.
[REDACTED] invested for the entire year, so his share of the profit is (12/12) = 1.
[REDACTED] invested for 10 months (12-2), so his share of the profit is (10/12) = 5/6.
[REDACTED] invested for (12-x) months, so his share of the profit is ((12-x)/12).
The sum of their shares of the profit is 1 + 5/6 + ((12-x)/12) = 375000/150000 = 2.5.
Simplifying the equation, we get (24 + 20 + 12 - 2x)/24 = 5/2.
Solving for x, we get x = 4.
Therefore, [REDACTED] joined the business after [REDACTED].
