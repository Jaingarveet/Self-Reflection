Solution:
Let the initial contribution of each man be x.
So, the total contribution of M men would be Mx = [REDACTED].
Therefore, x = D/M.
After 3 men drop out, the total number of men becomes M-3.
So, the new contribution of each man would be ([REDACTED]).
The difference between the two contributions would be ([REDACTED]) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
