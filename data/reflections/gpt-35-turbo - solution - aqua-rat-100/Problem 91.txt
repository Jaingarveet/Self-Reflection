Solution:
We can use Pythagoras theorem to find the distance between the starting point and the final point.
The distance travelled towards south and north will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards east and west will cancel each other out.
The distance travelled towards south is 3 km.
The distance travelled towards north is 3 km.
The distance travelled towards east is 5 km.
The distance travelled towards west is 2 km.
The net distance travelled towards south is 3 km - 3 km = 0 km.
The net distance travelled towards east is 5 km - 2 km = 3 km.
The distance between the starting point and the final point is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of 3 km and 3 km.
Using Pythagoras theorem, we get:
distance^2 = 3^2 + 3^2
distance^2 = 18
distance = sqrt(18) = 3sqrt(2)
