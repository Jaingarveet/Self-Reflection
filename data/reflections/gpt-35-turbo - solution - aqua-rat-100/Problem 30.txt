Solution:
Roy has to take 5 tablets with a gap of 15 minutes between each tablet.
To find the total time, we need to multiply the time gap between each tablet by the number of tablets.
The time gap between each tablet is 15 minutes.
The number of tablets is 5.
The total time taken to consume all the tablets is 15 minutes x 4 = 60 minutes.
