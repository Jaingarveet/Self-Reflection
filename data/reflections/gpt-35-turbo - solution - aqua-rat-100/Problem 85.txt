Solution:
Let's assume that the speed of the elevator is "x steps/minute".
From the first statement, we can say that the total number of steps in the staircase is 20 steps. So, the time taken to reach the bottom is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (20 steps)/(10 minutes) = 2 steps/minute.
From the second statement, we can say that the elevator's speed is half of the speed in the first statement. Therefore, the speed of the elevator can be calculated as (2 steps/minute) / 2 = [REDACTED].
