Solution:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x".
The cost of eatables per person would be 96/x.
When 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to pay an additional Rs. 4 each.
So, the new cost of eatables per person would be (96/(x-4)) + 4.
We can create an equation based on the above information and solve for "x".
Equation: 96/x = (96/(x-4)) + 4
Solving for "x":
96/x - 96/(x-4) = 4
(96(x-4) - 96x)/(x(x-4)) = 4
-3[REDACTED]4/(x^2 - 4x) = 4
x^2 - 4x = -96
x^2 - 4x + 96 = 0
(x-[REDACTED])(x-[REDACTED]) = 0
x = [REDACTED] or x = [REDACTED]
Since 4 friends did not turn up, the number of friends who attended the picnic must be less than or equal to [REDACTED].
Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
