Solution:
We can use the formula: distance = speed x time
We need to find the speed of the space shuttle first.
The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the distance it covers during this time is 5 x 17.5 = 87.5 m.
To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to subtract the distance it traveled during the 40 seconds from the total distance it traveled during the 40 seconds.
Total distance = 700 m
Distance traveled during 40 seconds = 40 x 17.5 = 700 m
Length of space shuttle = Total distance - Distance traveled during 40 seconds = 700 - 700 = 0 m
The length of the space shuttle is 0 m, which means that the space shuttle is a point in space.
