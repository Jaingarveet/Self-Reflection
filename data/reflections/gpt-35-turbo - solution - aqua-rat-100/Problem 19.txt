Solution:
Let's use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
Let's assume the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is S km/hr.
On the return journey, the speed of the jeep is (S+12) km/hr.
Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is [REDACTED] km.
Using the formula, we can create two equations:
Forward journey: [REDACTED] = S x 6
Return journey: [REDACTED] = (S+12) x 4
We can solve for [REDACTED] by equating the two equations:
S x 6 = (S+12) x 4
6S = 4S + 48
2S = 48
S = 24
Substituting S=24 into the forward journey equation:
[REDACTED] = S x 6 = 24 x 6 = 144 km
