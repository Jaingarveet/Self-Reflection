Solution:
Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in the store.
[REDACTED] of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, which means 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored.
The remaining chocolates are vanilla flavored.
90% of the remaining chocolates (90 chocolates) are squashed, which means [REDACTED] of the remaining chocolates (10 chocolates) are not squashed.
We need to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.
10 chocolates are not squashed and vanilla flavored.
The percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10/100 = [REDACTED].
