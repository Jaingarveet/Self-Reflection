Solution:
The rope tied to the cow is the radius of the circular area it can graze.
The area of the circle is pi*r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.
We need to find the area of the field and divide it by the area the cow can graze in a day.
The radius of the circle is 14/2 = 7 feet.
The area of the field is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*7^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places)
The time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is T = A/10 = 15.39 days (rounded to two decimal places)
