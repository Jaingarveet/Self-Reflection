Solution:
The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 centimeters multiplied by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds.
The circumference of a circle with a radius of 10 centimeters is 20π centimeters.
The fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, which is equal to 5 revolutions per second.
Therefore, the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds is 5 x 30 = 150 revolutions.
The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is 2 x 20π x 10 x 150 = 6000π centimeters.
