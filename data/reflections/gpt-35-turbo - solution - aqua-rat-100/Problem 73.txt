Solution:
Let's assume that the number of students in the school is x.
According to the question, 20% of x took physics and 28% of x took math.
We can write the following equations:
0.2x > 0 (since there must be at least one student who took physics)
0.28x > 0 (since there must be at least one student who took math)
To find the minimum value of x, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies both equations.
We can start by assuming that x is a multiple of 100, since 20% and 28% are multiples of 100.
If x = 500, then 20% of x is 100 and 28% of x is 140, which means that there are at least 240 students in the school.
If x = [REDACTED], then 20% of x is 120 and 28% of x is 168, which means that there are at least 288 students in the school.
If x = [REDACTED], then 20% of x is 140 and 28% of x is 196, which means that there are at least 336 students in the school.
Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is [REDACTED], and the correct answer is "[REDACTED]".
