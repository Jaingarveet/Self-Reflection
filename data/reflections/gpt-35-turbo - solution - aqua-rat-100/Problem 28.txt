Solution:
The probability that neither of the two events will occur is equal to 1 minus the probability that at least one of the events will occur.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is when the probability of both events occurring is the highest.
The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.56 x 0.74 = 0.4144.
The probability that at least one of the events will occur is 1 - 0.4144 = 0.5856.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.5856 = 0.4144.
