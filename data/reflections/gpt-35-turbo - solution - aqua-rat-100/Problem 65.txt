Solution:
Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
According to the problem statement, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
Simplifying this equation, we get 299997a + 29997b + 2997c + 297d + 30e = 10a + b + c + d + e + 3.
Simplifying further, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c + 296d = 7e + 3.
Since the left-hand side is divisible by 7, the right-hand side must also be divisible by 7.
The only value of e that satisfies this condition is 6.
Substituting e = 6 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c + 296d = 45.
The only possible value of d that satisfies this equation is 5.
Substituting d = 5 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b + 2996c = 25.
The only possible value of c that satisfies this equation is 2.
Substituting c = 2 in the equation, we get 299986a + 29996b = 7.
The only possible value of b that satisfies this equation is 1.
Substituting b = 1 in the equation, we get 299986a = 4.
The only possible value of a that satisfies this equation is 1.
Therefore, the 5 digit number is 14285.
