Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the passage. I focused on the fact that no crops were planted in the pilot experiments, but I failed to consider the effect that planting crops would have had on the weeds.
The gap in my knowledge was not in English but in my understanding of the passage.
I knew the correct information but misinterpreted its meaning.
