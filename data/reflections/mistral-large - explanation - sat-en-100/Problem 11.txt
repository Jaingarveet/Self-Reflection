Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the table. I assumed that since each pathogen had 100% infection rate in colonies with colony collapse disorder, all four pathogens together would also have a 100% infection rate. However, the table does not provide information on the percentage of colonies infected by all four pathogens together.

I answered the question incorrectly because I made a calculation error. I multiplied the number of letters in the city and state names incorrectly.
