Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand each professor's statement.
2. Consider the implications of each statement being true.
3. Identify the constraints given in the problem (one fully correct, one half correct, one fully incorrect).
4. Systematically consider each possibility of a professor being fully correct.
5. For each possibility, check if the other professors' accuracy is consistent with the constraints.
6. Eliminate possibilities that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
7. The remaining possibility that satisfies all constraints is the correct answer.
