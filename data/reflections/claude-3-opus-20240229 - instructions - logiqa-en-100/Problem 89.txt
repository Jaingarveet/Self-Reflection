Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and note all constraints and conditions.
2. Identify the key entities (patients and doctors) and their characteristics.
3. Analyze each constraint one by one and determine its implications.
4. Look for necessary conclusions that must follow from the constraints.
5. Eliminate any scenarios that are impossible based on the constraints.
6. If a statement must be true in all possible scenarios, then it is a necessary conclusion.
