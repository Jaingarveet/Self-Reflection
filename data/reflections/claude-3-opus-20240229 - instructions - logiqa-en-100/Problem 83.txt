Instructions:
1. Carefully note all the given constraints.
2. Consider the implications of the known non-participant(s).
3. Systematically reason through the different possible cases.
4. Within each case, apply the constraints to determine the implications.
5. Look for scenarios where the implications lead to a contradiction or definite answer.
6. If a definite answer emerges, double-check the reasoning.
7. If no definite answer emerges, more information may be needed.
