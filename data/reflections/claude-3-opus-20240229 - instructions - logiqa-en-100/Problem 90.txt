Instructions:
1. Carefully read the context and identify the key constraints and requirements.
2. Look for fundamental conflicts or contradictions between the requirements.
3. Consider if it's possible to satisfy all requirements simultaneously given the constraints.
4. If there is an unresolvable conflict, the conclusion should state the inability to achieve all goals.
5. Eliminate answer choices that don't fully capture the fundamental dilemma.
6. Choose the conclusion that most accurately reflects the implications of the conflicting demands.
