Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all given information and constraints.
2. Identify the key entities (assistants and departments in this case).
3. Consider the implications of each piece of given information and constraint.
4. Try to assign entities to roles in a way that satisfies all constraints.
5. If a contradiction arises, backtrack and try a different assignment.
6. Once a consistent assignment is found, check if it necessarily implies any of the answer choices.
7. Select the answer choice that must be true based on the given information and constraints.
