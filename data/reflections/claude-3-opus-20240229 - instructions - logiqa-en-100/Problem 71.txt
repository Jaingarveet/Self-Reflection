Instructions:
1. Identify the apparent contradiction in the survey results.
2. Consider each answer choice carefully. Don't just look for a direct explanation, but think about the broader implications of each statement.
3. Look for an answer that reveals people's underlying motivations or beliefs that could explain the contradiction.
4. Reason through how that motivation would lead to favoring an idea in principle but not following it in personal practice.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to explaining the contradiction.
6. Select the answer choice that best resolves the apparent contradiction by providing insight into people's reasoning.
