Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and list out all the given conditions.
2. Consider each condition one by one and think about its implications.
3. Look for connections between the conditions. See if the implication of one condition can be combined with another condition to draw a new conclusion.
4. Consider the contrapositive of each condition as well as the condition itself.
5. Systematically eliminate the choices that contradict the conditions or their implications.
6. If a choice matches the implications of the conditions, it must be true.
7. Double-check your reasoning to ensure you haven't missed anything.
