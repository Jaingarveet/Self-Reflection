Instructions:
1. Read the premises carefully, noting any qualifying language like "usually", "sometimes", "often", etc.
2. Read the conclusion and determine if it follows from the premises.
3. Consider if the conclusion would still hold if the premises were not absolutes. Look for exception cases.
4. If there are any scenarios, even if unlikely, where the conclusion could be false despite the premises being true, then the conclusion is not an absolute.
5. Select the answer choice that best reflects the likelihood of the conclusion being true or false, allowing for exceptions.
