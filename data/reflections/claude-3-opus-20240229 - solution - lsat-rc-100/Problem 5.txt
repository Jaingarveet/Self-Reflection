Solution:
1. The passage introduces two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism:
   a) Art should stand above everyday reality (not elaborated in detail)
   b) Art should be grounded in concrete reality and be useful to society (radical view)
2. Dostoyevsky's third position is then introduced and elaborated in detail:
   - Reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality was deeper
   - No distinction between fantasy and reality; reality shaped by the experiencer
   - Writer's task is to explode boundaries of the so-called real world
   - Art should be judged on "artistic merit", not political utility
   - Artistic merit means expressing thoughts well in characters and images
   - Usefulness of art can't always be precisely measured
3. Dostoyevsky's position is differentiated in detail primarily from the second, radical position. The first position is not significantly elaborated on.
Therefore, the passage presents three positions, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the second radical position in detail.
