Solution:
The sentence in lines 7-11 reports the view of some legal scholars that lawyers should represent defendants in court regardless of their own judgments about the defendant's guilt or innocence. 
In contrast, the sentence in lines 28-31 expresses the author's own opinion that lawyers should try to prove a client's innocence only in cases where the lawyer sincerely believes the client may be innocent. This implies that if the lawyer believes the client is guilty, they should not attempt to prove innocence.
Thus, the author's opinion in lines 28-31 opposes the view reported in lines 7-11. The author believes a lawyer's actions should depend on their belief in the client's innocence, while the earlier reported view states lawyers should always represent defendants without judging guilt or innocence themselves.
