Solution:
The passage states that under the digital publishing model, authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds since many traditional publishing expenses are eliminated. 
Literary agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional.
The passage then states that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors to digital-only publishers.
This pressure from literary agents is described as the driving force that will push traditional publishers to adapt to the digital model.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree that the demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model (choice C).
