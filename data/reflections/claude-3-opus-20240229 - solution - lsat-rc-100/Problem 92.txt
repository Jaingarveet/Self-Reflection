Solution:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education argues that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism. It claims that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the internal perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Answer choice [REDACTED] directly challenges this criticism by arguing that it is impossible to truly adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. If this is true, then the criticism's proposed solution - studying cultures using their own internal methods - is not feasible. This undermines the criticism by suggesting its key claim is impossible to implement.
