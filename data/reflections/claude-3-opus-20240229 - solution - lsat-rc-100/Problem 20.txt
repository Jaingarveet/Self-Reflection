Solution:
1. The author introduces the concept of a twofold obligation for defense lawyers: to the defendant and to the court/society (lines 20-23).
2. The author argues that because of this twofold obligation, lawyers should not present false assertions to the court or demonstrate the innocence of clients they know to be guilty (lines 23-32).
3. The author believes that the "best defense" can only be provided by a lawyer who is convinced of the merits of the case after careful analysis (lines 37-40).
4. The author states that the fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean lawyers should take every case they are offered (lines 40-43).
5. The author does not suggest that the twofold obligation creates a conflict of interest for defense lawyers or prevents them from effectively representing their clients.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: the author is convinced that the twofold obligation does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers.
