Solution:
Passage [REDACTED] argues that fingerprint evidence should be admissible despite some open questions about its scientific basis. It acknowledges there are no uniform, objective standards that specify the number of matching points required to declare a fingerprint match. However, it contends that fingerprint examiners still follow a consistent approach and that the long history of fingerprint evidence use in trials demonstrates its underlying reliability.
Passage [REDACTED] argues that fingerprint evidence is unreliable because fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for declaring a match between two prints. It states there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification, with practices varying between jurisdictions. The passage emphasizes that without data on how likely partial prints from different people are to match, the value of fingerprint evidence cannot be properly evaluated. It suggests error rates are understudied and some proficiency tests are not rigorous.
While the two passages come to different conclusions, they both agree on the key principle that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. Passage [REDACTED] believes the lack of fully uniform standards is not disqualifying given fingerprinting's long history, while Passage [REDACTED] sees it as a critical flaw. But both share the underlying premise that objective standards are important for assessing the reliability of fingerprint examination.
