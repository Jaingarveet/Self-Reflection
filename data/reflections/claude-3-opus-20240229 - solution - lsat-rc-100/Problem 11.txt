Solution:
The author asserts in lines 11-16 that while many African American authors have incorporated music/musicians thematically into their works, Toni Morrison was the first to use a musical genre (jazz) as the organizing structural principle for an entire novel in her 1992 book Jazz.
Choice [REDACTED] suggests that, to some extent, any novel can be considered musical in nature, especially if read aloud. This calls into question whether Morrison's use of jazz structure was truly a unique innovation. If all novels are inherently musical, then perhaps Morrison was simply the first to explicitly highlight that musicality, rather than pioneering a completely new approach. While Choice [REDACTED] doesn't definitively contradict the author's assertion, it invites doubt by implying that the musical qualities Morrison employed may be more universal to the novel form than the author acknowledges.
