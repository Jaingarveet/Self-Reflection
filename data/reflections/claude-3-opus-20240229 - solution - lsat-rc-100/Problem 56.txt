Solution:
The passage discusses the contradiction between the Invisible Hand (diminishing returns, perfect competition) and the Pin Factory (increasing returns, tendency towards monopoly). Economists historically focused on the Invisible Hand because diminishing returns were easier to model mathematically than increasing returns.
The railroad industry is mentioned as an example of an industry characterized by increasing returns (the Pin Factory concept). This example illustrates that many real-world industries exhibit increasing returns, which contradicts the assumptions of the Invisible Hand. Therefore, the emphasis on the Invisible Hand in economic thought has shortcomings, as it fails to account for industries like railroads.
