- Assumption error
- Area calculation error

Solution:
The cow is tethered in the middle and moves in a circular pattern, but the area grazed is square-shaped. The square's side length is half of the rope length, so it's 7 feet. The area of the square field is 7*7 = 49 square feet. Therefore, it will take 49 / 10 = **4.9 days** for the cow to graze the whole field. The closest answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**.

Instructions:
1. Understand the movement pattern of the cow to define the shape of the grazed area. 
2. Calculate the side length of the square using the rope length provided. 
3. Calculate the area of the square field. 
4. Divide the total area by the amount of area grazed per day to find the number of days required. 
5. Choose the answer option that best approximates your calculated result. 

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully to identify the relevant information provided. 
- Understand the movement patterns and their implications on the problem. 
- Calculate dimensions and areas accurately, considering the shape formed. 
- Double-check your calculations and the problem's assumptions before finalizing your answer.
