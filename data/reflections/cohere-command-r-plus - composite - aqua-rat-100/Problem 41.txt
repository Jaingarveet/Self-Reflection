Solution:
Original contribution = Rs. 96 / n 

After 4 friends did not show up: 
New contribution = Rs. (96 + 4*4) / (n-4) = Rs. 144 / (n-4) 

We set up the equation: 
Rs. 144 / (n-4) = Rs. 96 / n + 4 

Multiplying both sides by (n-4) yields: 
144 = 96 + 4n 

Subtracting 96 from both sides: 
4[REDACTED] = 4n 

Dividing by 4: 
n = [REDACTED] 

The number of friends who attended the picnic is n = [REDACTED]. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: friends planned to spend a certain amount, but some didn't show up, increasing the cost for those who attended. 
2. Set up two equations: one for the original plan and one for the updated plan. 
3. Isolate for 'n' in both equations. 
4. Set the two equations equal to each other, representing the relationship between the original and updated plans. 
5. Simplify the equation and solve for 'n'. 
6. Interpret the result: 'n' is the total number of friends, so subtract 4 to find the number who attended. 

Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the relevant information. 
 - Clearly define variables and their meanings. 
 - Set up equations based on the relationships between variables. 
 - Always double-check your equation setup and variable isolation steps. 
 - Pay attention to the specific details of the question, such as whether it asks for the total or a subset.
