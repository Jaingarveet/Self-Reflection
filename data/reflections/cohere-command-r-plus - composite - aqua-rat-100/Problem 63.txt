Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and calculated the answer incorrectly. 
I calculated [REDACTED]% of 20, but the correct approach was to calculate the total number of matches and then find [REDACTED]% of that number. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Calculation error
- Percentage error

Solution:
The team won 20 matches, so they played a total of 100% * 20 matches = 100 matches. 
[REDACTED]% of 100 matches is 0.[REDACTED] * 100 = [REDACTED] matches lost. 
Therefore, the team lost [REDACTED] matches, and the correct answer is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully to understand the given information.
2. Identify the number of matches won and interpret "[REDACTED]% of their matches" as "[REDACTED]% of the total matches played."
[REDACTED]. Calculate the total number of matches played by the team.
4. Calculate the number of matches lost by multiplying the total number of matches by 0.[REDACTED].
[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the context of the problem.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and clarify the meaning of each statement.
- Understand the difference between "[REDACTED]% of X" and "[REDACTED]% of the total," and be mindful of such nuances in the questions.
- Calculate percentages accurately and practice common percentage calculations to improve your speed and accuracy.
