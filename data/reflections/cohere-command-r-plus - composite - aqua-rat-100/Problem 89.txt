Solution:
The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile. 

Let's calculate the cost for distances varying by a quarter-mile, starting from 1 quarter-mile and ending at 35 quarter-miles (9 miles), with a step of 1 quarter-mile. 

1/4 mile: $3.50
2/4 miles: $3.60
...
34/4 miles: $7.40
35/4 miles: $7.50

With a budget of $8.50, we can afford the fare up to 35/4 miles, which is equivalent to 8.75 miles. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], including the initial quarter-mile. 

Instructions:
1. Understand the question and identify the given information: initial charge, additional charge per unit distance, and budget. 
2. Recognize that the question asks for the maximum distance achievable with a given budget. 
3. Calculate the cost for each additional quarter-mile, not mile. 
4. Start from the initial distance and calculate the cost incrementally up to a reasonable distance, ensuring it doesn't exceed the budget. 
5. Determine the maximum distance achievable within the budget. 
6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated maximum distance. 

Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the specific units and charges. 
 - Understand the relationship between distance and cost to optimize distance within the budget. 
 - Be precise with units and calculations, ensuring they align with the question's context. 
 - Double-check your calculations and the question's specifics to avoid misinterpretations. 
 - Remember that the maximum distance is the greatest distance achievable within the given constraints.
