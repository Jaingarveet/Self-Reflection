Solution:

Let's assume Jack bought x white sharpeners and (18-x) brown sharpeners. 

From the question, we can write the equations: 

x + (18-x) = 18       (this is simply combining like terms, and it ensures the total number of sharpeners is 18)

x + 1 + (18-x) = 100  (the cost of white sharpeners is 1 rupee more, and the total cost is rs. 100)

Solving the equations, we find x = 10 and thus, 18-x = 8. 

Instructions:

1. Understand the variables: number of white sharpeners, number of brown sharpeners, and total cost. 
2. Set up the equations: one for the total number of sharpeners and another for the total cost, accounting for the price difference. 
3. Solve the system of equations to find the values of x and 18-x. 
4. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated values. 

Advice:

- Carefully interpret the problem and identify the relevant variables and their relationships. 
- Translate the problem into equations accurately, paying attention to the specific conditions given. 
- Double-check your equations to ensure they represent the problem correctly. 
- Solve the equations methodically, avoiding algebraic mistakes. 
- Always check your answer choices to ensure they align with your calculated values.
