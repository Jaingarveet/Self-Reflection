Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the cost price per bag and, consequently, the total number of bags sold. I forgot that the given profit is already a percentage of the selling price.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Percentage error
- Profit/cost calculation error

Solution:
Profit = 25% of Selling Price = 0.25 * $100 = $25
Cost Price = Selling Price - Profit = $100 - $25 = $75
Total Cost Price for all bags = Cost Price * number of bags = $75 * number of bags = $[REDACTED]00
Number of bags = $[REDACTED]00 / $75 = [REDACTED] bags

Number of bags sold = [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

Instructions:
1. Understand the relationship between selling price, profit, and cost price.
2. Calculate the profit per bag, given as a percentage of the selling price.
3. Calculate the cost price per bag by subtracting the profit from the selling price.
4. Set up the equation: total profit equals the cost price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold.
5. Solve for the number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the cost price per bag.

Advice:
- Understand the concept of profit, selling price, and cost price, and their relationships.
- Pay close attention to the units and percentages provided in the question.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure they align with the relationships defined in the problem.
