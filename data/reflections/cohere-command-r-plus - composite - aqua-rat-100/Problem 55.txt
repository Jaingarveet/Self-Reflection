Explanation:
I incorrectly set up and solved a system of equations. I made a simple arithmetic error in adding the equations and determining the value of "x." This led to an incorrect final answer.

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Arithmetic error
- Equation error

Solution:
Let the man's rate along the current be "x" kmph and the current's rate be "y" kmph.
We can set up a system of equations based on the given information:
x - y = 2 (the man's rate against the current)
x + y = 4 (the man's rate in still water)

Adding these equations, we get:
2x = 6
x = 3

Substituting x into the equation x + y = 4:
3 + y = 4
y = 1

Now, we can find the man's rate along the current:
x = 3 kmph

Therefore, the correct answer is **[REDACTED]: 3 kmph**.

Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: the man's rates in still water and against the current.
2. Define variables: let 'x' be the man's rate along the current and 'y' be the current's rate.
3. Set up a system of equations: use the given rates to create two equations.
4. Solve the system: add the equations to find the value of 'x'.
5. Substitute and solve: use the value of 'x' to find 'y' by substituting into the second equation.
6. Interpret the result: the man's rate along the current is 'x' kmph.

Advice:
 - Clearly define variables and their meanings.
 - Set up equations precisely and double-check them.
 - Solve the system of equations accurately, checking each step.
 - Interpret the solution correctly, ensuring it makes sense in the context of the problem.
