Explanation:
I incorrectly applied the square root to find the side length of the square. I should have divided the total area of the rectangle by the length of the side of the square, not taken the square root of the area. This is a common mistake when dealing with geometric transformations and area calculations.

Error Keywords:
- Geometric transformation error
- Area calculation error
- Square root error

Solution:
The total area of the rectangle is 27 cm x 17 cm = 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. When the rectangle is rebent into a square, the area remains the same. Therefore, the area of the square is also 45[REDACTED] sq. cm. 

To find the length of one side of the square, we divide the area by the length of one side: 
45[REDACTED] sq. cm / side = side^2

side^2 = 45[REDACTED]
side = √45[REDACTED] ≈ 21.4 cm

Since we need an integer side length, we round down to the nearest integer: 21 cm.

Instructions:
1. Calculate the area of the rectangle (length x breadth). 
2. Recognize that the area of the rectangle and the square are equal since it is the same wire rebent. 
3. Set up the equation: area of the square = side x side. 
4. Divide the total area by the length of one side to find the side length. 
5. Check your calculations and ensure you have not taken the square root. 
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result. 

Advice:
- Understand the properties of geometric shapes and how they transform. 
- Pay attention to the units in the problem and ensure they are consistent throughout your calculations. 
- Be careful with square roots and exponents; they are easily confused. 
- Double-check your calculations and ensure you are solving for the correct variable.
