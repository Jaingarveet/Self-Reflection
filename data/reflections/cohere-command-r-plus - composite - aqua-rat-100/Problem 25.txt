Explanation:
I incorrectly applied the trigonometric identities and made a mistake in simplifying the final expression. I should have paid closer attention to the identities and been more careful in my algebraic manipulations.

Error Keywords:
- Trigonometric identity error
- Algebraic simplification error
- Incorrect variable substitution

Solution:
Let's denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as $x$. Using trigonometry, we can set up the following equations:
$\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = h$
$\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10} \implies h = (x - 10)\tan(60^{\circ})$

Setting these equations equal to each other and solving for $x$, we get:
$x = h = (x - 10)\tan(60^{\circ})$
$x = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1)$

Now, we can find how much farther the car has to travel:
$x - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1) - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} - 2 + 1) = 5(\sqrt{3} + 1 - 2) = 5(\sqrt{3} - 1)$

Therefore, it will take $\mathbf{5(\sqrt{3} - 1)}$ more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower, which is choice $\mathbf{A}$.

Instructions:
1. Denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base as $x$.
2. Set up trigonometric equations using the angles and ratios: $\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x}$ and $\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10}$.
3. Equate these equations and solve for $x$ to find the distance traveled.
4. Calculate the remaining distance by subtracting the time passed (10 minutes) from the total distance ($x$).
5. Simplify the expression and choose the answer option that matches your result.

Advice:
- Carefully apply trigonometric identities and simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step to avoid errors.
- Double-check your variable substitutions and calculations.
- Be cautious when dealing with square roots and similar numbers; ensure you don't mistakenly switch or omit any terms.
