Explanation:
I made a mistake in equating the number of pita breads to the number of rolls. I should have equated it to the number of baguettes. As a result, I incorrectly calculated the final answer.

Error Keywords:
- Equivalence error
- Comparison error
- Calculation error

Solution:
Given:
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes

Step 1: Find the equivalence for [REDACTED] baguettes:
[REDACTED] baguettes = 5/[REDACTED] rolls (given: [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes)

Step [REDACTED]: Find the equivalence for 5/[REDACTED] rolls in pita breads:
5/[REDACTED] rolls = 6/5 * 5/[REDACTED] pita breads = [REDACTED] pita breads

Therefore, [REDACTED] baguettes are equivalent to [REDACTED] pita breads.

Instructions:
1. Understand the given equivalences: 6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls, and [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes.
[REDACTED]. Find the equivalence for [REDACTED] baguettes in terms of rolls.
[REDACTED]. Use the given equivalence to find the equivalence of that number of rolls in pita breads.
4. Express the final answer in the simplest form.

Advice:
- Carefully read and understand the relationships given in the question.
- Identify the relevant information and equivalences that will help you solve the problem.
- Systematically work through the problem, step-by-step, using the given information.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are making the correct comparisons and equivalences.
- Simplify your final answer if possible.
