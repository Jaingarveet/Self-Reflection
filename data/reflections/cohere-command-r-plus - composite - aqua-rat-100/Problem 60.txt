Solution:
Given that [REDACTED] bisects minor arc A[REDACTED], minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] (as minor arc A[REDACTED] is [REDACTED]). 
To find minor arc B[REDACTED]: 
minor arc B[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] 
minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] 
minor arc B[REDACTED] = [REDACTED]. 

Now, to find minor arc A[REDACTED]: 
minor arc A[REDACTED] = minor arc A[REDACTED] + minor arc B[REDACTED] 
minor arc A[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] 
minor arc A[REDACTED] = 240°. 

The measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is 240°, which is greater than 1[REDACTED] (half the circle). This indicates that minor arc A[REDACTED] is actually a major arc, and its measure as a minor arc is the complementary angle, which is 1[REDACTED] - 240° = 40°. 

So, minor arc A[REDACTED] = 40°. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given values for minor arcs A[REDACTED], B[REDACTED], and the bisected minor arc A[REDACTED] (and BC). 
2. Calculate the measure of minor arc B[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. 
3. Find the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] by adding the measures of minor arcs A[REDACTED] and B[REDACTED]. 
4. Check if the measure of minor arc A[REDACTED] is greater than half the circle's circumference (1[REDACTED]). 
5. If it is greater, subtract the measure from 1[REDACTED] to find the complementary angle, which represents the minor arc A[REDACTED]. 

Advice:
 - Read the question carefully and identify the given geometric relationships and values. 
 - Draw a diagram if needed to visualize the problem. 
 - Perform calculations step-by-step, ensuring you apply the correct geometric rules and formulas. 
 - Double-check your calculations and the final answer, considering any special cases or constraints. 
 - Remember that when an arc bisects another, their measures are equal, and the sum of their measures equals the measure of the whole arc.
