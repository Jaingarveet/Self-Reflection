Solution:

Let's assume John has x amount of money. 

According to Mark, if John gives him half of John's money, Mark will have Rs. 75. So, from Mark's perspective: 
John's contribution = 1/2 * x
Mark already had: 75 - (1/2)x

According to John, if he receives one-third of Mark's money, he will have Rs. 75. So, from John's perspective: 
John's original amount + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75
This can be written as: x + (1/3)(2x - 75) = 75

Now, we can solve for x: 
75 = x + (2/3)x - 25
75 = (5/3)x - 25
100 = (5/3)x
x = [REDACTED]

Instructions:
1. Identify the variables: let John's money = x
2. Interpret Mark's statement: from Mark's perspective, after receiving half of John's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's contribution + Mark's original money = Rs. 75
3. Interpret John's statement: from John's perspective, after receiving one-third of Mark's money, he has Rs. 75. Set up the equation: John's original money + (1/3) of Mark's money = Rs. 75
4. Solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation
5. Plug the value of x back into the equations to find Mark's original money
6. Calculate the answer choices to check which one matches our calculated amount

Advice:
 - Always read and interpret the information given in the question carefully. 
 - Use consistent and clear variables for each person or object involved in the problem. 
 - Set up equations based on the perspective of each person or object involved. 
 - Double-check your equations and calculations to ensure they align with the information given in the question. 
 - Solve one step at a time and regularly check your work to catch errors early on.
