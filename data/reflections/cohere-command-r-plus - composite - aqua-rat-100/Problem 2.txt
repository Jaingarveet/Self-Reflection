Solution:
The average of the 10 vehicles' weights is $12.2$ tons, so their total weight is $10 \times 12.2 = 122$ tons. After adding the new truck, the average weight increased to $12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8$ tons, and the total weight increased to $14.8 \times 11 = 162.8$ tons. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is $162.8 - 122 = \mathbf{[REDACTED]}$ tons. 

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles by multiplying the average weight by the number of vehicles.
2. Calculate the new average weight by adding the given increase.
3. Calculate the total weight of the new group by multiplying the new average weight by the new number of vehicles (original + 1).
4. Find the weight of the new truck by subtracting the original total weight from the new total weight.
5. Check your calculations and ensure the answer choice matches your calculated result.
