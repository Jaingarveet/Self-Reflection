Solution:

Given:
- RS = 5
- RT = 1[REDACTED]
- ST = 22

We want to find RU. 

Since U is the midpoint of ST, then:
- UT = 22 / 2 = 11

Now, we can find RU:
- RU = RT - UT = 1[REDACTED] - 11 = [REDACTED]

So, the length of line segment RU is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST, and the fact that U is the midpoint of ST.
2. Identify the goal: find the length of RU.
3. Calculate UT since U is the midpoint of ST (divide ST by 2).
4. Find RU by subtracting UT from RT.
5. Double-check your calculations and the units used.

Advice:
- Read the question carefully and identify the given information and the goal.
- Draw a diagram if it helps visualize the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller steps to avoid confusion.
- Pay attention to keywords like "midpoint" and their geometric meanings.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure you're performing the correct mathematical operations.
