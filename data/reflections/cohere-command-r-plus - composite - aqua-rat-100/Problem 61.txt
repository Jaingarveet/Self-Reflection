Solution:

Let the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] be $x$ miles. 
Kevin drives at $70$ mph for $\frac{x}{70}$ hours. 
Then, he immediately drives back at $[REDACTED]$ mph for the same distance, taking $\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}$ hours. 
The total trip time is thus $\frac{x}{70} + \frac{x}{[REDACTED]} = \frac{16x}{630} = \frac{8x}{315}$. 

$3$ hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching [REDACTED]. 
At this point, he had traveled for $\frac{8x}{315} - \frac{17}{6} = \frac{1}{6}$ hours. 
During this time, he covered the distance $(70 \text{ mph}) \times (\frac{1}{6} \text{ hour}) = \frac{35}{3}$ miles. 

The remaining distance to [REDACTED] is $70$ miles, so the total distance from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] is $x = \frac{35}{3} + 70 = 175$ miles. 
Therefore, the correct answer is $[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]$ miles. 

Instructions:
1. Identify the given values: speed to location [REDACTED] ($70$ mph), speed returning to location [REDACTED] ($[REDACTED]$ mph), and time before the end of the trip when he was still approaching [REDACTED] ($3$ hours). 
2. Define the unknown value: let the distance between locations [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] be $x$ miles. 
3. Calculate the time taken to travel from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] and from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], and express them in terms of $x$. 
4. Find the total trip time by adding the two times calculated in step 3. 
5. Set up an equation: the total trip time minus the time spent before arriving at [REDACTED] should equal the time it takes to cover the remaining $70$ miles. 
6. Solve the equation for $x$ to find the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. 
7. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result. 

Advice:
 - Identify all given values and clearly define unknowns. 
 - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. 
 - Translate words into mathematical expressions and equations. 
 - Always double-check your equations and ensure they accurately represent the problem. 
 - Solve equations step-by-step to avoid errors in algebraic manipulation. 
 - Pay attention to units and ensure they are consistent throughout your calculations. 
 - Practice similar types of problems to improve your familiarity and accuracy.
