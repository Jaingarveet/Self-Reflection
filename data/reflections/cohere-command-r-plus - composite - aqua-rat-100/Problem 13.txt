Error Keywords:
- Algebraic error
- Simplification error
- Fraction manipulation error

Solution:
Let the number be x. We can represent the problem with the equation: 
(7/18)x = (7/8)x - 770

Now, we can simplify and solve for x: 
(7/18)x + 770 = (7/8)x
(7/18 + 7/8)x = 770 * 18/8
(63/72)x = 770 * 9/8
(7/8)x = 770 * 9
x = (770 * 9) * (8/7)
x = [REDACTED]

Instructions:
1. Set up the equation: (7/18)x = (7/8)x - 770
2. Simplify the equation: (7/18)x + 770 = (7/8)x
3. Continue simplifying: (63/72)x = 770 * 9/8
4. Simplify further: (7/8)x = 770 * 9
5. Solve for x: x = (770 * 9) * (8/7)
6. Calculate the value of x: x = [REDACTED]

Advice:
 - Always distribute multiplication over addition/subtraction when simplifying equations. 
 - Take your time when manipulating fractions to avoid errors. 
 - Double-check your calculations and simplify fractions where possible. 
 - Be cautious when solving for a variable; ensure you are isolating it correctly.
