Error Keywords:
- Mathematical error
- Order of operations error
- Simplification error

Solution: Step-by-step calculation:
1. [[REDACTED] + X × 19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[13^2 - 1[REDACTED]6] = 6
2. X × 19 = 1[REDACTED] + 7 - [REDACTED] = 17
3. X = 17/19
[REDACTED]. [[REDACTED] + 17/19 × 19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[169 - 1[REDACTED]6] = 6
[REDACTED]. Simplify inside the brackets first: [217/19 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[12] = 6
6. Continue calculation inside the brackets: [11.[REDACTED]2 - 1[REDACTED] - 7]/[12] = 6
7. Calculate the numerator: [-3.[REDACTED]8 - 7]/[12] = 6
8. Calculate the numerator: [-10.[REDACTED]8]/[12] = 6
9. Divide: -10.[REDACTED]8/12 = -0.881666 = 6

The equation does not hold true, so the correct answer is "[REDACTED]: There is no such value of X."

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the given equation and the values to be calculated.
2. Simplify the equation step-by-step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
3. Calculate the value of X accurately, ensuring correct division.
[REDACTED]. Plug the value of X back into the original equation and simplify.
[REDACTED]. Check if the equation holds true when both sides are equal to 6.
6. If the equation holds true, choose the appropriate answer option; otherwise, select "no such value."

Advice:
- Always follow the correct order of operations to avoid errors in simplification.
- Pay attention to fractions and divisions; ensure you perform calculations accurately.
- Double-check your calculations and the final answer.
- Read the question and answer options carefully to understand the task fully.
