Solution:
The initial group has 64 boys and 40 girls, totaling 104 members. During the drive, an equal number of boys and girls joined to establish a new ratio of 4:3 (boys to girls). 

To find the total number of members now, we can use the ratio: 
Total members = (4/7) * Initial members 
Total members = (4/7) * 104 
Total members = [REDACTED]

Instructions:
1. Calculate the initial total number of members (boys + girls). 
2. Recognize that the new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which can be simplified to 4/7 for boys and 3/7 for girls. 
3. Set up the equation: Total members = (4/7) * Initial members. 
4. Plug in the value of the initial members and calculate the final answer. 

Advice:
- Understand the concept of ratios and how they are used to represent parts of a whole. 
- Recognize that the ratio represents the fractional relationship between boys and girls in the group. 
- Ensure you correctly set up equations involving ratios and proportions. 
- Double-check your calculations and the setup of your equations.
