Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the passage supported the statement that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. 
While the passage does state that high lipid levels are dangerous and contribute to premature heart disease, it does not explicitly link them to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. 
Instead, the passage focuses on the effects of alcohol on lipid processing and the potential benefits of wine consumption on these factors.
