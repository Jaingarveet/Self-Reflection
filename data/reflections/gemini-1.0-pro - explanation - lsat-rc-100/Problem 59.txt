Explanation:
I incorrectly inferred that the test case strategy was a [REDACTED] component of public interest litigation. 
The passage states that the test case strategy was a novel approach developed by Marshall and the NAACP. 
I failed to recognize the distinction between a [REDACTED] component and a novel approach.
