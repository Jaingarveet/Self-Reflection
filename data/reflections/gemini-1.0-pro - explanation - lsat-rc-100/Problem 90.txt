Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the excerpt that exhibits the author's attitude toward the novel Jazz. 
I focused on the author's praise for the novel's connection to music, narrative structure, and linguistic virtuosity. 
However, I overlooked the excerpt that describes the narrator as "disembodied" and "protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole." 
This excerpt suggests that the author may be critical of the narrator's detachment and control.
