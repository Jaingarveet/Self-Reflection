Explanation:
I focused on finding a structure that matched the pattern "All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]" but neglected to consider the direction of the implication. The correct structure should be "All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED], [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED], therefore [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]".
