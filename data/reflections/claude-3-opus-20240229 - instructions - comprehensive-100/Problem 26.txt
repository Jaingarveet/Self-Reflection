Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and note all given information and constraints.
2. Consider each answer choice one by one.
3. For each choice, try to construct a possible arrangement that satisfies all constraints.
4. If you can find a valid arrangement, the choice could be true. If any constraint is violated, the choice must be false.
5. Eliminate choices that violate constraints or for which no valid arrangement can be made.
6. Select the choice that remains as the correct answer.
7. Double-check your reasoning to ensure you haven't missed any possibilities or constraints.
