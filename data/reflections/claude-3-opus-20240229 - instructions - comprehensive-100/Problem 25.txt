Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints.
2. Evaluate each answer choice one by one.
3. For each answer choice, verify that it satisfies each constraint.
4. If an answer choice violates any constraint, eliminate it.
5. If an answer choice satisfies all constraints, it could be the correct answer.
6. After evaluating all answer choices, select the one that satisfies all constraints.
7. Double-check your selected answer to ensure it indeed satisfies all constraints.
