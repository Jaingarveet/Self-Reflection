Instructions:
1. Identify the individuals who are not giving reports and eliminate them from consideration.
2. Identify any individuals with specific constraints on when they can give reports and slot them in accordingly.
3. Identify any individuals with constraints on the type of report (morning or afternoon) they can give.
4. Work through the implications of each constraint step-by-step.
5. Consider each day sequentially, eliminating possibilities that would violate the constraints.
6. If a constraint leads to an impossible situation, backtrack and reconsider your previous assumptions.
7. Once you have slotted in all constrained individuals, fill in the remaining slots with the remaining individuals.
