Instructions:
1. Identify the width of each picket.
2. Identify the width of the space between pickets.
3. Calculate the total width of one picket plus one space.
4. Determine the number of spaces for x pickets (it's x-1, not x).
5. Calculate the total length by:
   - Multiplying the number of pickets by the width of each picket
   - Multiplying the number of spaces by the width of each space
   - Adding these two results
6. If needed, convert the total length to the requested units by dividing.
7. Simplify the resulting expression if possible.
8. Select the answer choice that matches your expression.
