Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints multiple times.
2. Identify the fixed constraints (e.g., George's report must be on Tuesday).
3. Consider each person mentioned in the question and the constraints on when they can give their report.
4. Methodically consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the constraints.
5. Do not prematurely eliminate any scenarios unless they clearly violate a constraint.
6. Check each answer choice against the possible scenarios to find one that could be true.
