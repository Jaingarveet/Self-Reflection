  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. 
I incorrectly subtracted $z$ from both sides of the equation, which led me to the wrong solution.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Subtraction error
 - Equation manipulation error
Solution:
The equation is $2z + 1 = z$.
Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $2z = z - 1$.
Subtracting $z$ from both sides gives $z = -1$.
Therefore, the value of $z$ that satisfies the equation is -1.
Instructions:
1. Read the equation carefully.
2. Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate $z$.
3. Subtract $z$ from both sides to find the value of $z$.
4. Check your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.
Advice:
 - Always read the equation carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always work step-by-step through your calculations.
 - Always check your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.
 - Be careful when subtracting quantities with different signs.
 - Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
