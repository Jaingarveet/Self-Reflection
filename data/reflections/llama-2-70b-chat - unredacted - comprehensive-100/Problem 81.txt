  Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is D: Note that this is where the registration renewal forms will get sent, so make sure the person is willing and able to take that action down the line. On line 14b, put the address where the car will be stored or parked.

The text states that the person registering the car will not need to enter their plate number and can leave it blank or print it out. Therefore, option C is not the correct answer.

Option A is not related to the text, and option B is not mentioned in the text.

Option D is the correct answer, as it mentions the address where the car will be stored or parked, which is relevant to the text.
