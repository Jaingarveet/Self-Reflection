  Action: Answer(D)

The passage states that the diversity of secondary substances in a plant population is not directly proportional to the number of insects with which that plant population has interacted throughout its evolutionary history. Instead, the passage suggests that the diversity of secondary substances is the result of an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects, where plants develop defenses against insects through the production of secondary substances, and insects evolve ways to circumvent these defenses.

Therefore, choice A is incorrect, as it suggests a direct proportional relationship between the number of insects and the diversity of secondary substances, which is not supported by the passage.

Choice B is incorrect because, while some species of plants may have benefited from evolutionary interaction with insects, many species of insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' chemical defenses, which suggests that plants have been affected by their interactions with insects.

Choice C is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention any changes in the number of plant species within each family or the number of families of plants.

Choice D is the correct answer, as it states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species. This is supported by the passage, which explains that insects have played a role in the development and distribution of secondary substances in plants.

Finally, choice E is incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about insects evolving immunity to plants' secondary substances. Instead, it states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent plants' defenses, which suggests that they have developed mechanisms to avoid or detoxify the harmful effects of these substances.
