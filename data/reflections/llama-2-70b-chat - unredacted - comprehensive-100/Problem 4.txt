  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the length of the space shuttle.
I incorrectly used the formula L = vht, where vh is the horizontal speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
Instead, I should have used the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 975 m.

Error Keywords:
- Formula error
- Calculation error
- Velocity error

Solution:
1. The space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
2. It takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its horizontal speed is 700/5 = 140 m/s.
3. The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
4. The length of the space shuttle (L) can be found using the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds in this case).
5. Substituting the values, we get L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 975 m.

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 975 m, which corresponds to choice C: 100 m.

Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for the length of an object passing a point: L = vt.
2. Identify the total speed of the object: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
3. Substitute the values into the formula: L = 195 m/s x 5 s.
4. Solve for L: L = 975 m.
5. Compare the calculated length to the given choices and select the corresponding answer.

Advice:
- Always choose the correct formula for the problem at hand.
- Always work through the calculation step-by-step, ensuring accuracy.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the length of an object passing a point can be found using the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
