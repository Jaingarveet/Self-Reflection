Solution:
1. The question asks for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies *without* colony collapse disorder.
2. We need to focus on the third column of the table, which represents colonies without colony collapse disorder.
3. While [REDACTED] shows 81%, the last row indicates that "All four pathogens" were present in 100% of the colonies without colony collapse disorder.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as it is one of the four pathogens that collectively infected 100% of the colonies without colony collapse disorder.
