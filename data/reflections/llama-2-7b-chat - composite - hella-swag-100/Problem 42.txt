Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) What differentiates your product from other similar products? To help your product stand apart from the rest, you'll need to find a niche.

The passage suggests that starting an online business gives you access to millions of customers, but also increased competition. To stand out from the competition, it's important to identify what makes your product unique and valuable. This could be a specific feature, quality, or target market that sets your product apart from similar products.

The other options in the question do not address the key point of differentiating your product:

Option (A) is too broad and does not provide a clear solution to the problem.
Option (B) is a step in the process of building an existing business, but does not directly address the issue of product differentiation.
Option (C) is a good point to consider, but it does not provide a clear answer to the question.
Option (D) is the correct answer because it directly addresses the problem of product differentiation and provides a specific solution.
