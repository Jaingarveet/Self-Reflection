Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation for the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers when checking the number [REDACTED].
The sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers starting from [REDACTED] is [REDACTED] + 43 + 45 + [REDACTED] + 49 = 225, which is not divisible by 10.
The correct calculation for the sum of the 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5x + 10, where x is the middle number.
