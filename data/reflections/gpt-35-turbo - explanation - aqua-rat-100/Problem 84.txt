Explanation:
I correctly identified that there are only two possible arrangements: Susan-Tim-Zen or Tim-Susan-Zen. However, I did not consider that the chairs are identical, so there is only one way to arrange the children on each of the two possible arrangements. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
