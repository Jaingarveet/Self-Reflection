Explanation:
The man can catch either the harbor line or the main line train, so we need to calculate the probability of him catching either one of them.
The main line train starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it will arrive at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on.
The harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it will arrive at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on.
The man will catch the first train if he arrives at the station before both trains have already left.
The probability of the man catching the main line train is [REDACTED] because the main line train starts at 5:00 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it will arrive at 5:00, 5:10, 5:20, and so on. The man has a 9 out of 10 chance of arriving before the main line train leaves.
The probability of the man catching the harbor line train is [REDACTED] because the harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM and has a frequency of 10 minutes, which means it will arrive at 5:02, 5:12, 5:22, and so on. The man has an 8 out of 10 chance of arriving before the harbor line train leaves.
The probability of the man catching either the main line or the harbor line train is the sum of the probabilities of him catching each train, minus the probability of him catching both trains. The probability of him catching both trains is the product of the probabilities of him catching each train.
So, the probability of the man catching either the main line or the harbor line train is:
[REDACTED] + [REDACTED] - ([REDACTED] * [REDACTED]) = [REDACTED]8
Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is [REDACTED]8.
