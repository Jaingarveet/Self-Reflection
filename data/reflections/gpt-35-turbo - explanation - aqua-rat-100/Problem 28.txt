Explanation:
My thought process was correct, but I made a calculation error.
The probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.56 x 0.74 = 0.4144.
The probability that at least one of the events will occur is 1 - 0.4144 = 0.5856.
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 1 - 0.5856 = 0.4144.
The correct answer is [REDACTED].
