Explanation:
I made a mistake in assuming that the answer must be one of the given choices. 
The correct answer is "[REDACTED]" because none of the given choices satisfy the conditions of the problem. 
To find the minimum number of students, we need to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies both equations. 
We can start by assuming that x is a multiple of 100, since 20% and 28% are multiples of 100. 
If x = 500, then 20% of x is 100 and 28% of x is 140, which means that there are at least 240 students in the school. 
If x = [REDACTED], then 20% of x is 120 and 28% of x is 168, which means that there are at least 288 students in the school. 
If x = [REDACTED], then 20% of x is 140 and 28% of x is 196, which means that there are at least 336 students in the school. 
Therefore, the minimum possible value of x is [REDACTED], and the correct answer is "[REDACTED]".
