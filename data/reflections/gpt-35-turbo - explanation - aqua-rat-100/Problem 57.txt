Explanation:
I correctly calculated the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds, but I made an error in calculating the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade. 
I multiplied the circumference of the circle with a radius of 10 centimeters by the number of revolutions made by the fan blade in 30 seconds, but I forgot to multiply by 2 because the point on the edge of the fan blade travels the circumference of the circle twice in one revolution.
