Advice:
 - Understand the logic behind the argument and identify any assumptions or connections between variables. 
 - To weaken an argument, look for evidence that contradicts its assumptions or shows that other factors may play a more significant role. 
 - Evaluate each choice based on its effectiveness in refuting the argument, not just its relevance to the topic. 
 - Consider the magnitude and significance of the discrepancies presented in the options. 
 - Remember that the goal is to find the option that casts the most doubt on the assertion, not just provide alternative explanations.
