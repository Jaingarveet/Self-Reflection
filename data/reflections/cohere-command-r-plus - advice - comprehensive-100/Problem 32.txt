Advice:
 - Focus on the structure and reasoning of the argument, not just the content. 
 - Recognize common logical fallacies, such as rejecting a claim based on insufficient argumentation. 
 - Evaluate each answer choice critically and precisely, ensuring they align with the identified flaw. 
 - Avoid assumptions and focus on what is explicitly stated in the argument. 
 - Always read and understand the question stem to identify the specific aspect of the argument being evaluated.
