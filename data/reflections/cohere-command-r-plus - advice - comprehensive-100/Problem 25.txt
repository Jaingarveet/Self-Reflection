Advice:
- Read and understand all the constraints before starting. 
- Prioritize the constraints and tackle them one by one. 
- Start with the constraints that have a definite placement, like the pharmacy and restaurant in this case. 
- Work systematically through the remaining constraints. 
- Double-check your final arrangement against all constraints. 
- Be mindful of negative constraints (e.g., "cannot be next to") and ensure you interpret them correctly.
