## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial approach was correct in identifying U as the midpoint of ST and calculating the length of SU as 11. However, I made a crucial error in adding the lengths of RS and SU to find RU. Since U is the midpoint, the length of RU is actually half the length of ST, not the sum of RS and SU.
**Error Keywords:**
* Misinterpretation of midpoint concept
* Addition instead of division for midpoint calculation
* Failure to consider midpoint property in final calculation
**Solution:**
1. Identify U as the midpoint of ST.
2. Calculate the length of SU as half the length of ST: 22 / 2 = 11.
3. Recognize that RU is half the length of ST due to U being the midpoint.
4. Calculate the length of RU: 22 / 2 = 11.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. Carefully read and understand the definition of midpoint.
2. Remember that the midpoint divides a line segment into two segments of equal length.
3. When dealing with midpoints, focus on division rather than addition to find lengths of related segments.
4. Double-check calculations and interpretations to ensure they align with the problem's context.
**General Advice:**
* Visualize the problem using diagrams or sketches.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Apply relevant formulas and properties accurately.
* Pay close attention to keywords and specific details in the problem statement.
* Don't rush; take your time to think through each step logically.
