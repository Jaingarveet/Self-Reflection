## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the variability of allergens among individuals while overlooking the passage's statement about the variability of proteins in cats themselves. 
**Error Keywords:**
* **Overlooking information:** I failed to consider all relevant information in the passage.
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the passage's statement about individual allergens as implying a difference in allergens across all cats.
* **Incomplete analysis:** My analysis was incomplete, focusing on only one aspect of the information provided.
**Solution:**
1. **Identify key information:** The passage states that:
    * Allergic reactions are caused by proteins in cat skin secretions and saliva.
    * The specific proteins responsible vary from person to person.
    * All cats shed skin and spread saliva, so no cat is incapable of causing allergic reactions.
    * Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
2. **Analyze the information:** 
    * The variability of allergens among individuals explains why different people react to different cats.
    * The variability of proteins in cats explains why some cats are more likely to trigger allergies in certain individuals.
3. **Choose the most strongly supported statement:** 
    * Statement C directly reflects the passage's information about protein variability in cats.
    * Other statements may be partially true but are not as strongly supported by the passage.
**Instructions for Future:**
1. **Read carefully and identify key information.**
2. **Analyze all relevant information, not just a subset.**
3. **Consider all answer choices and choose the one most strongly supported by the information.**
4. **Be aware of potential biases and misinterpretations.**
5. **Double-check your reasoning and conclusions.**
**General Advice:**
* **Break down complex information into smaller, more manageable parts.**
* **Use active reading strategies to identify key points and supporting evidence.**
* **Consider alternative interpretations and potential biases.**
* **Be willing to revise your understanding as you learn new information.**
* **Practice applying these strategies to different types of problems.**
By following these steps and reflecting on my mistakes, I can improve my ability to analyze information and answer questions accurately in the future.
