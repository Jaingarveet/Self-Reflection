Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that aminoacyl t-RNA is required for all amino acids to be incorporated into proteins. However, hydroxylysine is an exception. It is formed by post-translational modification of lysine, not by direct translation from mRNA.
Error Keywords:
- Overgeneralization
- Incomplete knowledge
- Exception not considered
Solution:
1. Identify the amino acid in question.
2. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA or formed by post-translational modification.
3. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA, then aminoacyl t-RNA is required.
4. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, then aminoacyl t-RNA is not required.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the amino acid in question.
2. Recall your knowledge of amino acid biosynthesis and post-translational modifications.
3. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA or formed by post-translational modification.
4. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRNA, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RNA is required.
5. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RNA is not required.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with your reasoning.
Advice:
- Be aware of exceptions to general rules.
- Maintain a comprehensive understanding of biochemical pathways and modifications.
- Carefully consider all answer choices before making a selection.
- If unsure, research the specific amino acid or pathway to clarify its requirements.
