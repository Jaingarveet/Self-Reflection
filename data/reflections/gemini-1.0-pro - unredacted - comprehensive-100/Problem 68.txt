Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the slope of a line passing through the origin is always undefined. 
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the concept of slope and how it relates to the origin. 
I knew how to calculate the slope, but I did not consider the special case of a line passing through the origin.

Solution:
The slope of the line determined by the points $(2, k)$ and $(k, 32)$ is $\frac{32-k}{k-2}$.
The line passes through the origin, which means it has a slope of $\frac{0}{0}$.
To find the value of $k$ that makes the slope undefined, we set the denominator of the slope equation to zero.
$k-2=0$
$k=2$
However, $k=2$ is not a valid solution because it would make the denominator of the slope equation zero, resulting in an undefined slope.
Therefore, there is no value of $k$ that makes the slope of the line undefined.
Instructions:
1. Identify the two points that determine the line.
2. Calculate the slope of the line using the slope formula.
3. Set the slope equation equal to zero to find the value of $k$ that makes the slope undefined.
4. Check if the calculated value of $k$ is a valid solution by ensuring that it does not make the denominator of the slope equation zero.
5. If the calculated value of $k$ is not a valid solution, conclude that there is no value of $k$ that makes the slope of the line undefined.
Advice:
 - Always consider special cases when solving problems.
 - Double-check your calculations and reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the slope of a line passing through the origin is always zero, not undefined.
