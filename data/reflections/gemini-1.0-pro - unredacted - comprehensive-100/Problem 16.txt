## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My initial analysis was correct in identifying the key information and potential candidates. However, I made a crucial error in assuming that only one person could be both tall and handsome. This led me to incorrectly eliminate Wu Gang as a possibility.
**Error Keywords:**
* Oversimplification
* Assumption error
* Incomplete analysis
## Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Identify key information:**
    * 3 tall men, 2 doctors, 1 handsome
    * Wang Wei and Wu Gang are doctors
    * Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height
    * Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall
2. **Analyze possibilities:**
    * Wang Wei and Wu Gang cannot be handsome (both doctors)
    * Either Liu Dawei or Li Qiang must be tall (not both Li Qiang and Wang Wei)
    * One person can be both tall and handsome
3. **Consider all options:**
    * Liu Dawei: Could be tall, handsome, and a doctor (符合条件)
    * Li Qiang: Could be tall and a doctor, but not handsome (排除)
    * Wu Gang: Could be tall and handsome, but not a doctor (排除)
    * Wang Wei: Could be handsome and a doctor, but not tall (排除)
4. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only Liu Dawei fulfills all requirements.
