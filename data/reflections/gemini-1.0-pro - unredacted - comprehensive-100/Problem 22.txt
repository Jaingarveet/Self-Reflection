Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Nina's report could not be on Wednesday. 
I overlooked the exception in the rule about Nina's report. 
I focused too much on the constraint about Nina's report and did not consider the possibility that the exception could apply.
Error Keywords:
 - Rule-based reasoning error
 - Exception handling error
 - Overlooking exception
Solution:
George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days.
George can only give a report on Tuesday.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday.
Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
Nina's report cannot be on Wednesday because George and Robert are giving reports on the other two days.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
Since Nina gives a report on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
Therefore, Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
