Explanation:
I incorrectly inferred that the test case strategy was necessary based on the passage stating that it was "unprecedented." While the strategy was indeed unprecedented, the passage does not explicitly state that it was necessary.
Error Keywords:
 - Inference error
 - Assumption error
 - Logic error
Solution:
The passage states that Marshall and the NAACP "set up a predetermined legal campaign that was meticulously crafted and carefully coordinated."
The test case strategy is described as a "tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision."
This suggests that the test case strategy was not arbitrary, inflexible, or subjective.
The passage also states that the test case strategy was "unprecedented."
Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that the author views the test case strategy developed by Marshall as unprecedented.
Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and identify the key points.
2. Identify the question being asked.
3. Consider all of the answer choices and eliminate those that are clearly incorrect.
4. Carefully analyze the remaining answer choices and select the one that is most consistent with the information in the passage.
5. Do not make assumptions or inferences that are not explicitly supported by the passage.
Advice:
 - Be cautious about making inferences or assumptions that are not explicitly supported by the text.
 - Carefully consider all of the answer choices before making a selection.
 - If you are unsure about an answer, it is often helpful to eliminate the choices that you know are incorrect.
 - Pay attention to the wording of the question and the answer choices.
 - Be aware of common logical fallacies, such as assuming the conclusion or begging the question.
