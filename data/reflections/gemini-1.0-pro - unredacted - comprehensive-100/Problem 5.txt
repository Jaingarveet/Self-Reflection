Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the ages of the members. I used the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, but I did not take into account the fact that the youngest member is 7 years old.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Arithmetic series error
 - Age calculation error
Solution:
Let the number of members in the club be n.
Then, the sum of the ages of all the members = 7 + (7 + 3) + (7 + 6) + ... + (7 + 3(n - 1))
= n(7 + 3(n - 1))/2
= 250
=> n(7 + 3n - 3) = 500
=> n(3n + 4) = 500
=> 3n^2 + 4n - 500 = 0
=> 3n^2 + 30n - 26n - 500 = 0
=> 3n(n + 10) - 26(n + 10) = 0
=> (3n - 26)(n + 10) = 0
=> n = 26 or n = -10
Since, the number of members cannot be negative, therefore n = 26.
The sum of the ages of the members is 250.
The average age of the members is 250/26 = 9.61 years.
The youngest member is 7 years old.
The oldest member is 7 + 3(26 - 1) = 80 years old.
