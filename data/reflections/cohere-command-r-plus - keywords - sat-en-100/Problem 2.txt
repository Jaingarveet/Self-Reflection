Solution: The authors of Passage 1 believe that women are naturally suited to roles that are gentle and domestic, such as motherhood and homemaking. They emphasize women's "delicate constitutions" and "peaceful inclinations," suggesting that these innate qualities make women unsuited for strenuous or onerous tasks. While they do mention a "division of powers," this is in the context of maintaining harmony and respecting the distinct functions of the sexes, not equating homemaking with running a country or business.
