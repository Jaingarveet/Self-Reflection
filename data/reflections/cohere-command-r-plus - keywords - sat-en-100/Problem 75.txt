Solution: The passage initially introduces the restaurant and its decor, including artwork and ferns. It then shifts to Lymie, describing his actions, thoughts, and reading material. The focus then expands to include other patrons, such as Irma, the waitress, and a party of four. The description of Mr. Peters, Lymie's father, is also from the narrator's perspective, noting his physical changes and actions. Thus, the primary focus shifts from Lymie's experience with his book to descriptions of other people in the restaurant, observed by Lymie and the narrator.
