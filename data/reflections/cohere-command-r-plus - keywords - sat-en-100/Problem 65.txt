Solution: The last paragraph describes Mr. Peters' awareness of his physical aging and his attempts to maintain a youthful image. It mentions his graying hair, weight loss, and attempts to use symbols of wealth and status, such as a diamond ring and manicured hands, to distract from his aging. However, the correct interpretation is that he behaves as if he were a younger version of himself, as indicated by the phrase "making him do things that were not becoming in a man of forty-five."
