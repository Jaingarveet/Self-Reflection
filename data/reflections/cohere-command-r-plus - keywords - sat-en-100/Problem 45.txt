Solution: The passage discusses an experiment by Hartmann, where one agricultural strip was plowed during the day and another at night, with no crops planted to avoid competition with weeds. The key sentence states, "No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds." This sentence indicates that the absence of crops was intended to isolate the effect of plowing time on weed growth, suggesting that the presence of crops could influence weed coverage.
