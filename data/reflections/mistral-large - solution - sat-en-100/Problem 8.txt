Solution:
To solve the problem again, I will follow these steps:

1. Read the question carefully and identify the task: to find the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder.
2. Look at the table and find the column for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
3. Scan the answer choices and identify the pathogens listed: IAPV, KBV, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
4. Look at the table again and find the row for each pathogen listed in the answer choices.
5. Compare the percentages for each pathogen and identify the highest percentage.
6. Choose the answer that corresponds to the pathogen with the highest percentage.
