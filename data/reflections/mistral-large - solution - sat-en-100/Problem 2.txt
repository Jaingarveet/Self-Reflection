The authors of Passage 1 believe that women should not aspire to exercise political rights and functions because their delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and duties of motherhood set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties and summon them to gentle occupations and cares of the home.

It can be inferred from this statement that the authors believe running a household and raising children entail activities that are gentle and not strenuous or onerous.
