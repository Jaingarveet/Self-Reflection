Solution:
To solve the problem again, I will first carefully read the question and the choices provided. The question asks for the pair of base percentages in sea urchin DN[REDACTED] that provides evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, which was about base pairing in DN[REDACTED]. The choices provided are pairs of percentages, not the actual bases themselves.

Looking at the table, I can see that the percentage of guanine in sea urchin DN[REDACTED] is 17.7%, and the percentage of cytosine is 17.3%. These percentages match the percentages in choice [REDACTED].
