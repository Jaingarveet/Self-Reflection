Solution:
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were true that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud. This would suggest that the musical quality of Jazz is not unique and that other novels can also be considered musical in nature. This would undermine the author's claim that Morrison's use of jazz as a structuring principle in Jazz is a unique achievement in North American literature.
