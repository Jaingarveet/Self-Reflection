Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider all possible arrangements of the islands. 
I assumed that G must be at the top of the line, but it could also be second from the top. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Limited thinking
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
If G is the northernmost island, it could be either at the top of the line or second from the top. 
Case 1: G is at the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From ([REDACTED]), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From ([REDACTED]), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the only possible arrangement is G-F-H-E-I.
Case [REDACTED]: G is second from the top of the line
From (1), F is adjacent to H and is on the north side of H, so F and H must be in the south of the line.
From ([REDACTED]), G is somewhere in the north of F, so G must be adjacent to F and in the north of F.
From ([REDACTED]), I and E are adjacent, so they must be in the middle of the line.
Therefore, the possible arrangement is F-G-H-E-I.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
[REDACTED]. Consider all possible arrangements of the given conditions.
[REDACTED]. Think through each subproblem step-by-step.
[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
