Explanation:
I chose option [REDACTED], which states that the northern salamander in Xinjiang hides under rocks in the creek during the day, avoiding trampling by cattle and sheep. However, this option does not contradict the experts' opinion that the trampling of cattle and sheep is the cause of the decline in the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang. 
Option [REDACTED], on the other hand, suggests that the decrease in rainfall and groundwater levels has affected the water source environment in which the northern salamander in Xinjiang lives. This option contradicts the experts' opinion that trampling by cattle and sheep is the primary cause of the decline in the number of northern salamanders in Xinjiang.
