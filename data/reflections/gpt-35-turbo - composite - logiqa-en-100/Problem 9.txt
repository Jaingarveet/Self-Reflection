Solution:
Printing group: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], M
Binding group: [REDACTED], [REDACTED], J
K cannot be in the same group as [REDACTED].
If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
At least one of the same employees in both groups.
If K replaces [REDACTED] in the printing group, then the printing group will be composed of [REDACTED], K, [REDACTED], and M. [REDACTED]owever, this violates the condition that if K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Therefore, K cannot replace [REDACTED] in the printing group. 
If K replaces [REDACTED] in the binding group, then the binding group will be composed of [REDACTED], J, and K. This satisfies all the given conditions. The printing group will be composed of [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and M, which also satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, K can replace [REDACTED] without violating any of the given conditions.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand all the given conditions.
2. Consider all the given conditions when analyzing the problem.
3. Identify the members of the printing group and the binding group.
4. Determine which member of the two groups can be replaced by K without violating any of the given conditions.
5. Double-check your analysis to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your analysis.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand all the given conditions.
 - Always consider all the given conditions when analyzing the problem.
 - Never overlook any of the given conditions.
 - Always double-check your analysis to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that each condition is important and must be considered in the analysis.
