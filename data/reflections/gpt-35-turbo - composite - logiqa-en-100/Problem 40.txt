Explanation:
My answer is incorrect because I did not consider all the possibilities mentioned in the authoritative person's statement. The statement mentions that having real knowledge, basic social skills, and accurate positioning can prevent someone from becoming a "sea waiter." However, it does not necessarily mean that having these qualities guarantees a job. Datian's situation is not clear enough to make a conclusion about his possession of these qualities. Therefore, conclusion [REDACTED] is not necessarily true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Overgeneralization
 - Misinterpretation
 - Insufficient information
