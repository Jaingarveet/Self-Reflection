Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the requirements. 
I only considered the requirement that [REDACTED] cannot be selected with [REDACTED]. 
However, there is another requirement that Guo Yanran and [REDACTED] cannot be selected at the same time. 
Therefore, if He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. 
Since [REDACTED] cannot be selected, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of requirements
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Ignoring a requirement
Solution:
If He Zhilian is not selected, then the group will consist of Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran, and three boys. 
From the requirements, we know that [REDACTED] cannot be selected with Guo Yanran or [REDACTED]. 
Also, Guo Yanran and [REDACTED] cannot be selected at the same time. 
Therefore, the only person who cannot be selected is [REDACTED].
