Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and chose the option that contradicts the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by natural disasters. However, the question asks which option cannot be used to question the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification caused by climate drought. Option [REDACTED] provides evidence of grassland degradation, which supports the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation and desertification. Option [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] provide evidence that grasslands in other areas are not degraded, which can be used to question the opinion. Option [REDACTED] suggests that human factors are the main cause of the increase in dust storms, which can be used to question the opinion.
