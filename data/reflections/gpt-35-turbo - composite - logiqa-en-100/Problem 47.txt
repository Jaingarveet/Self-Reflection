Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the logic of the statements. 
I assumed that a company with dividends cannot issue new stocks, but the statement says that only companies with dividends can issue new stocks. 
Therefore, if a company does not have dividends, it cannot issue new stocks. 
Error Keywords:

Solution:
- If a company has dividends, it cannot issue new stocks.
- If a company needs financing, it cannot pay dividends.
- [REDACTED] listed company can only issue new stocks if it has dividends.
- Therefore, a listed company that is not a company with dividends needs financing.
- Statement [REDACTED] cannot be false because a listed company must either not need financing or not be a company with dividends to issue new stocks.
