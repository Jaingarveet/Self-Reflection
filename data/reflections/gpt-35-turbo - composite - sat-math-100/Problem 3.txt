Explanation:
I made a calculation error when multiplying the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$ by $\frac{4}{3}$. 
The correct answer is obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$, which is $\frac{5}{3}$. 
This gives us $w=\frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3}=\frac{20}{9}$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Reciprocal error
Solution:
To solve for $w$, we need to isolate $w$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{5}$.
\begin{align*}
\frac{3}{5} w &= \frac{4}{3} \\
w &= \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} \\
w &= \frac{20}{9}
\end{align*}
