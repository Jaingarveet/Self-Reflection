Explanation:
I made an error in my algebraic manipulation. 
I incorrectly solved for $x$ by dividing both sides by $0.02$ instead of subtracting $0.18y$ from both sides. 
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Division error
 - Equation solving error
Solution:
Let's solve for $x$ in the given equation.
$$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$
$$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18x+0.18y$$
$$0.02 x=0.02 y$$
$$x=y$$
This means that the amount of $10 \%$ by mass saline solution used is equal to the amount of $20 \%$ by mass saline solution used.
If Clayton uses [REDACTED] milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, then he must use $x$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
We know that the total volume of the saline solution is $x+y=[REDACTED]+x$ milliliters.
We also know that the mass of the saline solution is $0.18(x+y)=0.18([REDACTED]+x)$ grams.
The mass of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution is $0.20([REDACTED])=20$ grams.
The mass of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution is $0.10x$ grams.
The total mass of the saline solution is $20+0.10x$ grams.
We can set up an equation to solve for $x$:
$$0.18([REDACTED]+x)=20+0.10x$$
$$18+0.18x=20+0.10x$$
$$0.08x=2$$
$$x=2[REDACTED]$$
Therefore, Clayton must use 2[REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
