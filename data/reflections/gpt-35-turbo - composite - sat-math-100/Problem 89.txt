Explanation:
I made a calculation error while dividing the product of the area of one ounce of graphene and 48 by the area of one football field. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in math but in the conversion of units. 
I knew the correct formula but made a mistake in the unit conversion.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Unit conversion error
 - Division error
Solution:
One ounce of graphene can cover 7 football fields.
One football field has an area of approximately $1 \frac{1}{3}$ acres.
To find the area covered by 48 ounces of graphene, we need to multiply the area of one ounce by 48 and then divide by the area of one football field.
Area of one ounce of graphene = $7 \times 1 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{28}{3}$ acres
Area covered by 48 ounces of graphene = $\frac{28}{3} \times 48 \div 7 \approx 192$ acres
