I should have distributed the negative sign to each term inside the parentheses. 
Error Keywords:
 - Distribution error
 - Sign error
 - Simplification error
Solution:
$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$
$$=x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}+x^{2} y-3 x y^{2}+3 y^{2}$$
$$=2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}$$
Instructions:
1. Distribute the negative sign to each term inside the second set of parentheses.
2. Combine like terms.
3. Simplify the expression.
4. Choose the answer that matches your simplified expression.
Advice:
