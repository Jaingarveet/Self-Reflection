Explanation:
I correctly solved for $x$ but made an error in the multiplication of $x$ by $3$. 
$3x$ is not equal to $3 \times x$.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
$20-x=1[REDACTED]$ can be solved for $x$ by subtracting $20$ from both sides.
$20-20-x=1[REDACTED]-20$
$-x=-[REDACTED]$
$x=[REDACTED]$
$3x=3 \times [REDACTED] = 1[REDACTED]$
Instructions:
1. Identify the equation to be solved.
2. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
3. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
4. Solve for the variable.
[REDACTED]. Multiply the value of the variable by the given coefficient.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of a number and a variable is the result of multiplying them together.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
