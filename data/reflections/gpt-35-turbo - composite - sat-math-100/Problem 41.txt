Explanation:
I used the Factor Theorem correctly but made an error in my calculations. 
I checked which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$ but made a mistake in the calculation for choice [REDACTED]. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
We can use the Factor Theorem to determine which of the choices is a factor of $f(x)$.
If $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(a)=0$.
We can check which of the choices makes $f(a)=0$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(2)=1$, so [REDACTED] is not a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(3)$ is not given, so we cannot determine if [REDACTED] is a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(4)=0$, so [REDACTED] is a factor of $f(x)$.
For choice [REDACTED], $f(5)=-2$, so [REDACTED] is not a factor of $f(x)$.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } x-4}$.
Instructions:
1. Understand the Factor Theorem and how it applies to polynomial functions.
2. Identify the given values of $x$ and $f(x)$ in the table.
3. For each choice, substitute the given value of $x$ into the expression $x-a$.
4. Evaluate $f(a)$ using the given value of $a$.
5. If $f(a)=0$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
6. Choose the answer that makes $f(a)=0$.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the given information to your advantage.
 - Always check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the Factor Theorem can help you determine factors of polynomial functions.
