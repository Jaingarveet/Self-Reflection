Explanation:
I solved for $x$ correctly, but I made an error in finding $\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}$. 
I incorrectly calculated $\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}$ as [REDACTED] instead of [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Division error
 - Misinterpretation of the question
Solution:
\begin{align*}
\frac{[REDACTED]}{x}&=\frac{1[REDACTED]}{x+[REDACTED]0}\\
[REDACTED](x+[REDACTED]0)&=1[REDACTED]x\\
[REDACTED]x+[REDACTED]0&=1[REDACTED]x\\
[REDACTED]x&=[REDACTED]0\\
x&=[REDACTED]\\
\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}&=\frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}\\
\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}&=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }[REDACTED]}
\end{align*}
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
[REDACTED]. Cross-multiply to solve for $x$.
3. Substitute the value of $x$ to find $\frac{x}{[REDACTED]}$.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
[REDACTED]. Answer the question in the correct format.
