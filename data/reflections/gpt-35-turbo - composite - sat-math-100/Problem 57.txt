Explanation:
The correct approach is to find the probability of the event that the winner will be either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older. We can find this probability by adding the probability of the event that the winner will be a female under age 40 to the probability of the event that the winner will be a male age 40 or older. 
The probability of the event that the winner will be a female under age 40 is $\frac{8}{25}$, which is the number of females under age 40 divided by the total number of people.
The probability of the event that the winner will be a male age 40 or older is $\frac{5}{25}$, which is the number of males age 40 or older divided by the total number of people.
Adding these probabilities, we get $\frac{8}{25}+\frac{5}{25}=\frac{13}{25}$.
Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{10}{25}}$.

Solution:
The problem requires us to find the probability of the event that the winner will be either a female under age 40 or a male age 40 or older. We can find this probability by adding the probability of the event that the winner will be a female under age 40 to the probability of the event that the winner will be a male age 40 or older. 
The probability of the event that the winner will be a female under age 40 is $\frac{8}{25}$, which is the number of females under age 40 divided by the total number of people.
The probability of the event that the winner will be a male age 40 or older is $\frac{5}{25}$, which is the number of males age 40 or older divided by the total number of people.
Adding these probabilities, we get $\frac{8}{25}+\frac{5}{25}=\frac{13}{25}$.
Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{10}{25}}$.
