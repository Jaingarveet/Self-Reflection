Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the value of $f([REDACTED])$.
The correct calculation is $f([REDACTED])=\frac{[REDACTED]+3}{[REDACTED]}=[REDACTED]$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Substitution error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The function $f(x)$ is defined as $f(x)=\frac{x+3}{[REDACTED]}$.
To find $f([REDACTED])$, substitute $[REDACTED]$ for $x$ in the function $f(x)$.
$f([REDACTED])=\frac{[REDACTED]+3}{[REDACTED]}=[REDACTED]$.
Instructions:
[REDACTED]. Identify the function and the value of $x$.
[REDACTED]. Substitute the value of $x$ into the function.
3. Simplify the expression by performing the arithmetic operations.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always substitute the given value of $x$ into the function.
 - Always simplify the expression by performing the arithmetic operations.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
