Explanation:
I correctly translated the problem into an equation, but I made a mistake in solving for $x$. 
The correct solution is $x=[REDACTED]$, but I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is $8x=1[REDACTED]$. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which is $8x=1[REDACTED]$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Substitution error
Solution:
The problem can be translated into an equation: $1[REDACTED]+4x=14+10$. 
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get $1[REDACTED]+4x=[REDACTED]4$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x=[REDACTED]$.
To find the value of $8x$, we substitute $x=[REDACTED]$ into $8x$.
$8x=8([REDACTED])=1[REDACTED]$.
