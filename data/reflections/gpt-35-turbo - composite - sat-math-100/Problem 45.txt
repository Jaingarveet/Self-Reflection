Explanation:
I correctly identified that the function is linear and used the slope-intercept form, but I made an error in calculating the y-intercept. 
The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is not given in the table. 
Therefore, I should have used the given data to find the slope and then used the slope and any point in the table to find the y-intercept. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Slope-intercept form error
 - Y-intercept error
Solution:
The slope is the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight, which is $\frac{\$ 21.89-\$ 16.94}{10-5}=\$ 0.99$.
Using the point $(5, \$ 16.94)$, we can find the y-intercept as follows:
$16.94=0.99(5)+b$
$b=11.99$
Therefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.
Instructions:
1. Identify the given data in the problem.
2. Determine the type of function that relates the given data.
3. Use the slope-intercept form to write the function.
4. Identify the slope of the function using the given data.
5. Use any point in the table to find the y-intercept.
6. Write the final function.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept of a linear function.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the slope of a linear function is the change in y divided by the change in x.
 - Remember that the y-intercept of a linear function is the y-value when x is 0.
