Explanation:
I correctly identified that the equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
However, I made an error in substituting $x=[REDACTED]$ and $y=[REDACTED]$ in the equation of the line.
When $x=[REDACTED]$ and $y=[REDACTED]$, the equation becomes $-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$.
Simplifying this equation gives $k^2-[REDACTED]k+[REDACTED]=[REDACTED]$.
Factoring this equation gives $(k-[REDACTED])(k-[REDACTED])=[REDACTED]$, so $k=[REDACTED]$ is a repeated root.
However, the question asks for which of the following could be the value of $k$, so we need to check the other answer choices.
Substituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives a line with a slope of $\frac{32}{-2}=-[REDACTED]$, which does not pass through the origin.
Substituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives a line with a slope of $\frac{2[REDACTED]}{6}=[REDACTED]$, which does pass through the origin.
Substituting $k=[REDACTED]$ gives a line with a slope of $\frac{[REDACTED]}{-1[REDACTED]}$, which does not pass through the origin.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }[REDACTED]}$.
