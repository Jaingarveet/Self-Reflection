Explanation:
I made an error in calculating the total cost of the television. 
The correct equation is $300=30w+60$ because the initial payment of $\$ 60$ must be added to the total cost of the television. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
Solution:
The initial payment is $\$ 60$.
The weekly payment is $\$ 30$.
Let $w$ be the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.
The total cost of the television is $\$ 300$.
The correct equation is $300=30w+60$ because the initial payment of $\$ 60$ must be added to the total cost of the television. 
To solve for $w$, we can start by subtracting $60$ from both sides of the equation:
\begin{align*}
300 &= 30w + 60 \\
240 &= 30w \\
8 &= w
\end{align*}
Therefore, it will take 8 weekly payments of $\$ 30$ to complete the purchase of the television.
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial payment and weekly payment amounts.
2. Identify the total cost of the television.
3. Write an equation that relates the total cost of the television to the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase.
4. Solve the equation for the unknown variable.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the unknown variable and write an equation that relates it to the given information.
 - Always double-check your algebraic manipulations and final answer.
 - Remember to add or subtract any initial payments or fees to the total cost of the item.
