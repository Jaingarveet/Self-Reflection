Explanation:
My algebraic setup was correct, but I made a mistake in solving the equations.
The correct setup of equations is:
3x + 5 = n
4x + [REDACTED] = n
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
x + [REDACTED] = 0
x = -[REDACTED]
Since the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.
The correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.
n = 3x + 5
n = 4x + [REDACTED]
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
3x + 5 = 4x + [REDACTED]
x = [REDACTED]
Therefore, there are [REDACTED] students in the class.

Solution:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem.
Let's assume there are 'x' students in the class.
If each student gets 3 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 3x milliliters.
If Mr. Kohl has 5 milliliters left over, then the total amount of solution he has is 3x + 5 milliliters.
If each student gets 4 milliliters of solution, then the total amount of solution required is 4x milliliters.
If Mr. Kohl needs an additional [REDACTED] milliliters, then the total amount of solution he needs is 4x + [REDACTED] milliliters.
We can set up two equations using the above information and solve for 'x'.
3x + 5 = n
4x + [REDACTED] = n
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
x + [REDACTED] = 0
x = -[REDACTED]
Since the number of students cannot be negative, this answer is not valid.
The correct answer can be found by solving for 'n' using either of the two equations and then dividing by the amount of solution each student gets.
n = 3x + 5
n = 4x + [REDACTED]
Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
3x + 5 = 4x + [REDACTED]
x = [REDACTED]
Therefore, there are [REDACTED] students in the class.
