Explanation:
I correctly found that $b=-4x+7$ and $c=-2y+7$. However, I made an error in substituting these values into the equations. I substituted $b$ and $c$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ incorrectly. 
Error Keywords:
 - Substitution error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Calculation error
Solution:
$b=c-\frac{1}{2}$
$b=-4x+7$
$c=-2y+7$
$c-\frac{1}{2}=-4x+7$
$c=-4x+\frac{15}{2}$
$3x+b=5x-7$
$3x+(-4x+7)=5x-7$
$3x-4x+7=5x-7$
$x=-7$
$3y+c=5y-7$
$3y+(-2y+7)=5y-7$
$3y-2y+7=5y-7$
$y=7$
$x-y=-14$
Instructions:
1. Identify the constants $b$ and $c$.
2. Use the given equations to solve for $b$ and $c$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.
3. Substitute $b$ and $c$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ into the given equations.
4. Simplify the resulting equations.
5. Solve for $x$ and $y$.
6. Calculate $x-y$.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always double-check your algebraic manipulations.
 - Always substitute variables correctly.
 - Always simplify equations before solving for variables.
 - Always check your final answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.
