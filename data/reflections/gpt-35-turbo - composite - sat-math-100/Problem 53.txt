Explanation:
I used the equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ correctly. However, I made a calculation error while substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line. 
The point [REDACTED] does not lie on the line $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Substitution error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
Solution:
The equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $\frac{1}{7}$ is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
Let's check which point lies on this line by substituting the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=0$, which is not true.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=\frac{1}{7}$, which is not true.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=1$, which is not true.
For point [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], $y=\frac{1}{7}x=2$, which is true.
Therefore, the point [REDACTED] lies on the line $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
Instructions:
1. Write down the equation of the line passing through the origin with slope $m$.
2. Substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ in the equation of the line for each point.
3. Simplify the equation and check if it is true.
4. Choose the point that satisfies the equation of the line.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula or equation to solve the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that substitution is a powerful tool to check if a point lies on a line or curve.
