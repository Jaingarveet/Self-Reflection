Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by choosing option C, Laminin 5, as the antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid. The correct answer is A, XVII collagen. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in pathology but in the specific antigens involved in Cicatricial pemphigoid. 
I knew the general concept of Cicatricial pemphigoid and salt split skin technique but did not know the specific antigen involved.

 - Specific antigen error
 - Misinterpretation error
Solution:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes.
Salt split skin technique is used to differentiate between epidermal and dermal binding of autoantibodies.
In Cicatricial pemphigoid, IgG binds to the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique.
The antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid is XVII collagen.
Instructions:
1. Understand the concept of Cicatricial pemphigoid and salt split skin technique.
2. Identify the antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid.
3. Read each option carefully and understand the specific antigen involved.
4. Choose the option that matches the antigen bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt split skin technique in Cicatricial pemphigoid.
5. Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always review the specific antigens involved in each disease.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the salt split skin technique is used to differentiate between epidermal and dermal binding of autoantibodies.
