Explanation:
I incorrectly answered this question because I did not remember the upper limit of normal for CA 125. 
The upper limit of normal for CA 125 varies depending on the laboratory and the menopausal status of the patient. 
In premenopausal women, the upper limit of normal is usually 35 U/ml. 
In postmenopausal women, the upper limit of normal is usually 25 U/ml.

Solution:
The upper limit of normal for CA 125 varies depending on the laboratory and the menopausal status of the patient. 
In premenopausal women, the upper limit of normal is usually 35 U/ml. 
In postmenopausal women, the upper limit of normal is usually 25 U/ml. 
Instructions:
1. Identify the menopausal status of the patient.
2. Check the laboratory reference range for the upper limit of normal for CA 125.
3. If the patient is premenopausal, the upper limit of normal is usually 35 U/ml.
4. If the patient is postmenopausal, the upper limit of normal is usually 25 U/ml.
5. Choose the answer that matches the upper limit of normal for the patient's menopausal status and laboratory reference range.
Advice:
 - Always remember that laboratory reference ranges may vary.
 - Always consider the patient's clinical context when interpreting laboratory results.
 - Always double-check your knowledge of laboratory reference ranges.
 - Always be aware of the limitations of tumor markers in clinical practice.
