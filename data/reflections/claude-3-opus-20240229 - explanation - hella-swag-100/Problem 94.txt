Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the next logical step after racking the balls would be for the player to break them to start a new game. However, upon re-reading the question and choices more carefully, I realize that none of the choices actually describe a typical break shot. Instead, the correct answer describes the player striking the cue ball but then immediately stopping it, which doesn't make sense in the context of normal gameplay. I was too quick to make an assumption based on my general knowledge of pool without carefully considering the specific information provided.
