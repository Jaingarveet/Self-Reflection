Explanation:
I focused too much on the initial description of the scene and didn't consider how the scene could evolve. I assumed the man would continue flying kites and the crowd would remain watching, but I failed to anticipate a change in the situation, like the man finishing the kite-flying demonstration and a woman beginning to speak to the crowd.
