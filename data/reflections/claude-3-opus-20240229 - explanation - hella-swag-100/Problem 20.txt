Explanation:
I chose the answer that seemed most mundane and ordinary, rather than considering the dramatic and eye-catching possibilities. While birds walking on the beach are common, the phrasing "a bird appears to divebomb into the ocean" suggests a surprising and notable visual that would fit well in an action-oriented surfing video. I was thinking too literally and not imaginatively enough about what would make for compelling video content.
