Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on finding a direct continuation of the cooking action described in the introduction. While [REDACTED] seemed to continue the cooking theme, it introduced new elements (pasta, eggs) that didn't logically follow from seasoning a pan. I didn't properly consider [REDACTED], which zooms out to frame the introduction as part of a cooking video series, the most logical completion in retrospect.
