Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the placement of the books.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf to mean that the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
I also overlooked the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
