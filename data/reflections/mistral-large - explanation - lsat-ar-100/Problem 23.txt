Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
I assumed that this condition applied only to the day after Nina's report, but it actually applies to any day after Nina's report.
