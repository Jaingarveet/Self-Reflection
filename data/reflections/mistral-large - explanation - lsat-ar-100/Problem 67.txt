Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the maximum number of batches that can be made per day.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the legal domain but in the interpretation of the given conditions.
I misinterpreted the condition "No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day" as "At most two batches of cookies can be made on the same day."

 - Incorrect assumption
