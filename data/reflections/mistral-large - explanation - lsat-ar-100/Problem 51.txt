Explanation:
I made an error in my interpretation of the conditions given in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the conditions and applying them correctly.
I misinterpreted the condition that "The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day."
I incorrectly assumed that this condition meant that Yuki and Seamus must test the same bicycle on both days.
However, the condition only applies to the second day, not the first day.
