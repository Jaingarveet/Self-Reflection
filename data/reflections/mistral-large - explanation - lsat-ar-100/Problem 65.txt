Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the selection of botanists.
The gap in my knowledge was not understanding that more than one botanist could be selected if only one zoologist is selected, as long as there is at least one scientist of each type.
I also overlooked the fact that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which means that all three zoologists must be selected.
