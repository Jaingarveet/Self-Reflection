Explanation:
I misinterpreted the requirements for the selection of works.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the constraints of the problem.
I incorrectly assumed that if the organizer selected only one French novel, then at least one French play must be selected.
However, the organizer can select [REDACTED] to meet the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels.
