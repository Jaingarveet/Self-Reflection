Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I assumed that since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Tuesday. However, this is not necessarily true.
