Explanation:
I made an error in evaluating the conditions given in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my understanding of the conditions and my evaluation of the choices.
I incorrectly evaluated choice [REDACTED] as violating condition 3, but it actually satisfies all conditions.
