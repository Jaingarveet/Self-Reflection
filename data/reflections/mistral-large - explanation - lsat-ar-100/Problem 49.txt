Explanation:
I made an error in my evaluation of choice [REDACTED] and did not consider choice [REDACTED] carefully enough.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the constraints but in applying them correctly to each choice.
I incorrectly assumed that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants had to be at opposite ends of the row, but the constraint only specifies that they cannot be in the same space.
I also failed to consider that the two restaurants could be separated by more than two businesses, not just exactly two.
