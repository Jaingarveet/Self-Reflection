Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misunderstood the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
I assumed that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, but this is not necessarily true.
