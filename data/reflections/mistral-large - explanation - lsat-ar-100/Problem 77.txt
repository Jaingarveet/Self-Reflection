Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the rules and the limitations they imposed on the employees.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my logical reasoning and analysis.
I did not consider all the rules and their implications fully.
I stopped my analysis too early, not realizing that further limitations could be inferred.
