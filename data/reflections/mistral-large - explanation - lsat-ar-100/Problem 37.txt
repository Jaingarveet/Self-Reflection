Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the position of T in the performance order.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the conditions but in interpreting the position of T.
I assumed that T must be performed immediately before F or immediately after R, but the condition only states that T can be performed in either position, not that it must be.
