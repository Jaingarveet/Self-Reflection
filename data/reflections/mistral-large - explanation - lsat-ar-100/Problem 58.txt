Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the position of the bay holding [REDACTED].
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the condition that the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED].
I assumed that it meant that the bay holding [REDACTED] must be immediately next to the bay holding [REDACTED].
However, the condition only states that the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], not that it must be immediately next to it.
