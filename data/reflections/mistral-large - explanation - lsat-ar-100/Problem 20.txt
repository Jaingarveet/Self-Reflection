Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions for Nina's report.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the conditions for Nina's report.
I assumed that if Nina gave a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, but this is only true if Nina's report is not given on Wednesday.
I also made an incorrect assumption about Olivia and Robert not being able to give morning reports.
The conditions only state that they cannot give afternoon reports.
