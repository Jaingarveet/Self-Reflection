Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the selection criteria and overlooked a crucial detail in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the subject matter but in my understanding of the problem.
I misunderstood the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
I also overlooked the fact that [REDACTED] cannot be selected because it would require both [REDACTED] and R to be selected, which is not possible since Q is already selected.

Error [REDACTED]eywords:
 - [REDACTED]isunderstanding of selection criteria
 - Overlooking crucial details
 - [REDACTED]isinterpretation of conditional statements
