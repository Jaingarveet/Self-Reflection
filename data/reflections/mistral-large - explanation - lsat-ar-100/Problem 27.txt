Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
The gap in my knowledge was in interpreting the condition correctly.
I misunderstood that the condition meant that only two students could review the same play, not that two students could review the same set of plays.
