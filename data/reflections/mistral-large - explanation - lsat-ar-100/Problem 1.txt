Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misinterpreted the conditions given in the problem. I mistakenly thought that exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday and no other day, but the conditions only state that exactly two witnesses must testify on Tuesday, not that no other witnesses can testify on other days.
