Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions for Helen and Irving giving reports.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in understanding the conditions of the problem.
I misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
