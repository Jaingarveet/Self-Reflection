Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the placement of the pharmacy.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the legal constraints but in my interpretation of them.
I misinterpreted the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
I assumed that the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist, but it could also be next to the veterinarian.
