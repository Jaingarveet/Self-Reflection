Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the constraint that "Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day" to mean that they must lead both morning and afternoon sessions on the same day.

 - Incorrect assumption
