Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misinterpreted the constraint that "[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must lead sessions that meet on the same day" to mean that they must lead sessions on the same day of the week, rather than the same day of the lab schedule.
I also overlooked the constraint that "[REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s."
