Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning by not considering all the conditions given in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I correctly identified that J must be earlier than G, but I failed to consider that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
I also failed to consider that S must be earlier than Y.
