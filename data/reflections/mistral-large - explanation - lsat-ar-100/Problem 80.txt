Explanation:
I made an error in my evaluation of the options.
I incorrectly stated that Xu is assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Souza in option [REDACTED], but in fact, Xu is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza in option [REDACTED].
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my evaluation of the options.
I knew the correct rules but made an evaluation error.
