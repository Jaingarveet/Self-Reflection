Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the order of the reports.
I assumed that since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the morning reports, they cannot give an afternoon report. However, the question does not specify that each student can only give one report.
I also made an incorrect assumption about the order of the reports based on Nina's report. I assumed that since Nina gives an afternoon report, she cannot give a report on Wednesday. However, the question states that Nina cannot give an afternoon report on Wednesday, not that she cannot give a report at all on Wednesday.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in reading comprehension and logical reasoning.
I did not carefully read and interpret the conditions of the problem.
I made assumptions that were not supported by the information given.
I did not consider all possible scenarios.
