Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the distribution of sales representatives in the zones.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in logical reasoning.
I incorrectly assumed that Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives, but it could have more.
I also incorrectly assumed that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3 with Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall, but they could work in Zone 1.
