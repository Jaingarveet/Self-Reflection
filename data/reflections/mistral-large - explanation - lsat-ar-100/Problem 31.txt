Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the order in which the batches of cookies are made.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in the interpretation of the given conditions.
I assumed that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made after the first batch, but the conditions do not specify this.
