Explanation:
I misinterpreted the conditions and made an incorrect assumption about the relationship between website and voicemail targets.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the conditions and applying them correctly.
I incorrectly assumed that if one client had [REDACTED], the other clients could not have [REDACTED] because their voicemail targets would have to be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible.
However, the conditions do not state that a client's voicemail target must be shorter than all other clients' voicemail targets, only that it must be shorter than the same client's website target.
