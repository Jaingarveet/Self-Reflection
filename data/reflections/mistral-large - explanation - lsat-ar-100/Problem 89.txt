Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the number of batches made on Friday.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in the interpretation of the given conditions.
I misunderstood the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
I also overlooked the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
