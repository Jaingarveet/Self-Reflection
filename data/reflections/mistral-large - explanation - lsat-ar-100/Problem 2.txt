Explanation:
I misunderstood the original constraint and the effect of the answer choices.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the constraints and their implications.
I did not consider the possibility that the constraint could be rephrased in a way that still maintains the same effect.
I also did not fully consider the implications of each answer choice.
