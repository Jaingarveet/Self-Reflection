Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the question and did not carefully consider the given conditions.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I did not realize that the question asked for a possible scenario, not a definite one.
I also did not consider all the possible scenarios based on the given conditions.
