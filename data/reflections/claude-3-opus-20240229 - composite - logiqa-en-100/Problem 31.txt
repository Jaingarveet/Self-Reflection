Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted choice [REDACTED] as questioning the given opinion, when in fact it supports it. Choice [REDACTED] indicates that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia, which is consistent with the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation due to climate drought. My error was in misinterpreting the implications of the choice with respect to the given opinion.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of choice
 - Incorrect inference
 - Faulty reasoning
 - Misunderstanding of relationship between choice and opinion
Solution:
Let's re-evaluate each choice to determine if it allows the given opinion to be questioned:
[REDACTED]: The fact that grass in Xilin Gol grassland has significantly decreased in height over time supports the idea that grassland degradation has occurred, which is consistent with the opinion. This choice does not question the opinion.
[REDACTED]: The contrast between the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia and the thriving grasslands in Mongolia suggests that factors other than climate drought may be responsible for the degradation. This choice questions the opinion.
[REDACTED]: If the uninhabited border area maintains healthy grass, it implies that human activities, rather than climate drought, may be the primary cause of grassland degradation. This choice questions the opinion.
[REDACTED]: This choice directly states that human factors are the main causes of increased dust storms, questioning the opinion that they are inevitable natural disasters caused by climate drought.
Therefore, choices [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] allow the given opinion to be questioned, while choice [REDACTED] supports the opinion.
Instructions:
1. Read the given opinion carefully and identify its key points.
2. Analyze each choice individually to determine its relationship to the opinion.
3. Consider whether each choice supports, questions, or is neutral to the opinion.
4. Identify the choice that does not allow the opinion to be questioned, i.e., the choice that supports the opinion.
5. Double-check your reasoning for each choice to ensure accuracy.
6. Select the choice that is the exception, i.e., the one that does not question the opinion.
Advice:
 - Always read the given opinion and choices carefully to understand their implications.
 - Consider the relationship between each choice and the opinion individually.
 - Look for choices that provide evidence or reasoning that contradicts the opinion.
 - Be cautious of choices that may initially seem to question the opinion but actually support it upon closer examination.
 - Double-check your reasoning for each choice to avoid misinterpretations.
