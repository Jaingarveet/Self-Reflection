Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the selected girls if He Zhilian is not selected. However, I then incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] could be selected since Guo Yanran was selected. I failed to consider that if [REDACTED] is selected, then both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot be selected due to the given conditions. This would leave only Ren Xiangyang and [REDACTED] as possible selections for the boys, which is not enough.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete consideration of constraints
 - Failure to consider all implications of a choice
Solution:
1. If He Zhilian is not selected, then Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the selected girls.
2. If Guo Yanran is selected, then [REDACTED] cannot be selected (condition 1).
3. So the three selected boys must be chosen from [REDACTED], [REDACTED], Ren Xiangyang, and [REDACTED].
4. [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot both be selected (condition 2).
5. [REDACTED] can be selected since [REDACTED] is not selected (condition 3 allows this).
6. Therefore, one valid selection for the boys is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and Ren Xiangyang.
7. [REDACTED] cannot be selected in any case if He Zhilian is not selected.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all the given conditions and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed selections based on the question (e.g., He Zhilian not being selected).
3. Consider the implications of each fixed selection on the remaining choices, based on the given conditions.
4. Methodically consider each remaining choice and check if it violates any conditions, either directly or indirectly.
5. Eliminate choices that lead to violations of the conditions.
6. Identify the choice(s) that cannot be selected under any valid scenario.
Advice:
 - Always consider the implications of each choice in light of all given conditions.
 - Be thorough in considering both the direct and indirect consequences of each selection.
 - Eliminate options systematically based on logical deductions from the conditions.
 - If a choice leads to a scenario that violates a condition, that choice cannot be part of the solution.
 - In complex scenarios, it may help to enumerate all possible valid selections to identify the impossible ones.
