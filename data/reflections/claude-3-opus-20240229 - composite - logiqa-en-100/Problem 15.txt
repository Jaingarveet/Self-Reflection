Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. However, the first premise states that the microorganism "usually" breeds above freezing, not "always". This leaves open the possibility, even if unlikely, that the microorganism could still reproduce in freezing temperatures. The conclusion is highly likely to be true based on the premises, but there is a small chance it could be false.
Error Keywords:
 - Overconfidence in conclusion 
 - Ignoring qualifying language
 - Assuming absolute statements
 - Not considering exceptions or unlikely possibilities
Solution:
1. The first premise states the microorganism usually breeds above freezing temperatures. The word "usually" suggests this is not an absolute rule.
2. The second premise states it is currently winter and the lake is frozen, so the temperature is below freezing.
3. The conclusion states that if the microorganism is present, it will not reproduce now due to the freezing temperatures. 
4. While the conclusion is highly likely to be true based on the premises, the use of "usually" in the first premise allows for the small possibility the conclusion could be false if this microorganism is capable of reproducing below freezing, even if it does not typically do so.
5. Therefore, the best answer is that the conclusion is highly likely to be true, but may also be false.
Instructions:
1. Read the premises carefully, noting any qualifying language like "usually", "sometimes", "often", etc.
2. Read the conclusion and determine if it follows from the premises.
3. Consider if the conclusion would still hold if the premises were not absolutes. Look for exception cases.
4. If there are any scenarios, even if unlikely, where the conclusion could be false despite the premises being true, then the conclusion is not an absolute.
5. Select the answer choice that best reflects the likelihood of the conclusion being true or false, allowing for exceptions.
Advice:
 - Don't assume premises are absolute statements unless clearly specified. Watch for qualifying language.
 - Always consider if there are exception cases or unlikely scenarios where a conclusion may not hold, even if premises are true.
 - [REDACTED] conclusion that is highly likely or almost certainly true based on the premises may still have a small chance of being false.
 - Absolute statements like "cannot be true" or "cannot be false" are only correct if there are truly no possible exceptions.
 - Read carefully and consider all possibilities before selecting an answer.
