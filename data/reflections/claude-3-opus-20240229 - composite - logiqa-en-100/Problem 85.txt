Explanation:
I failed to properly consider all the given conditions and their implications. Specifically, I did not fully think through the consequences of condition (3) in combination with the other conditions. This led me to incorrectly conclude that none of the choices must be true, when in fact choice [REDACTED] must be true based on the given information.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Failure to consider all conditions
 - Failure to combine implications of multiple conditions
 - Incorrect logical deduction
Solution:
Let's think through this again, considering all conditions carefully:
1. Paper E cannot be used (condition 4).
2. If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used but paper K must be used (condition 1). However, since paper E cannot be used, we can't conclude anything from this condition.
3. Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J (condition 2). This means that if either G or H is used, J cannot be used.
4. If paper G is not used, then paper K is not used (condition 3). The contrapositive of this statement is also true: if paper K is used, then paper G must be used.
5. Now, since either G or H must be used (because E cannot be used), and G and H cannot be used with J, we can conclude that J cannot be used.
6. Furthermore, if G is used, then K must also be used (contrapositive of condition 3).
7. Therefore, J cannot be used, but K must be used. This matches choice [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and list out all the given conditions.
2. Consider each condition one by one and think about its implications.
3. Look for connections between the conditions. See if the implication of one condition can be combined with another condition to draw a new conclusion.
4. Consider the contrapositive of each condition as well as the condition itself.
5. Systematically eliminate the choices that contradict the conditions or their implications.
6. If a choice matches the implications of the conditions, it must be true.
7. Double-check your reasoning to ensure you haven't missed anything.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and list out all the given information.
 - Consider the implications of each piece of information separately and in combination.
 - Remember that the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true.
 - Eliminate choices systematically based on the given conditions.
 - If a choice is a necessary consequence of the given conditions, then it must be true.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to avoid logical errors.
