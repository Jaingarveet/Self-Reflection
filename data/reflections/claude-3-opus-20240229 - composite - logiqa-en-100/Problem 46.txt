Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible department assignments. I correctly identified some of the constraints, but I did not fully consider the implications of condition (3) - if X is in sales, then W must be in production. This eliminates more possibilities than I initially realized.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete constraint analysis
 - Faulty deduction
 - Overlooked implications
 - Incorrect elimination of possibilities
Solution:
1. From condition (4), F must be in production.
2. From condition (2), since F is in production, G cannot be in production. So G must be in either sales or public relations.
3. From condition (1), H and Y must be in the same department.
4. From condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. 
   - This means that if X is in sales, H and Y cannot be in production (because W would be the 3rd person in production, leaving no room for H and Y).
   - It also means that if X is in sales, H and Y must be in public relations (because they can't be in production or sales).
5. So if X is in sales:
   - W must be in production
   - H and Y must be in public relations
   - F is in production
   - This leaves only I and G for the remaining 2 sales spots and 1 production spot.
6. Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together. If X is in sales, G must be in the remaining production spot.
7. Looking at the other choices:
   - [REDACTED] could be in sales together (if X is not in sales)
   - [REDACTED] cannot be in sales together (because H and Y must be together, and if they're in sales, G must be in PR)
   - [REDACTED] could be in sales together (if X is not in sales)
Therefore, the pair that cannot be in sales together is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note down all the given conditions.
2. Consider each condition one by one and think about its implications.
3. Use the process of elimination to rule out impossible scenarios based on the conditions.
4. Pay special attention to conditions that link the placement of two or more people.
5. Consider the implications of each condition not just in isolation, but in combination with the others.
6. Systematically go through each answer choice and check if it is possible or impossible based on the conditions.
7. Choose the answer choice that is impossible or least likely based on the given conditions.
Advice:
 - In problems with multiple conditions, consider the implications of each condition carefully.
 - Look out for conditions that link the placement of multiple entities - these often have far-reaching implications.
 - Use the process of elimination to systematically rule out impossible scenarios.
 - Don't just consider each condition in isolation - think about how they interact with each other.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions - stick to the information given in the question.
 - Double-check your reasoning for each answer choice before selecting your final answer.
