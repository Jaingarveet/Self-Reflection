Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on finding a direct reason why people who favor college student nannies wouldn't hire them. However, the correct answer provides an indirect explanation by revealing people's underlying motivations.
If people favor college students being nannies primarily because they think it's good for the students, not because they think the students will provide better service, that could explain why they wouldn't necessarily hire them personally.
My reasoning was too literal and I didn't consider the broader implications of the answer choices.
Error Keywords:
 - Narrow focus 
 - Literal interpretation
 - Missed implications
 - Incomplete reasoning
Solution:
The survey showed that 63% of respondents favored college students as nannies, but nearly 60% said they would not hire a college student as a nanny.
This seems contradictory on the surface. 
Choice [REDACTED] states that among those who favor college students as nannies, 69% think it's good for the students, while only 31% think the students would provide better service.
This suggests that people's reason for favoring student nannies is not based on expecting superior housekeeping. 
Instead, they seem to favor the idea because they believe the experience is valuable for the students.
However, when considering their own needs, this belief is not enough to persuade them to actually hire a student.
They may prefer to hire nannies with more experience or availability, even if they generally like the idea of students working as nannies for their own growth and development.
Therefore, choice [REDACTED] reveals an underlying motivation that explains the seemingly contradictory survey results.
Instructions:
1. Identify the apparent contradiction in the survey results.
2. Consider each answer choice carefully. Don't just look for a direct explanation, but think about the broader implications of each statement.
3. Look for an answer that reveals people's underlying motivations or beliefs that could explain the contradiction.
4. Reason through how that motivation would lead to favoring an idea in principle but not following it in personal practice.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant to explaining the contradiction.
6. Select the answer choice that best resolves the apparent contradiction by providing insight into people's reasoning.
Advice:
 - Don't just look for the most obvious or literal explanation. Consider indirect explanations that address underlying motivations.
 - Think through the implications of each answer choice. What does it reveal about how people think about the issue?
 - Look for the answer that best bridges the gap between people's stated beliefs and their actual choices.
 - Eliminate answers that don't address the contradiction or that provide irrelevant information.
 - Remember that people's reasoning is not always straightforward. Look for hidden factors that influence their opinions and decisions.
