Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the author's assertion in lines 11-16. The assertion is not just about African American writers using a musical genre as a structuring principle, but about any writer doing so. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that challenges this assertion in a broader context, not just within African American literature.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Contextual understanding error
- Specificity error
Solution:
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that no writer had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz. This assertion would be most called into question if it were true that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, depending on whether or not it is read aloud. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the author's assertion in the given lines.
2. Understand the context and scope of the assertion.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the author's assertion.
4. Choose the answer that most directly challenges the author's assertion.
5. Ensure that the chosen answer applies to the broad context of the assertion, not just a specific subset.
Advice:
- Always read the question and passage carefully to understand the context.
- Pay attention to the scope of the author's assertions.
- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the author's assertion, not just based on its individual merit.
- Be aware of the broader context, not just specific subsets.
