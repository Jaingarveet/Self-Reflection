Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Choice [REDACTED] was the correct answer because it seemed to directly support the professor's conclusion about Checkers's motive. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Choice [REDACTED] is actually restating the conclusion rather than providing an assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Restating conclusion
 - Failing to identify the gap between premises and conclusion
 - Misinterpreting answer choices
Solution:
The professor's argument can be broken down as follows:
Premise 1: Marty's Pizza sold coupon books for one large plain pizza, redeemable at any local pizza parlor.
Premise 2: Checkers Pizza refused to accept these coupons, even though all other local pizza parlors accepted them.
Premise 3: Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and satisfied its potential customers who purchased the coupon books.
Conclusion: Checkers's motive in refusing the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza.
To properly draw the conclusion, we need an assumption that connects the premises (Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons despite no cost and potential customer satisfaction) to the conclusion (Checkers's motive was to hurt Marty's).
Choice [REDACTED] provides this necessary assumption: If a company refuses to accept a competitor's coupons when doing so would satisfy potential customers and cost nothing, then the company's sole motivation must be to hurt the competitor. This assumption bridges the gap between the premises and the conclusion, enabling the conclusion to be properly drawn.
Instructions:
1. Identify the premises and conclusion of the argument.
2. Determine the gap between the premises and the conclusion.
3. Look for an answer choice that provides an assumption to bridge this gap.
4. Ensure the chosen answer is an assumption, not a restatement of the conclusion or premises.
5. Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, too broad, or unsupported by the given information.
Advice:
 - Always carefully identify the premises and conclusion of an argument.
 - Look for the gap between the premises and conclusion that needs to be bridged by an assumption.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that simply restate the conclusion or premises.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are out of scope, too broad, or unsupported by the given information.
 - The correct assumption should be a statement that, if true, enables the conclusion to be properly drawn from the premises.
