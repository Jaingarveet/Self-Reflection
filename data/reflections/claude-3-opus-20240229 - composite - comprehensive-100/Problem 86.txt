Explanation:
I chose the answer that seemed to provide the most logical next step in the process of creating a user account on OLX. However, I failed to recognize that the given text was not asking for the next step, but rather for the most likely completion of the last sentence about visiting the OLX website. My error was in not carefully reading and understanding the specific question being asked.
Error Keywords:
- Question misinterpretation
- Contextual misunderstanding
- Incomplete reading
Solution:
The given text is discussing how to visit the OLX website for a specific country. It provides examples like "olx switzerland" or "olx romania" to illustrate that the web address varies based on the country.
The most likely completion of this sentence is choice [REDACTED], which states: "the exact web address varies based on the country selected (for example, olx india is olx.in, olx philippines is olx.ph)."
This choice directly continues the thought about the web address varying by country and provides additional specific examples to illustrate this point.
Instructions:
1. Read the given text carefully and completely.
2. Identify the main topic and purpose of the text.
3. Locate the specific sentence or thought that needs to be completed.
4. Read each answer choice carefully and completely.
5. Evaluate each choice based on how well it completes the specific sentence or thought, not based on the overall topic.
6. Select the choice that most logically and grammatically completes the given sentence.
Advice:
- Always read the entire given text carefully before trying to answer a question about it.
- Make sure you understand what the question is specifically asking for - don't make assumptions.
- Stay focused on the specific sentence or thought that the question is asking about, not just the general topic.
- Evaluate all answer choices thoroughly before selecting the best one; don't just pick the first one that seems somewhat relevant.
- Remember that the correct answer will often complete a thought or idea that was left unfinished in the given text.
