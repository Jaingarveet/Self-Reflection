Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the placement of the books on the shelves. Specifically, I incorrectly assumed that since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be 2 books on the top, 2-3 in the middle, and 3-4 on the bottom. However, this distribution is not the only possibility that satisfies the given conditions. My reasoning led me to incorrectly eliminate answer choice [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
- Incorrect assumption
- Faulty logic
- Incomplete consideration of possibilities
- Prematurely eliminating valid answer choices
Solution:
Given:
- 8 books total: F, G, [REDACTED], K, L, M, O
- 3 shelves: top, middle, bottom
- At least 2 books per shelf
- More books on bottom than top
- I on middle shelf
- K on higher shelf than F
- O on higher shelf than L
- F on same shelf as M
- G on top shelf
If G is on the top shelf:
1. I must be on the middle shelf.
2. K must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as K is higher than F).
3. O must be on the middle or top shelf, but not the bottom (as O is higher than L).
4. F and M must be together on the bottom shelf (as F is with M, and more books are on the bottom than top).
5. L must be on the middle or bottom shelf (as L is lower than O).
Looking at the answer choices with this information:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible, but not enough information to confirm.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible, as there must be at least 2 books per shelf.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED], L - Possible, but not enough information to confirm.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Possible and fits all conditions. K and I on middle, L on bottom.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - Not possible, as F and M must be on the bottom shelf together.
Therefore, the only answer choice that could be a complete and accurate list of the books on the middle shelf is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and given information.
2. Identify the specific conditions and constraints.
3. Consider all possibilities that satisfy the conditions, not just the first one that comes to mind.
4. Systematically evaluate each answer choice against the conditions.
5. Eliminate choices that violate any of the conditions.
6. If multiple choices seem possible, look for additional information to differentiate them.
7. Select the answer choice that satisfies all conditions and constraints.
Advice:
- Don't make assumptions beyond the given information.
- Consider all possibilities that fit the conditions before eliminating any.
- Be systematic and thorough in evaluating each answer choice.
- If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which ones could fit.
- Double-check that your selected answer satisfies all the given conditions.
