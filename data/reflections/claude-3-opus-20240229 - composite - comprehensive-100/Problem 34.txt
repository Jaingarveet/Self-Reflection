Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on the commute times mentioned in the argument and failed to consider the underlying reason why the commute times would increase for most employees after the move. The argument implicitly assumes that there will not be a significant pay raise to offset the increased housing costs near Ocean View.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking implicit assumptions
 - Focusing on irrelevant details
 - Ignoring financial considerations
 - Incomplete analysis of the argument
Solution:
The argument states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View, which is why their commute times will increase after the company moves there. For this to be true, the argument must assume that the employees' pay will not increase enough to make housing near Ocean View affordable. If Acme provided a significant pay raise along with the move, employees might be able to afford closer housing, and the conclusion about increased commute times would not necessarily follow.
[REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED]: While these statements might be true, they are not required for the argument's conclusion to hold.
[REDACTED]: This is the necessary assumption. Without assuming that there will be no significant pay raise, it's possible that employees could afford housing near Ocean View, invalidating the argument's conclusion.
Instructions:
1. Read the argument carefully and identify the conclusion.
2. Look for the gap between the evidence presented and the conclusion.
3. Consider what must be assumed to bridge that gap and make the conclusion follow logically.
4. Examine each answer choice to see if it fulfills the necessary assumption.
5. Select the choice that best represents the missing piece needed for the argument to hold.
Advice:
 - Don't just focus on the explicit details; consider implicit assumptions that the argument relies on.
 - Think about counterexamples that could weaken or invalidate the conclusion if the assumption is not true.
 - Pay attention to the scope of the argument and avoid bringing in irrelevant outside factors.
 - In assumption questions, the correct answer choice will be a statement that is not directly stated but is necessary for the argument's reasoning to be valid.
