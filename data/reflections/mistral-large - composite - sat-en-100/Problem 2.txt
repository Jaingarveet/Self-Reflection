Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused too much on the authors' views on women's roles in society and not enough on the specific inference being asked about running a household and raising children.

Error Keywords:

* Inference error
* Focus error
* Reading comprehension error

Solution:
The authors of Passage 1 believe that women should not aspire to exercise political rights and functions because their delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and duties of motherhood set them apart from strenuous habits and onerous duties and summon them to gentle occupations and cares of the home.

It can be inferred from this statement that the authors believe running a household and raising children entail activities that are gentle and not strenuous or onerous.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific inference being asked.
2. Read the passage carefully and identify the authors' views on the topic being asked about.
3. Identify any specific statements or evidence in the passage that support the inference being asked.
4. Choose the answer choice that best reflects the inference being asked based on the evidence in the passage.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and identify the specific inference being asked.
* Always read the passage carefully and identify the authors' views on the topic being asked about.
* Always identify specific statements or evidence in the passage that support the inference being asked.
* Always choose the answer choice that best reflects the inference being asked based on the evidence in the passage.
* Never make assumptions or inferences that are not supported by the evidence in the passage.
