Explanation: 
I misinterpreted the relationship between self-righteousness and offense. I incorrectly assumed that self-righteous people are expected to be offended by suggestions of unethical behavior. However, the correct answer choice ("E") reflects the idea that self-righteous individuals are easily offended in general, regardless of the nature of the suggestion.

Error Keywords:

Solution: 
The correct answer is "E: Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended."
