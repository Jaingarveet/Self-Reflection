Explanation: I misinterpreted the professor's argument and its underlying assumptions. I focused on the role of intellectual discipline, while the correct answer choice ('C') emphasizes the relationship between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline in specific societal contexts.

Solution: The professor's argument revolves around the tension between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline. While freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue ideas without restraint, the professor introduces the notion that intellectual discipline is necessary to fully explore the implications of interrelated ideas and make true intellectual progress. 

Choice 'C' states: "In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline." This choice directly contradicts the professor's argument, as it suggests that in societies that uphold freedom of thought, thinkers are unable to exercise the necessary intellectual discipline to make meaningful progress. The professor's argument implies that this lack of discipline, resulting from unrestrained freedom, hinders the very progress it aims to facilitate. 

Instructions: 
1. Understand the professor's argument: freedom of thought alone is insufficient for intellectual progress due to the need for intellectual discipline. 
2. Identify the key assumptions and implications: the role of discipline in exploring interrelated ideas and the potential negative consequences of unrestrained freedom. 
3. Analyze each choice: 
- A: While related to intellectual progress, this choice focuses on orthodoxy, which is not directly relevant to the argument. 
- B: Introduces societal values, which are not part of the professor's argument. 
- **C**: Directly contradicts the professor's assertion, implying that freedom of thought leads to a lack of discipline. 
- D: Discusses a benefit of freedom of thought, but ignores the role of intellectual discipline. 
- E: Aligns with the idea that discipline is foundational to freedom of thought, but does not capture the societal context. 

4. Choose the answer that best reflects the assumption underlying the professor's conclusion. 

Advice: 
 - Carefully analyze the argument and identify its underlying assumptions and implications. 
 - Consider the role of each element in the argument and how they relate to one another. 
 - Look for answer choices that directly engage with these assumptions and their potential consequences. 
 - Avoid choices that introduce irrelevant or tangential concepts, even if they are related to the broader topic. 
 - Remember that the correct answer should reflect the logical foundation of the professor's conclusion, not necessarily its broader implications or potential benefits.
