Explanation: I misinterpreted the argument's conclusion and focused too narrowly on the relationship between marketing and enrollment. I overlooked the broader context of the argument, which is about maintaining educational quality and avoiding spending cuts.

Solution: 
The university president's argument is about maintaining educational quality and avoiding spending cuts. The conclusion is that aggressive marketing is necessary to achieve this goal by increasing enrollment. 

To properly draw this conclusion, we must assume that: 
- Increasing enrollment will not negatively impact educational quality (eliminating Choice A).
- Increasing enrollment will prevent the need for spending reductions (supporting Choice B, but not the correct answer).
- Aggressive marketing will lead to increased enrollment (supporting Choice C, but not the correct answer).

The correct answer, Choice D, assumes that educational quality will be compromised if spending is reduced. This assumption directly addresses the argument's conclusion about maintaining quality and the relationship between spending and quality. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the argument's conclusion and its key elements (e.g., maintaining educational quality, increasing enrollment, aggressive marketing). 
2. Understand the relationship between the argument's premises and conclusion (e.g., increasing enrollment prevents spending cuts). 
3. Recognize that the correct answer will likely address the broader context of the argument, not just a single element (e.g., Choice D addresses quality, spending, and their relationship). 
4. Evaluate each choice based on these criteria, selecting the assumption that best supports the argument's conclusion. 

Advice: 
- Consider the broader context of the argument, not just isolated elements. 
- Understand the relationships between the argument's components and how they contribute to the conclusion. 
- Recognize that assumptions often address potential consequences or relationships between variables, filling in logical gaps in the argument. 
- Avoid focusing too narrowly on a single aspect of the argument; consider how the various elements interact to form the conclusion.
