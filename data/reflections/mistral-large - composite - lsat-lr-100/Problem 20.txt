Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too narrowly on the defendant's excuse and the judge's rejection of it, rather than considering the broader principle that underlies the judge's reasoning.

Error Keywords:
 - Narrow focus
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Failure to consider broader principles

Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the fact that the defendant's noncompliance with national codes cannot be excused by confusion with local codes.
The principle that justifies this reasoning is that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
This means that if the defendant was required to comply with national codes, then he was also required to comply with local codes, and his confusion between the two is irrelevant.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
2. Consider the broader principles that underlie the judge's reasoning.
3. Identify the principle that most directly supports the judge's reasoning.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly relevant to the issue or that contradict the principle.
5. Choose the answer that best reflects the principle that supports the judge's reasoning.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
 - Consider the broader principles that underlie the reasoning presented in the question.
 - Avoid focusing too narrowly on specific details or arguments presented in the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not directly relevant to the issue or that contradict the principle.
 - Choose the answer that best reflects the principle that supports the reasoning presented in the question.
