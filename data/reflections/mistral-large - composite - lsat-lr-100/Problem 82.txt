Solution:
Patricia's argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas.
Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the wealthy were not representative of the general population.
Choice [REDACTED] is the strongest counter because it shows that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period, which weakens Tamara's argument that many Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.

Instructions:

1. Identify the argument and the objection.
2. Determine what Patricia needs to show to counter Tamara's objection.
3. Evaluate each choice to determine which one best supports Patricia's argument.
4. Work step-by-step through your reasoning.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that best supports Patricia's argument.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
* Remember that the strongest counter is the one that best supports the original argument.
