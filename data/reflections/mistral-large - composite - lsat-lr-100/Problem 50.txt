Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the behavior of smokers rather than the physiological limit of nicotine absorption.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in understanding the biological mechanism of nicotine absorption.
I misunderstood the finding of the study and did not consider the possibility that the blood cannot absorb more nicotine than a certain limit.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the finding
 - Focusing on behavior rather than physiology
 - Ignoring the possibility of a physiological limit
Solution:
The finding of the nicotine study is that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
This suggests that there is a physiological limit to the amount of nicotine that can be absorbed by the blood.
Choice [REDACTED] states that blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available, which explains why the levels of nicotine in the blood are identical at the end of the day.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the finding of the study.
2. Consider the possible explanations for the finding.
3. Evaluate each answer choice based on its relevance to the finding.
4. Focus on the physiological mechanism of nicotine absorption rather than the behavior of smokers.
5. Consider the possibility of a physiological limit to nicotine absorption.
6. Choose the answer that best explains the finding based on the physiological mechanism of nicotine absorption.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the possible explanations for the finding.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice based on its relevance to the finding.
 - Always focus on the physiological mechanism of the phenomenon rather than the behavior of individuals.
 - Always consider the possibility of a physiological limit to the phenomenon.
 - Always choose the answer that best explains the finding based on the physiological mechanism of the phenomenon.
