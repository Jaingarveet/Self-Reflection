Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the wrong aspect of the information provided. I focused on the increased risk of airborne illnesses due to higher levels of carbon dioxide, rather than the specific comparison between the levels of carbon dioxide in 1980 and today.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of information
- Focusing on the wrong aspect of the information
- Incorrect comparison

Solution:
The information provided states that until 1985, the cabin air in planes was replenished once every 30 minutes, but since then, it has been replenished once every hour. This means that the level of carbon dioxide in planes has increased.

The question asks which statement is most strongly supported by this information. The correct answer is that in 1980, the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. This is because in 1980, the air was replenished more frequently, leading to lower levels of carbon dioxide.
