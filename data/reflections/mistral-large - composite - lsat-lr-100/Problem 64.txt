Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the argument's assumption that crying reduces emotional stress, but I failed to identify the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the subject matter but in the logical reasoning.
I knew the argument's assumption but did not correctly identify the flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Assumption error
 - Causation error
Solution:
The argument assumes that the presence of hormones in tears is the cause of the reduction of emotional stress.
However, the argument does not provide evidence to support this assumption.
The argument takes for granted that because certain substances (hormones) are present whenever a condition (crying) occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition (reduction of emotional stress).
Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's assumption.
2. Identify the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
3. Evaluate the argument's evidence to support its assumption.
4. Determine whether the argument takes for granted that a correlation between two factors implies causation.
5. Choose the answer that matches the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the argument's assumption and the specific flaw in its reasoning.
 - Always evaluate the argument's evidence to support its assumption.
 - Always determine whether the argument takes for granted that a correlation between two factors implies causation.
 - Always choose the answer that matches the specific flaw in the argument's reasoning.
 - Remember that correlation does not imply causation.
