Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused too narrowly on the specific example given in the context and failed to consider the broader principle that could justify Mike's reasoning.

Error Keywords:
 - Narrow focus
 - Failure to consider broader principles
 - Misinterpretation of the question

Solution:
The principle that most closely aligns with Mike's reasoning is that it is permissible to treat people in a way that is similar to the way in which they have treated others. This principle is more general than the one I initially chose, which focused specifically on the use of property without permission.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the reasoning that needs to be justified.
2. Consider the broader principles that could justify this reasoning, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.
3. Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.
4. Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the key issue.
 - Consider the broader principles that could apply to the situation, rather than focusing too narrowly on specific examples.
 - Evaluate each answer choice in light of these broader principles.
 - Choose the answer that most closely aligns with the broader principle that could justify the reasoning.
 - Be aware of the potential for misinterpretation of the question and avoid making assumptions.
