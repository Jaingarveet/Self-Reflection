Instructions:
1. Understand the given information: segment lengths RS, RT, and ST.
2. Identify the relationship between the segments: U is the midpoint of ST.
3. Calculate the length of UT since U is the midpoint: UT = ST / 2.
4. Find the length of RU using the given information: RU = RT - UT.
5. Double-check your calculations and the relationship between the segments.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
