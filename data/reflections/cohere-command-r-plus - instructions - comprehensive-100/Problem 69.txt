Instructions:

1. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ equal.
2. Add (or subtract) the equations to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value found into the original equation to find the other variable.
5. Calculate the value of $x - y$ using the values of $x$ and $y$.
6. Double-check your calculations and the final answer.
