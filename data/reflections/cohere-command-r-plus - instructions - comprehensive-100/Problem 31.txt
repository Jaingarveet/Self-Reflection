Instructions:
1. Understand the researcher's argument: stretching before jogging does not prevent injuries, as evidenced by a study comparing injury rates between stretching and non-stretching joggers. 
2. Identify the key factor in the argument: the similar injury rates between the two groups suggest that stretching has no preventive effect. 
3. Look for a choice that introduces a common factor that could influence the injury rates of both groups, providing an alternative explanation for the similar injury rates. 
4. Choice [REDACTED] introduces the idea that prone-to-injury joggers are more likely to stretch, which could result in a higher propensity for injuries in both groups, regardless of the effectiveness of stretching.
