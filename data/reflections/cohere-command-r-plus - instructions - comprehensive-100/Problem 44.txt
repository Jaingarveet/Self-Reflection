Instructions:
1. Focus on understanding the critic's main argument and the underlying reasons for their objection. 
2. Identify the key elements of their criticism: the impact of historical and social context, the limitations of Western scientific methods, and the need for a neutral stance. 
3. Recognize that the correct answer will likely address these elements directly. 
4. Review the choices: 
   - [REDACTED] is incorrect because it suggests a complete inability to understand, which is not implied in the text. 
   - [REDACTED] emphasizes the influence of historical and social circumstances, directly addressing the critic's main point. 
   - [REDACTED] is incorrect because it focuses on multiple cultural perspectives, which is not the critic's primary concern. 
   - [REDACTED] is incorrect as it contradicts the idea of achieving understanding across cultural differences. 
   - [REDACTED] is a distractor, focusing on liberalism specifically, which is not the critic's main target. 
5. Choose [REDACTED] as the best answer.
