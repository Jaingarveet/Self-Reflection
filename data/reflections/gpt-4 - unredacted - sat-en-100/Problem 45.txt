Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the information given in the passage. The passage mentioned that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that if crops were planted, they might compete with the weeds, potentially reducing the percentage of the surface covered with weeds. I overlooked this implication and instead chose an answer that suggested uncertainty.
Error Keywords:
- Reading comprehension error
- Misinterpretation of information
- Overlooking implications
Solution:
The passage mentions that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This implies that if crops were planted, they might compete with the weeds for resources, potentially reducing the percentage of the surface covered with weeds. Therefore, the correct answer is that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
