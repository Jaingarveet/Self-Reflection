Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the cultural aspect of the paragraph rather than its main purpose. The paragraph does describe a cultural tradition, but its primary purpose is to analyze Chie's reaction to Akira's unconventional approach.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Main idea identification error
- Contextual analysis error
Solution:
The first paragraph introduces Akira's unconventional approach to proposing marriage and questions whether Chie would have been more receptive if he had followed tradition. This analysis of Chie's potential reaction is the main purpose of the paragraph. Therefore, the correct answer is D: analyze a reaction.
