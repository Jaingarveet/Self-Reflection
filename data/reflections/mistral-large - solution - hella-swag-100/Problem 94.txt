Solution:
The young man is playing pool, and after arranging the balls in the metal triangle, he would typically take a shot to break the formation of balls. However, the correct answer is that the young man strikes the white ball but immediately stops it with the cue stick. This action is known as a "frozen" or "stop" shot in pool, where the player intentionally stops the cue ball from moving after hitting the object ball.
