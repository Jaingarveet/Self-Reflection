Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again based on the correct conditions:

Solos: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Pianists: Wayne, Zara

Since the third solo is a traditional piece, we know that Wayne will not perform a traditional piece in the first [REDACTED] solos. Therefore, the first solo will be either a modern piece performed by Wayne or a traditional piece performed by Zara.

In the second solo, Zara will perform a traditional piece, so the third solo must be a modern piece performed by Wayne.

In the [REDACTED]th solo, either Wayne or Zara can perform a traditional piece. Since Wayne has already performed a modern piece in the third solo, Zara can perform a traditional piece in the [REDACTED]th solo.

Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is 2.

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
