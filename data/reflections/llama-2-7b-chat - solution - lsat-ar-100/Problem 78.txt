Solution:
George can give a report on Tuesday, as it is the only day he is allowed to give a report.
Nina can give a report on either Monday or Tuesday, as the conditions do not specify which day she must give her report.
Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday, as the conditions state that he cannot give an afternoon report on that day.
