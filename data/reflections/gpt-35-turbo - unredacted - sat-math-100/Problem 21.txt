Explanation:
I used the correct formula but made a mistake in the calculation.
The correct solution is $x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Quadratic formula error
 - Square root error
Solution:
We can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$, where $a=3, b=12,$ and $c=6$.
Substituting the values, we get:
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{144-72}}{6}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{72}}{6}$
$x=\frac{-12 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}}{6}$
$x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$
Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation.
