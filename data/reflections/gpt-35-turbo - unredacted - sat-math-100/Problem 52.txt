Explanation:
I correctly identified that the number of pears produced by Type B trees is 20% less than Type A trees. However, I made a calculation error in finding the value of x. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Percent decrease error
Solution:
Let's use the formula: 
percent decrease = (original number - new number) / original number x 100%
We can set up the equation as follows:
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100%
20% = (144 - x) / 144 x 100/1
20 = (144 - x) / 1.44
20 x 1.44 = 144 - x
28.8 = 144 - x
x = 144 - 28.8
x = 115.2
Therefore, the Type B trees produced 115.2 pears, which is closest to 120.
Instructions:
1. Identify the percent increase or decrease between the two values.
2. Use the percent decrease formula to set up the equation.
3. Solve for the unknown value using algebraic manipulation.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the given problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that percent decrease is calculated as (original number - new number) / original number x 100%.
