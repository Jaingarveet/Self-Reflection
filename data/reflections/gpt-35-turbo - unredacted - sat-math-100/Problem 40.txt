Explanation:
I correctly solved for $x$ but made an error in the multiplication of $x$ by $3$. 
$3x$ is not equal to $3 \times x$.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic error
 - Multiplication error
Solution:
$20-x=15$ can be solved for $x$ by subtracting $20$ from both sides.
$20-20-x=15-20$
$-x=-5$
$x=5$
$3x=3 \times 5 = 15$
Instructions:
1. Identify the equation to be solved.
2. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
3. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
4. Solve for the variable.
5. Multiply the value of the variable by the given coefficient.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the product of a number and a variable is the result of multiplying them together.
 - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.
