Explanation:
I made an error in adding the imaginary parts. 
I added $3i+9i$ to get $12i$ instead of $12i$.
Error Keywords:
 - Addition error
 - Imaginary number error
 - Complex number error
Solution:
$(7+3i)+(-8+9i)=7+(-8)+(3i+9i)=-1+12i$
Instructions:
1. Identify the real and imaginary parts of each complex number.
2. Add the real parts together.
3. Add the imaginary parts together.
4. Combine the results from steps 2 and 3 to form the sum of the two complex numbers.
5. Write the answer in the form $a+bi$.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the sum of two complex numbers is the sum of their real parts plus the sum of their imaginary parts.
