Explanation:
I correctly identified that the equation of the line passing through $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ is $y-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(x-2)$.
However, I made an error in substituting $x=0$ and $y=0$ in the equation of the line.
When $x=0$ and $y=0$, the equation becomes $-k=\frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$.
Simplifying this equation gives $k^2-8k+16=0$.
Factoring this equation gives $(k-4)(k-4)=0$, so $k=4$ is a repeated root.
However, the question asks for which of the following could be the value of $k$, so we need to check the other answer choices.
Substituting $k=0$ gives a line with a slope of $\frac{32}{-2}=-16$, which does not pass through the origin.
Substituting $k=8$ gives a line with a slope of $\frac{24}{6}=4$, which does pass through the origin.
Substituting $k=16$ gives a line with a slope of $\frac{16}{-14}$, which does not pass through the origin.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }8}$.
