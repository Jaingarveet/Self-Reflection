Explanation:
I used the elimination method to solve the system of equations and found the value of $k$ that makes the system have no solution. However, I made a mistake in my calculation when subtracting the second equation from the first. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
We can use elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& 4k x-12 y=16 \\& 4 x-5ky=7k\end{aligned}$$
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
$$4x-5ky=7k-4kx+12y$$
$$4x+12y=(7k+5k)x$$
$$x=\frac{4+3k}{3k+5}$$
Substituting $x$ in the first equation, we get:
$$k\left(\frac{4+3k}{3k+5}\right)-3y=4$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$3k^2-16k+20=0$$
$$(3k-10)(k-2)=0$$
$k=\frac{10}{3}$ or $k=2$
If $k=\frac{10}{3}$, then the system of equations has a unique solution.
If $k=2$, then the system of equations has no solution.
Instructions:
1. Identify the method to solve the system of equations.
2. Multiply one equation by a constant to make the coefficients of one variable equal in both equations.
3. Multiply the other equation by a constant to make the coefficients of the same variable equal in both equations.
4. Add or subtract the two equations to eliminate one variable.
5. Solve for the remaining variable.
6. Substitute the value of the variable in one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.
7. Check the solution by substituting the values of the variables in both equations.
8. If the system has no solution, the equations will be inconsistent, and the coefficients of one variable will be proportional but not equal.
Advice:
 - Always double-check your algebraic manipulations.
 - Always check your solution by substituting the values of the variables in both equations.
 - Remember that the coefficients of one variable must be proportional but not equal in inconsistent systems.
