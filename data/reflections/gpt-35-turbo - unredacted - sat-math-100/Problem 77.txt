Explanation:
I correctly calculated the mean of both lists, but I made an error in calculating the standard deviation of list A. 
The standard deviation of list A is $\sqrt{\frac{(1-3.5)^2+(2-3.5)^2+(3-3.5)^2+(4-3.5)^2+(5-3.5)^2+(6-3.5)^2}{6}}\approx1.71$.
Therefore, the correct answer is A, not D.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Standard deviation error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
The mean of list A is $\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}=3.5$.
The mean of list B is $\frac{2+3+3+4+4+5}{6}=3.5$.
The standard deviation of list A is $\sqrt{\frac{(1-3.5)^2+(2-3.5)^2+(3-3.5)^2+(4-3.5)^2+(5-3.5)^2+(6-3.5)^2}{6}}\approx1.71$.
The standard deviation of list B is $\sqrt{\frac{(2-3.5)^2+(3-3.5)^2+(3-3.5)^2+(4-3.5)^2+(4-3.5)^2+(5-3.5)^2}{6}}\approx0.96$.
Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Calculate the mean of both lists.
3. Calculate the standard deviation of both lists.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated results.
Advice:
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a distribution.
 - Remember that the mean is a measure of the central tendency of a distribution.
 - Be careful when calculating the standard deviation, as it involves multiple steps.
