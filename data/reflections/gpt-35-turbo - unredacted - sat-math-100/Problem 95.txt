Explanation:
I misinterpreted the meaning of the coefficient of $L$ in the formula. 
The coefficient of $L$ represents the approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length. 
I misread the question and chose the wrong answer. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Misreading
 - Incorrect answer choice
Solution:
The formula is $H=1.88 L+32.01$.
The coefficient of $L$ is 1.88.
The coefficient of $L$ represents the approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length.
Therefore, the meaning of 1.88 in this context is the approximate increase in a man's height, in inches, for each one-inch increase in his femur length.
