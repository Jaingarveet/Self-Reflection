Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning when I assumed that the other integer must be a factor of 700.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.
I knew the correct GCF and one of the integers but made an incorrect assumption about the other integer.
