Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the new ratio of boys to girls.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem but in correctly interpreting the given information.
I knew the correct initial ratio and the correct new ratio but misinterpreted the information about the same number of boys and girls joining the group.
