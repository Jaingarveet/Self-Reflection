Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation when setting up the proportion.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem or the concept of ratios, but in my arithmetic calculation.
I incorrectly rounded up the result of the proportion to the nearest whole number, instead of rounding down.
