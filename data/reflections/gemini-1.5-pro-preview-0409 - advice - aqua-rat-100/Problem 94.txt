Advice:
 - Pay close attention to whether repetition is allowed or not in counting problems.
 - Clearly distinguish between permutations (order matters) and combinations (order doesn't matter).
 - When in doubt, consider a small example to understand the counting principle involved.
 - Always double-check your calculations and ensure your answer aligns with the problem's requirements.
