Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the relationship between the number of pickets and the number of spaces. Remember that the number of spaces is typically one less than the number of pickets in a fence-like structure.
 - Draw a diagram to visualize the problem.
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure you have accounted for all components of the structure. 
 - Be mindful of off-by-one errors, which are common in counting problems.
