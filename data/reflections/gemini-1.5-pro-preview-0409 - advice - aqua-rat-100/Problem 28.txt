Advice:
- Pay close attention to the specific wording of the question, especially terms like "greatest value."
- Consider the relationships and constraints between events when dealing with probabilities.
- Remember that the probability of multiple events not occurring together is always less than or equal to the probability of each individual event not occurring. 
- In probability problems, explore different scenarios and their implications to avoid overlooking crucial constraints.
