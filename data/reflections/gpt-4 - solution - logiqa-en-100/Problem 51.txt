Solution:
Given that X and F are in the same department, and F must be in the production department, X is also in the production department. According to condition (3), W must also be in the production department. This means that three people (F, X, W) are already in the production department. Since H and Y must be in the same department, and the production department is full, H cannot be in the production department. Therefore, the statement "H is assigned to the production department" cannot be true.
