Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: "[REDACTED] listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends." This is because the original statement implies that a company with dividends does not need financing. Therefore, if a listed company does not need financing, it could be a company with dividends. Conversely, if it is not a company with dividends, it could be because it needs financing.
