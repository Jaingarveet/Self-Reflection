Solution:
The economist's hypothesis is based on the idea that transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries can increase total global welfare. This is because developed countries benefit from an improved natural environment, while developing countries, despite suffering environmental pollution, gain employment and increased taxes. This implies that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries (A), which is the correct answer.
