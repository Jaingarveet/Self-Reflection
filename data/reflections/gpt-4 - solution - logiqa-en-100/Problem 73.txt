Solution:
Given that G is in team 1 and must be in the front position (condition 1), and L must also be in team 1 (condition 3), the remaining position for L is either middle or back. K cannot be in team 1 because if L takes the back position, K cannot be in the middle (condition 2). N can be in team 1 because neither P nor K are in team 1 (condition 4). P cannot be in team 1 because N is in team 1 (condition 4) and Q cannot be in team 1 because the position of H is not specified (condition 6). Therefore, the only possible pair of magicians that can be in team 1 with G is [REDACTED].
