Solution:
Given that F and M are not in charge of the same department, and F and G are not in charge of the same department, F must be in charge of a department alone. Similarly, since H and I are not in charge of the same department, one of them must be in charge of a department alone. However, one assistant can manage all three departments. If F, H, and I each manage a department alone, the assistant managing all three departments must be either G, M, or P. This leaves two assistants to share the remaining department. Since F, G, H, and M each manage a department alone, the only possible pair left to share a department is I and P.
