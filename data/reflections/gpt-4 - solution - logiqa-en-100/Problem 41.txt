Solution:
The statement says that if Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can also achieve a 20% increase. It also says that Green Island must increase productivity by 10% to avoid bankruptcy. Therefore, if Green Island cannot achieve a 20% increase, which is a higher threshold than the necessary 10%, it will certainly not meet the minimum requirement of 10% and will go bankrupt. So, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
