Solution:
The argument is that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad. The best counter-argument would be one that provides a different reason for the increase in Chinese investment in US real estate, but also directly counters the argument about wealth transfer. 
Option B: "[REDACTED]" provides a different reason for the increase in Chinese investment (speculation rather than wealth transfer), thus it is the best counter-argument.
