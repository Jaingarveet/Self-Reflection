Solution:
Xiao Wang refutes Xiao Chen's views by pointing out that the observation of the comet's flicker was not unusual but was the result of continuous and careful tracking observation. This suggests that the flicker might have been observed before if such careful observation had been done. However, this doesn't provide an alternative explanation, but rather points out that Xiao Chen's argument is lacking in persuasion because it's based on an assumption. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
