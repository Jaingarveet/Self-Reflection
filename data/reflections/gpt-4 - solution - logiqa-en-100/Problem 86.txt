Solution:
From the context, we know that Fuyi Station is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station. This means that the order from west to east is Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao. We also know that Jiushang Station is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station, so Jiushang could be placed either between Haoyun and Fuyi or to the east of Fuyi. However, since Jiushang Station is also adjacent to Yinling Station, the only possible order is Haoyun, Fuyi, Jiushang, Yinling, Huyao. Therefore, Huyao is standing on the east side.
