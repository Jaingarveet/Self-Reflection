Solution:
1. The team cannot go to I Peak, so they cannot reach Lake J (according to condition 4).
2. Therefore, they must visit Lake G to satisfy condition 1 (at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited).
3. If they visit Lake G, they must visit either City E or City F (according to condition 2).
4. They can't go to Mountain H without going to City E (according to condition 3), and since they can't go to Mountain H, they can't go to City E.
5. Therefore, they must go to City F.
6. So, the group went to City F and Lake G.
