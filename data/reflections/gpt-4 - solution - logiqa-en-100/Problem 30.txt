Solution:
The conditions are:
1) At least one person of Bingding is selected.
2) If E is selected, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are also selected.
3) [REDACTED] maximum of 2 people are selected.
From condition 1, at least one person from Bing and Ding must be selected. From condition 2, if E is selected, then [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] must also be selected, but this would violate condition 3, which states that a maximum of 2 people are selected. Therefore, E cannot be selected. 
Since a maximum of 2 people can be selected and at least one of them must be from Bing and Ding, the other person cannot be [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or E. Therefore, the only remaining option is [REDACTED]. 
However, the question asks who is not in the fourth, not who can be selected. Since [REDACTED] can be selected, the answer is [REDACTED].
