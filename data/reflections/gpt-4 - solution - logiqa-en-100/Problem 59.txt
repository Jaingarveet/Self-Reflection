Solution:
Let's go through each choice again, keeping in mind the correct interpretation of condition 3.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: F, H, Y; Sales Department: G, I, X
This choice does not meet condition 3, which states that if X is in the sales department, then W cannot be in the sales department.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: G, I, X; Sales Department: F, H, Y
This choice does not meet condition 4, which states that F must be in the production department.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, Y, W
This choice does not meet condition 2, which states that F and G cannot be in the same department.
Choice [REDACTED]: 
Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, I, W; Sales Department: G, H, Y
This choice meets all conditions. H and Y are in the same department, F and G are not in the same department, X is not in the sales department, and F is in the production department.
