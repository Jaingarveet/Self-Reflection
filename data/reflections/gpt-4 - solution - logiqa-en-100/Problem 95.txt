Solution:
Premier Wen Jiabao's statement is about the impact of China's large population on problem-solving and resource distribution. He is saying that even a small problem can become big when multiplied by 1.3 billion, and a large total can become small when divided by 1.3 billion. This is a comment on the complexity and scale of issues in a country with a large population. The Chinese proverb "Everyone collects firewood and the flame is high" in option [REDACTED] metaphorically conveys the same idea, as it implies that small contributions can lead to significant results when multiplied by a large population.
