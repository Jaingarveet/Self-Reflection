Solution:
The statement implies that the boss's profit and the employees' wages are inversely related. This suggests a potential conflict of interest between the boss and the employees. If the employees do not hold shares in the enterprise, they would not benefit from the boss's profit, which could lead to conflicts of interest. Therefore, the conclusion most strongly supported by the statement is "[REDACTED]"
