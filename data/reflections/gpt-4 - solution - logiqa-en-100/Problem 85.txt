Solution:
From the context, we know that paper E cannot be used. This means that paper F can be used, but it doesn't necessarily mean that paper K cannot be used. From point (2), we know that either paper G or paper H can be used, but not both, and not with paper J. From point (3), we know that if paper G is not used, then paper K is not necessary. Since paper E is not used and paper G is not necessary, then paper K is not necessary. Therefore, no paper J, but paper K.
