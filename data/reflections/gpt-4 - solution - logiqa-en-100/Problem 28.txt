Solution:
Let's analyze each choice again:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If F is selected, then M may or may not be selected. This leaves two spots for either E or (J and G) or K. This is not a valid choice.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If J is selected, then G must be selected. This leaves two spots for either E or F and either H or M. This is not a valid choice.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If M is selected, then F must be selected. This leaves only one spot for either E or (J and G) or K. This is not a valid choice.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - If M is selected, then F must be selected. This leaves two spots for either E or (J and G). This is a valid choice.
