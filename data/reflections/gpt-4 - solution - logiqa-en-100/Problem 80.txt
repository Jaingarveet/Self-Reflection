Solution:
Given the conditions:
1) The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3) The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
From these conditions, we can deduce that:
- The finance department and planning department must be adjacent, but the finance department could be either above or below the planning department.
- The administrative department must be above the planning department but below the human resources department.
- The human resources department cannot be adjacent to the sales department.
By trying different arrangements, we find that the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is: [REDACTED].
