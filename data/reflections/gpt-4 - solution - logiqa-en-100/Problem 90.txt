Solution:
The statement suggests that maintaining economic development requires strengthening the competitiveness of domestic enterprises. However, maintaining social stability requires establishing social security systems, which reduces the competitiveness of enterprises. This creates a paradox where the country cannot maintain both its economic development and social stability simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is that this country cannot maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.
