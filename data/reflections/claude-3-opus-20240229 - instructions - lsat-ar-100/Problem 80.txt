Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the rules/constraints.
2. Go through each answer choice one by one.
3. For each choice, check if it violates any of the stated rules.
4. If a choice violates a rule, eliminate it and move to the next choice.
5. If a choice satisfies all the rules, select it as the correct answer.
6. Double-check that the selected answer indeed satisfies all rules.
7. Watch out for implicit rules that arise from combining explicit rules.
