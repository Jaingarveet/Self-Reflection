Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand each constraint given in the problem.
2. Make a list of all the constraints and the lab assistants they apply to.
3. Start with the most restrictive constraints and assign lab assistants to sessions accordingly.
4. Work through the constraints systematically, ensuring that each new assignment does not violate any previously satisfied constraints.
5. If a constraint leads to an impossible situation, backtrack and reconsider previous assignments.
6. Once all constraints are satisfied, check which lab assistant must lead a session on the day in question.
7. Select the answer choice that matches your conclusion.
