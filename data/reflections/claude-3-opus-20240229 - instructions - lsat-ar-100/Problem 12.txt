Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and note all constraints on the order of events.
2. Identify the specific constraints on each individual element (house).
3. Consider the possible positions for each element based on its constraints.
4. For each answer choice, check if the pair of elements can be placed consecutively while satisfying all constraints.
5. Eliminate answer choices that allow the pair to be consecutive.
6. Select the answer choice that cannot be consecutive due to the constraints.
