1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed constraints (e.g. George must present on Tuesday).
3. Consider each answer choice one-by-one.
4. For each choice, try to construct a scenario that satisfies all the constraints.
5. If you can find a valid scenario, then that answer choice is possible.
6. If you cannot find a valid scenario after thorough consideration, then that answer choice is impossible.
7. Choose the answer that represents a possible scenario.
