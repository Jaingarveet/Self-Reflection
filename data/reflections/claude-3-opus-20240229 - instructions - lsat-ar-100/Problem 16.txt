Instructions:
1. Carefully read each constraint and make sure you understand exactly what it means. 
2. Evaluate each answer choice against the first constraint, eliminating any that violate it.
3. From the remaining choices, evaluate each against the second constraint, eliminating violators.
4. Continue this process for each subsequent constraint until only one choice remains.
5. For constraints involving relative terms like "earlier", consider all valid interpretations.
6. Remember that "earlier day of the week" allows for gaps between days, not just adjacent days.
7. The correct choice is the one that satisfies all constraints, not just most of them.
