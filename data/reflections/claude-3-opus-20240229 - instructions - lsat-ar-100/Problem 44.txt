Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed elements (e.g., Greyhounds on day 1).
3. Identify the flexible elements and their constraints (e.g., Himalayans on exactly three days, but not day 1 or 7).
4. Consider each answer choice one by one.
5. For each choice, try to construct a scenario that satisfies all constraints.
6. If a scenario can be constructed, the choice could be true; if not, it must be false.
7. Eliminate choices that lead to contradictions or violate constraints.
8. Choose the answer that remains as the only possibility.
