Instructions:
1. Read the question and constraints carefully. Make sure you understand each one.
2. Consider each answer choice one by one. Don't eliminate choices too hastily.
3. For each constraint, check if the current answer choice satisfies it. If not, eliminate that choice.
4. If a choice satisfies all constraints, it could be the correct answer. Keep it as a possibility.
5. After considering all choices, if more than one satisfies all constraints, any of them could be the answer.
6. If the question asks for just one possible answer, select any one of the remaining valid choices.
