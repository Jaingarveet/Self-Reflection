Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the key constraints and their implications.
3. Consider the implications of each constraint individually.
4. Then, consider the implications of the constraints in combination.
5. Methodically reason through the scenarios, considering both what must be true and what cannot be true in each case.
6. Eliminate answer choices that are inconsistent with the constraints.
7. Identify the answer choice(s) that remain possible after considering all constraints.
