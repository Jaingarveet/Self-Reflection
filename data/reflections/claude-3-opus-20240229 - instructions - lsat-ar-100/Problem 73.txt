2. Identify the fixed conditions (e.g., Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane).
3. Deduce the implications of the fixed conditions (e.g., Kramer and O'Neill review the same play(s)).
4. Consider the hypothetical condition (exactly three students review Undulation).
5. Systematically consider the possibilities for the remaining students, ensuring no conditions are violated.
6. Evaluate each answer choice against the deduced scenarios to see if it could be true.
7. Choose the answer that is definitely false based on the conditions.
