Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify all the given constraints.
2. Evaluate each answer choice individually.
3. For each choice, check if it satisfies every single requirement.
4. If a choice violates any requirement, eliminate it.
5. If a choice satisfies all requirements, keep it as a possible answer.
6. After evaluating all choices, select the choice(s) that satisfy all the given constraints.
7. If multiple choices satisfy all constraints, look for additional information to narrow down to one choice.
