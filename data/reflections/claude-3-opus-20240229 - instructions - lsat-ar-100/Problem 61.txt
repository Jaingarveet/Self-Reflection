Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Consider each constraint one by one.
3. For each answer choice, determine if it violates any of the given constraints.
4. If a choice violates a constraint, rule it out as a possibility.
5. If a choice satisfies all constraints, keep it as a possible answer.
6. The correct answer will be the choice that CANNOT be true based on the constraints.
7. Double-check your reasoning for each choice before selecting your final answer.
