Solution:
The video cuts to the beach and the man begins to surf. He catches waves but wipes out early on most of them. The video is likely showing his failed attempts for dramatic/comedic effect. In this context, a surprising visual like a bird divebombing into the ocean would be an eye-catching way to punctuate the scene and add to the action-oriented feel, even if it's not literally related to the surfing. The phrasing "appears to divebomb" also suggests a quick cut of dramatic imagery, which fits the video editing style, as opposed to a mundane shot of a bird on the shore.
