Solution:
The given text is written in an exaggerated, satirical style presenting intentionally questionable advice for dealing with a high-pressure job. Clues that this is tongue-in-cheek rather than sincere include:
- The informal, conversational tone 
- Odd motivational phrases like "The lower you've hit bottom, the higher you will go"
- The suggestion to "stop caring" as a solution
- The [header] label presenting this as "How to escape extreme pressure employment"
Answer [REDACTED] provides the best continuation of this satirical tone, with references to acting like you don't need money and believing "from deep in your gut" that you can do better. This matches the style of exaggerated, unhelpful advice in the original text.
