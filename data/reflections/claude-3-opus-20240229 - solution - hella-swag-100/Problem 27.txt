Solution:
[REDACTED] large group of people are seen sitting around an auditorium with one man flying kites around in the middle. 
The scene suggests the man is giving some kind of kite-flying demonstration or performance for the audience.
It's likely that after some time, the man will finish flying the kites.
The most plausible next step is that the man will walk away and someone else, in this case a woman, will start speaking to the crowd, perhaps to explain or discuss the kite-flying demonstration.
Therefore, the most likely completion is: "[REDACTED]"
