Solution:
The area of the square is side^2 = 20^2 = 400 cm^2.
The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 20/2 = 10 cm.
The area of a full circle is πr^2, so the area of each semicircle is (π(10)^2)/2 = 50π cm^2.
The area of both semicircles is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles = 400 - 100π cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is approximately 314.16 cm^2, which is not an option. However, if the question intended to ask for the area in square meters, then the correct answer would be approximately 0.0314 m^2, which rounds to 0.03 m^2. This is still not an option, so the question may be flawed.
