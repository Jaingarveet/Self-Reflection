Solution:
The man's speed in still water is 4 kmph. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. This means the current's speed is 4 - 2 = 2 kmph. 
When the man rows along the current, his speed is his speed in still water plus the speed of the current. So, his speed along the current is 4 + 2 = [REDACTED]. The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
