Solution:
Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. So, the total length for each picket including the space is 6.5 inches (6 + 0.5). 
However, there is no space after the last picket, so we need to subtract 6 inches from the total length.
The total length in inches is then 6.5x - 6.
To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot). 
So, the length in feet is (6.5x - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24.
