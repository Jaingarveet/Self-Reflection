Solution:
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
The probability that Stock [REDACTED] will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = [REDACTED].
The greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is the maximum of these two probabilities, which is 0.44.
