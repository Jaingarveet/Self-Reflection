Solution:
Let's denote the amount of money Arjun has as [REDACTED] and the amount of money Sajal has as S. 
From the first condition, we have the equation: S + 30 = 2([REDACTED] - 30).
From the second condition, we have the equation: [REDACTED] + 10 = 3(S - 10).
Solving these two equations, we get:
S = 2[REDACTED] - 60 and [REDACTED] = 3S - 30.
Substituting the value of S from the first equation into the second, we get:
[REDACTED] = 3(2[REDACTED] - 60) - 30.
Solving this equation, we get [REDACTED] = 62.
Substituting [REDACTED] = 62 into the first equation, we get S = 34.
