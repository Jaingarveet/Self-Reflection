Solution:
The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: 
Sum = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d) 
where n is the number of terms (members in this case), a is the first term (age of the youngest member), and d is the common difference.
We can set up the equation: 
[REDACTED]0 = n/2 * (2*7 + (n-1)*0.[REDACTED])
Solving this equation will give us the number of members in the club.
Rearranging the equation gives:
n^2 + 4n - [REDACTED]00 = 0
Solving this quadratic equation gives n = [REDACTED] or n = -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members in the club is [REDACTED].
