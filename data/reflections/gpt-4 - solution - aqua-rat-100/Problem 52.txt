Solution:
For alloy X, the total ratio is 6+9=15. So, the amount of zinc is 6/15*40=16 grams and the amount of copper is 9/15*40=24 grams.
For alloy Y, the total ratio is 7+11=18. So, the amount of zinc is 7/18*60=23.33 grams and the amount of copper is 11/18*60=36.67 grams.
Then, we add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The amount of zinc is 16+23.33=39.33 grams and the amount of copper is 24+36.67=60.67 grams.
Finally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio is approximately 39:61, which is not one of the choices.
However, if we round the amounts to the nearest whole number, we get 39 grams of zinc and 61 grams of copper, which gives a ratio of 39:61. This is also not one of the choices.
Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.
