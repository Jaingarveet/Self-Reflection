Solution:
The correct simplification of the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) is x = n + 4. 
So, if 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then 40 ≤ x ≤ 76. 
However, none of the given options [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED] fully cover this range. 
The closest option is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], which partially covers the range of x.
