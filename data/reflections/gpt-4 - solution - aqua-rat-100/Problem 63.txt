Solution:
The team won 20 matches and lost [REDACTED]% of their matches. 
Let's denote the total number of matches as X. 
So, [REDACTED]% of X equals 20 (because if they lost [REDACTED]% then they won [REDACTED]%). 
We can write this as 0.[REDACTED]X = 20. 
Solving for X gives X = 20 / 0.[REDACTED] = approximately 28.[REDACTED][REDACTED]. 
Since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this up to 29 matches. 
So, the team lost [REDACTED]% of 29 matches, which is approximately 8.[REDACTED] matches. 
Again, since the number of matches must be a whole number, we round this down to 8 matches. 
But the closest answer choice is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
