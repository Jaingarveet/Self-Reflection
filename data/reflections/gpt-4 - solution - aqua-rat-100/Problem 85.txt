Solution:
In the first scenario, you walk 20 steps and then stop, and the elevator takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the remaining steps the elevator travels alone are covered in 10 minutes.
In the second scenario, you walk 10 steps and then stop, and the elevator takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the remaining steps the elevator travels alone are covered in 20 minutes.
Since the number of steps you walk changes but the time it takes for the elevator to cover the remaining steps does not, the speed of the elevator is 1 step per minute.
