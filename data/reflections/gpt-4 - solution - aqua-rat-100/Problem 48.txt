Solution:
24% of all students are members of both a chess club and a swim team. This means that these students are also part of the swim team.
If [REDACTED] of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, it means that 80% of the swim team members are also members of the chess club. 
So, if 24% represents 80% of the swim team, we can find the total percentage of the swim team by dividing 24% by 80% and multiplying by 100% to convert it back to a percentage. 
24% / 80% * 100% = [REDACTED]
