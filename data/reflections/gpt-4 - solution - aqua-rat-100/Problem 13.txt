Solution:
Let's denote the number as x. The student should have found 7/8*x but instead found 7/18*x. The difference between these two values is 770. So, we can write the equation as follows:
7/8*x - 7/18*x = 770
To solve this equation, we first need to find a common denominator for 8 and 18, which is 72. So, we rewrite the equation as:
63/72*x - 28/72*x = 770
Combine the fractions:
35/72*x = 770
To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 35/72, which is 72/35:
x = 770 * 72/35
x = [REDACTED]
