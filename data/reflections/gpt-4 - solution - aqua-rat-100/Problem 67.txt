Solution:
First, we can set up ratios to represent the relationships between the different types of breads. 
From the first sentence, we know that 6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls. So, 1 roll = [REDACTED] pita breads.
From the second sentence, we know that [REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes. So, 1 baguette = [REDACTED]/5 rolls.
We want to find out how many pita breads are in [REDACTED] baguettes. 
So, [REDACTED] baguettes = [REDACTED] * ([REDACTED]/5 rolls) = 6/5 rolls.
And since 1 roll = [REDACTED] pita breads, 6/5 rolls = 6/5 * [REDACTED] pita breads = 18/5 = [REDACTED].6 pita breads.
Therefore, [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] pita breads.
