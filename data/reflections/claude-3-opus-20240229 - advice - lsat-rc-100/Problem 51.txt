Advice:
 - Always read referenced sentences carefully in context of the surrounding text.
 - Distinguish between the author expressing their own views versus reporting the views of others.
 - Look for keywords that signal agreement, disagreement or contrast between ideas.
 - Map out the key ideas in each sentence and directly compare them to determine relationships.
 - Eliminate answer choices that do not accurately describe the sentence relationship based on the text.
