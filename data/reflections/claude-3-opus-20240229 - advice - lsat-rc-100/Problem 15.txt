Advice:
 - Always read the passages closely, but focus on discerning their high-level arguments and motivations, not just the specific details they discuss.
 - Look for thematic similarities between the passages' lines of argument, even when they reach different ultimate conclusions.
 - Differentiate between minor overlapping details and the core principles underlying both passages' reasoning.
 - Synthesize the arguments from a bird's-eye view to identify the key premises or assumptions both passages build upon.
 - Select an answer that captures the common foundation of the passages' arguments, not just a detail they both mention in passing.
