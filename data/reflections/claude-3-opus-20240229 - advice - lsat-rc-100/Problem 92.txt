Advice:
 - Always focus on the core issues and main points of arguments, rather than getting sidetracked by tangential details.
 - When evaluating objections, look for counterarguments that directly challenge the reasoning or assumptions of the argument being criticized.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to engage with the key points under discussion.
 - Remember that the strongest objection will be the one that most fundamentally undermines the reasoning of the argument being challenged.
