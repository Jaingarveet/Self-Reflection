Advice:
- Always read passages closely to determine their specific focus and scope.
- Look for keywords indicating if a passage is discussing a specific case or a field in general.
- Consider the broader implications of each passage, not just the specific details.
- When comparing passages, analyze their scope relative to each other.
- Be careful not to confuse a passage's tone with its scope or focus.
