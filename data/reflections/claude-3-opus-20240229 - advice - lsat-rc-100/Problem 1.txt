Advice:
 - Always read the passage carefully, considering the views of all groups or individuals discussed.
 - When a question focuses on a particular group's perspective, prioritize what the passage directly says about that group's views.
 - Consider the full implications of a group's perspective, not just the most obvious aspects.
 - Evaluate all answer choices carefully, looking for the one that most completely captures the group's likely view on the specific situation presented.
 - Be careful not to be overly narrow in your analysis; consider the group's perspective holistically.
