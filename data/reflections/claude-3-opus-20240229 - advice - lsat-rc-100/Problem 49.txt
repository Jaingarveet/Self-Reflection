Advice:
 - Always pay close attention to sentences that define key terms or explain important concepts, as these often contain the main ideas of the passage.
 - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is mentioned in the passage; look for the choice that is most strongly implied or supported by the passage as a whole.
 - If you're torn between two answers, refer back to the question stem to determine which one is a better fit for what is being asked.
 - Don't make assumptions or read things into the passage that aren't there; stick closely to what is directly stated or implied.
