Advice:
- Always read questions carefully to ensure you're selecting an answer choice that fits all criteria. 
- Consider each choice in light of the specific assertion or argument being tested.
- Don't get tunnel vision looking only for direct counterarguments; more subtle challenges to an argument can be equally or more effective.
- Eliminate choices methodically based on relevance to the assertion and the question being asked.
- Select the choice that best fulfills the question, even if it's not the most obvious at first glance.
