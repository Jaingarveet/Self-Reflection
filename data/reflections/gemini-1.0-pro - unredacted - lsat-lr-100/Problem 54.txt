Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the reasoning error in the argument. 
The argument assumes that because Hana received a recording from her brothers, they must have been at her party. However, it is possible that they gave her the recording without attending the party. 
The argument fails to establish that something true of some people (Hana's brothers who gave her the recording) is true of only those people (Hana's brothers who attended her party).
Error Keywords:
 - Scope error
 - Quantifier error
 - Existential fallacy
Solution:
The argument states that Hana said she was not going to invite her brothers to her birthday party.
The argument then states that among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest.
The argument then states that since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all.
The error in the argument is that it fails to establish that something true of some people (Hana's brothers who gave her the recording) is true of only those people (Hana's brothers who attended her party).
It is possible that Hana's brothers gave her the recording without attending the party.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conclusion of the argument.
2. Identify the premises of the argument.
3. Determine whether the premises provide sufficient support for the conclusion.
4. If the premises do not provide sufficient support for the conclusion, identify the reasoning error in the argument.
5. Choose the answer that correctly identifies the reasoning error in the argument.
