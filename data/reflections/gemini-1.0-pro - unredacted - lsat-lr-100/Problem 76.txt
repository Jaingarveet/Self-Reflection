Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the argument that most closely resembled the original argument. 
My error was in failing to recognize that the original argument was about the desirability of a certain action (adopting a fish-based diet) and the undesirable consequences of its universal adoption. 
Only two of the answer choices shared this structure: A and C. 
I chose A because it was the first answer choice that seemed to fit this structure, but I failed to consider the other answer choices carefully enough.
Error Keywords:
 - Inattentive reading
 - Failure to consider all options
 - Jumping to conclusions
Solution:
The original argument states that a certain action (adopting a fish-based diet) is desirable but would have undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
Choice A: This argument is similar in structure to the original argument. It states that taking vitamin E supplements is desirable but could have undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
Choice B: This argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. It discusses the potential need for alternative sources of revenue if tobacco taxes are increased.
Choice C: This argument is similar in structure to the original argument. It states that limiting purchases to what one truly needs is desirable but would have undesirable consequences if universally adopted.
Choice D: This argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. It discusses the reasons why legislators spend so much time campaigning.
Choice E: This argument is not similar in structure to the original argument. It discusses the trade-offs involved in designating certain areas as wilderness areas.
The correct answer is C.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the original argument and identify its structure.
2. Identify the answer choices that share the same structure as the original argument.
3. Carefully consider each of the answer choices that share the same structure as the original argument.
4. Choose the answer choice that most closely resembles the original argument in terms of its reasoning.
5. Do not jump to conclusions; consider all of the answer choices carefully.
