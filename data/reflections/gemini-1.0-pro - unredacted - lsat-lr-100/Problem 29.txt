Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption that supports the argument's conclusion. 
My error was in focusing on the behavior of rational consumers rather than their expectations. 
The argument claims that consumers who do not bother to acquire information are behaving rationally because they do not expect the benefits to outweigh the costs. 
I mistakenly focused on the statement that it is rational not to acquire information, overlooking the crucial element of expectations.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the argument's premise
 - Focus on behavior instead of expectations
 - Failure to identify the key assumption
Solution:
The argument states that consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase are behaving rationally.
The conclusion is based on the assumption that it is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.
Option A states that rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information. This aligns with the argument's premise.
Option B states that whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information. This is not relevant to the argument's conclusion.
Option C states that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. This contradicts the argument's premise.
Option D states that rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. This contradicts the argument's premise.
Option E states that consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. This aligns with the argument's premise.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify its conclusion.
2. Identify the assumption that supports the argument's conclusion.
3. Consider each answer choice and determine whether it accurately reflects the assumption that supports the conclusion.
4. Choose the answer choice that aligns with the argument's premise and supports its conclusion.
Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the wording of the argument and the answer choices.
 - Distinguish between facts, assumptions, and conclusions.
 - Focus on the expectations of rational consumers, not just their behavior.
 - Eliminate answer choices that contradict the argument's premise or are irrelevant to its conclusion.
 - Choose the answer choice that provides the strongest support for the argument's conclusion.
