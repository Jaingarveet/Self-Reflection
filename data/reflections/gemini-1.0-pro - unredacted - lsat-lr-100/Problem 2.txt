## Explanation:
My initial reasoning was sound, but I failed to consider all implications of the given information. While it's true that some films winning prizes at international festivals were Canadian, the prompt doesn't guarantee that **all** such films were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. Therefore, the possibility exists that a film could win a prize at Lac Nichoutec without being shown internationally.
## Error Keywords:

    * Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival.
    * Most films winning prizes at Lac Nichoutec also won prizes internationally.

    * This implies some films winning prizes internationally are Canadian.
    * However, it doesn't guarantee all such films were shown at Lac Nichoutec.
3. **Evaluate answer choices:**
    * Only option D aligns with this analysis: some Lac Nichoutec winners might not have been shown internationally.
