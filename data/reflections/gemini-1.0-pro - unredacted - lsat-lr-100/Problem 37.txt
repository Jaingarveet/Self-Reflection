Solution:
Smith's statements can most directly be used as part of an argument for which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: A democratic government does not infringe on the rights of any of its citizens.
  B: Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them.
  C: News programs for children would give them enough information to enable them to vote in an informed way.
  D: If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted.
  E: If parents do not adequately represent their children's interests in the political sphere, those interests will be adequately represented by someone else.
Smith argues that even if children are told about the issues affecting them, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults. This suggests that Smith believes that children are not capable of making informed decisions about how to vote, and therefore, denying them the vote is a necessary limitation on full democracy.
