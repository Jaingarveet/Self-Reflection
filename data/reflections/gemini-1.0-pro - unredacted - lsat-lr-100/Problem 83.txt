## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the immediate cause of Pluto's status change (ejection from Neptune's orbit) rather than the underlying defining characteristic of a true planet. 
## Error Keywords:
* **Misinterpretation of the argument's core:** I mistakenly focused on the event of ejection instead of the broader definition of a planet.
* **Logical fallacy:** I committed the "post hoc ergo propter hoc" fallacy, assuming that because Pluto was ejected, that event caused its status change, when in reality, the cause was likely its formation outside of the solar system.
## Solution:
1. **Identify the conclusion:** Pluto is not a true planet.
2. **Analyze the reasoning:** The argument hinges on Pluto's formation and ejection from Neptune's orbit.
3. **Examine the answer choices:**
    * A is irrelevant, as the argument doesn't discuss moons becoming planets.
    * B is partially correct but doesn't address the formation aspect.
    * C focuses on the consequence of ejection, not the defining characteristic.
    * D is irrelevant, as the argument doesn't discuss size.
    * **E directly addresses the formation requirement, making it the key assumption.**
4. **Therefore, the correct answer is E.**
## Instructions for future similar problems:
1. **Focus on the core argument and its underlying assumptions, not just the immediate cause-and-effect relationships.**
2. **Carefully analyze each answer choice and its relation to the argument's logic.**
3. **Beware of logical fallacies and ensure your reasoning is sound.**
4. **Consider alternative explanations and potential counter-arguments.**
## General advice for similar problems:
* **Read the question and answer choices carefully.**
* **Identify the key issue and the underlying assumptions.**
* **Break down complex arguments into smaller, easier-to-analyze components.**
* **Apply relevant legal principles and concepts.**
* **Consider potential counter-arguments and strengthen your reasoning.**
* **Double-check your analysis and ensure your conclusion logically follows from the premises.**
