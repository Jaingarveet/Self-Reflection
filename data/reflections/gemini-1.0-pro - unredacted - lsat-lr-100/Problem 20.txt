**Error Keywords:**
* Overlooking relevant information
* Focusing on a single aspect of the problem
* Misunderstanding the relationship between national and local codes
**Solution:**
1. **Identify the relevant legal principles:**
    * National codes set minimum standards.
    * Local codes can be more stringent than national codes but not less stringent.
    * Ignorance of the law is not an excuse.
2. **Apply the principles to the facts:**
    * The defendant admits violating national building codes.
    * His excuse is based on confusion about which codes applied.
    * Regardless of his confusion, national codes still apply, and he is responsible for complying with them.
3. **Choose the answer that best reflects these principles:**
    * Option C accurately states that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. This means the defendant's noncompliance with national codes cannot be excused by his confusion about local codes.
