## Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect because I focused on the variability of individual allergies rather than the variability of cat proteins. While it's true that different people react to different proteins, the passage emphasizes that **not all cats have the same protein composition in their skin and saliva**. This directly implies that **cats themselves differ in their allergy-triggering potential**.
## Error Keywords:
* **Misinterpretation:** I misinterpreted the focus of the passage, emphasizing individual allergies instead of cat protein variability.
* **Overgeneralization:** I overgeneralized the statement about individual allergies to conclude that all cats are equally allergenic.
## Solution:
1. **Identify the key point:** The passage highlights the **variation in protein composition among cats**.
2. **Analyze the answer choices:** Only option C directly reflects this variation.
3. **Eliminate other options:**
    * A: This might be true, but the passage doesn't provide evidence.
    * B: While true, it's a weaker statement than C, which directly addresses the protein variation.
    * D: The passage doesn't discuss the intensity of reactions.
    * E: This is true due to individual differences, but not the main point.
## Instructions for Future:
1. **Focus on the main point of the passage, not just specific details.**
2. **Carefully analyze each answer choice and eliminate those that don't directly address the key point.**
3. **Consider the scope of the information provided and avoid making assumptions beyond the text.**
## General Advice:
* **Read the passage multiple times to ensure full comprehension.**
* **Identify the key issue or question being addressed.**
* **Analyze each answer choice critically and eliminate those that are irrelevant or contradict the information.**
* **Don't rush to answer; take your time to understand the context and implications.**
* **Be mindful of common logical fallacies and biases.**
