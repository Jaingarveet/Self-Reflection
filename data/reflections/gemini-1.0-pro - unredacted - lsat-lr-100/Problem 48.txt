Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption that the university president's argument relies on. I focused on the need to increase enrollment and overlooked the impact of reduced spending on the quality of education.
Error Keywords:
- Assumption identification error
- Causal relationship error
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The university president's argument is that if the university does not increase its enrollment, it will be forced to reduce spending. This reduction in spending will lead to a decline in the quality of education provided by the university. Therefore, the university must market its programs more aggressively in order to increase enrollment and avoid reducing spending.
The conclusion of the argument relies on the assumption that reducing spending will lead to a decline in the quality of education. This assumption is not explicitly stated in the argument, but it is implied by the president's statement that "we will be forced to reduce spending next year if we do not increase our enrollment."
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the argument and identify the conclusion.
2. Identify the premises that support the conclusion.
3. Determine which of the answer choices is an assumption that the argument relies on.
4. Choose the answer choice that correctly identifies the assumption.
Advice:
- Pay attention to the causal relationships between the premises and the conclusion.
- Consider the implications of the premises, even if they are not explicitly stated.
- Be aware of common assumptions that are often made in arguments.
- Choose the answer choice that most accurately reflects the assumption that the argument relies on.
