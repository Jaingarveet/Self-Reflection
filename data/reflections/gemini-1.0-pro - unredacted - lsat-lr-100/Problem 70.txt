## Reflection on Incorrect Answer:
My initial analysis focused on the subscriber's objection to the dubious assumption about government trustworthiness. However, I overlooked the crucial flaw in how the subscriber interpreted Arnot's argument. I mistakenly treated the subscriber's statement about "required changes" as equivalent to a claim of "guaranteed solutions." This led me to choose answer B, which highlights this misinterpretation.
## Error Keywords:
* Misinterpretation
* Overlooking crucial flaw
* Confusing necessary with sufficient
* Logical fallacy (correlation vs. causation)
## Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify Arnot's argument:** Making fundamental changes in government will virtually eliminate our most vexing social ills.
2. **Identify the subscriber's objection:** The conclusion is false because the argument depends on the dubious assumption that the government can be trusted to act in the public interest.
3. **Analyze the subscriber's reasoning:** The subscriber points out a weakness in the argument (dubious assumption) but then makes a logical leap by treating "required changes" as "guaranteed solutions."
4. **Identify the flaw:** The subscriber commits the fallacy of confusing correlation with causation. Just because changes are necessary doesn't mean they are sufficient to solve the problems.
5. **Choose the answer that reflects the identified flaw:** Answer A accurately captures the subscriber's flawed reasoning.
## Instructions for Future Problems:
1. Carefully read and understand the arguments presented.
2. Identify the key claims and assumptions of each argument.
3. Analyze the reasoning used to support the claims.
4. Look for logical fallacies or misinterpretations in the reasoning.
5. Choose the answer that most accurately reflects the identified flaw in reasoning.
## General Advice:
* Be mindful of the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.
* Avoid jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.
* Recognize and avoid common logical fallacies.
* Carefully consider the context and assumptions of the arguments being presented.
* Take your time and think critically before choosing an answer.
