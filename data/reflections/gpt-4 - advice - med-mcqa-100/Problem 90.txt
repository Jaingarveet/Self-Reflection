Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the medical condition being asked about.
- Don't make assumptions about the presence or absence of other symptoms unless this information is given in the question.
- Review each answer choice carefully and consider how it could potentially cause the condition.
- Remember that the most common cause of a condition may not always be the correct answer, especially if the question provides specific information about the patient's history or current situation.
