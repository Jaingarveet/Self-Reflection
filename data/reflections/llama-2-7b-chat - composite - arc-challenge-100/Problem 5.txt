Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. I incorrectly calculated the amount of sugar in the solution.

The correct calculation is:

10 grams of sugar dissolved in [REDACTED]rams of water = [REDACTED]rams of sugar-and-water solution

So, the correct answer is (C) [REDACTED]rams.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Mistake
* Incorrect calculation

Solution:

To find the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution, we need to use the fact that 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in [REDACTED]rams of water.

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in [REDACTED]rams of water.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution: 10 grams / [REDACTED]rams = 0.1 grams (or [REDACTED]rams)

Therefore, the amount of sugar in the sugar-and-water solution is [REDACTED]rams (C).

Instructions:

1. Identify the given information: 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in [REDACTED]rams of water.
2. Calculate the amount of sugar in the solution using the given information.
3. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the amount of sugar in the solution is directly proportional to the amount of sugar dissolved in the water.
