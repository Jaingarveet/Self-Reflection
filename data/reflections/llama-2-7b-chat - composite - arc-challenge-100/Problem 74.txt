Explanation:
I incorrectly identified [REDACTED] as a type of potential energy.

Error Keywords:

* Misclassification
* Confusion between potential and kinetic energy

Solution:
Thermal energy is actually a type of kinetic energy, as it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance.

Instructions:

1. Recognize that potential energy is energy that has the potential to do work, while kinetic energy is energy of motion.
2. Identify the correct type of energy for each option:
	* Sound energy is a type of kinetic energy (it is the energy of motion of particles in a substance).
	* Radiant energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work).
	* Chemical energy is a type of potential energy (it is energy that has the potential to do work through chemical reactions).
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your reasoning.

Advice:

* Always carefully read the question and understand the problem before answering.
* Use the correct terminology when classifying types of energy.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Remember that potential energy is energy that has the potential to do work, while kinetic energy is energy of motion.
