Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the property of a gas that allows all of the students to smell the food. I thought that a gas keeps its shape when placed in a container, but that is not the correct answer.

The correct answer is:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] gas takes the shape of its container.

When the teacher opens the can of food, the gas molecules inside the can are able to move freely and spread out into the surrounding air. Since the gas molecules are not attached to any particular shape, they are able to take on the shape of their container, which in this case is the classroom. As a result, the students are able to smell the food because the gas molecules from the food are able to reach their noses.
