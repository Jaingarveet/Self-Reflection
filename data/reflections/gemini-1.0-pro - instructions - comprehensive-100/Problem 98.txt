Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the amino acid in question.
2. Recall your knowledge of amino acid biosynthesis and post-translational modifications.
3. Determine if the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED] or formed by post-translational modification.
4. If the amino acid is directly translated from mRN[REDACTED], choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is required.
5. If the amino acid is formed by post-translational modification, choose the answer that indicates aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is not required.
6. Double-check your answer to ensure it aligns with your reasoning.
