Instructions:
1. Identify the two points that determine the line.
2. Calculate the slope of the line using the slope formula.
3. Set the slope equation equal to zero to find the value of $k$ that makes the slope undefined.
[REDACTED]. Check if the calculated value of $k$ is a valid solution by ensuring that it does not make the denominator of the slope equation zero.
5. If the calculated value of $k$ is not a valid solution, conclude that there is no value of $k$ that makes the slope of the line undefined.
