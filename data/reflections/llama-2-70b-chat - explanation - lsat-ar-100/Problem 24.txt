Explanation:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. This means that if Jaramillo is assigned to Venezuela, Yemen, or Zambia, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of those countries.

Option [REDACTED] states that [REDACTED] This means that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to the same ambassadorship. This has the same effect as the original constraint, as it ensures that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

The other options do not have the same effect as the original constraint:

Option [REDACTED] states that if Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo. This is not the same as the original constraint, as it does not ensure that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

Option [REDACTED] states that if Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke. This has no relation to the original constraint.

Option [REDACTED] states that if Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship. This is not the same as the original constraint, as it does not ensure that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

Option [REDACTED] states that [REDACTED] This is not the same as the original constraint, as it does not ensure that Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship whenever Jaramillo is assigned to one.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option [REDACTED].
