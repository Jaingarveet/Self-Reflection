Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the question and answered based on my own interpretation of the information provided.

The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

The reason for this is that the conditions set for the service targets do not allow for any client to have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, if one client has [REDACTED], the other clients' website targets must be shorter, and they cannot also have [REDACTED].
