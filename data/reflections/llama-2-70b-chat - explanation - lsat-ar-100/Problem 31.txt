Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions of the problem. I thought that the second batch of oatmeal cookies was made on the same day as the first batch of sugar cookies, rather than the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This led me to incorrectly determine the days on which the batches of each kind of cookie were made.
