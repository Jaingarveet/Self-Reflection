Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions provided. I thought that Parra and Quinn worked together in a sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall worked together in a sales zone, which led me to choose option [REDACTED]. However, upon re-reading the conditions, I realized that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, but not necessarily together.
