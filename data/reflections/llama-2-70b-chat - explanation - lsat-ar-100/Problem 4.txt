Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions. I assumed that if Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] cannot lead a Wednesday session. However, that is not necessarily true. Lan and [REDACTED] cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, but that does not mean they cannot both lead sessions on Wednesday.
