Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I failed to consider the impact of the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. This rule limits the assignment of a parking space for Young to only [REDACTED] possible spaces, #5 and #6. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED].
