Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions.
I assumed that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, which is not explicitly stated in the problem.
I also assumed that the two restaurants must be separated by exactly two other businesses, which is also not stated.
Furthermore, I did not consider the possibility that the veterinarian could be in space 5, which would affect the placement of the other businesses.
