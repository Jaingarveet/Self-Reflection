Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not fully consider the conditions stated in the problem. I focused on the fact that T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and I did not pay enough attention to the other conditions. Specifically, I did not ensure that at least two compositions were performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, and I did not ensure that O was performed either first or fifth.
