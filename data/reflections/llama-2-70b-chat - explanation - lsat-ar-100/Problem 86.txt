Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the type of cargo in bay 4 (produce) would determine the type of cargo in the adjacent bays. However, the information provided only establishes a partial ordering of the types of cargo, and it is possible for multiple bays to hold the same type of cargo.
