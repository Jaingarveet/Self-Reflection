Explanation:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the format required for answering the question.

The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

This answer choice does not violate any of the given requirements. The organizer can select up to four French works, and choosing one play and no Russian novels fits within that limit. Additionally, selecting one play and no Russian novels satisfies the condition that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.

Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.

Reflection:
I made a mistake in my previous response by not following the required format. In the future, I will ensure that I follow the format carefully and provide my answer in the correct way.

Additionally, I realized that I need to be more careful in my analysis of the question and the answer choices. I should have noticed that option [REDACTED] violates the rule that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.

In the future, I will take my time to carefully analyze the question, identify the key requirements, and evaluate each answer choice systematically to arrive at the correct answer.
