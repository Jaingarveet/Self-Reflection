Explanation:
I made a mistake in my previous answer. I misunderstood the condition that states "None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target." I thought it meant that the website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target for the same client, but it actually means that no client can have a website target that is longer than the voicemail target of any other client.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] must be 2 days. Given that Image's website target is 2 days, its voicemail target cannot be longer than 2 days. This satisfies the condition that no client can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
