Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and overlooked a critical detail in the question.
I correctly deduced that F must be selected if M is the only chemist selected, but I failed to consider the possibility that both G and H could be selected as botanists.
I also missed the fact that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which means that all three zoologists must be selected.
