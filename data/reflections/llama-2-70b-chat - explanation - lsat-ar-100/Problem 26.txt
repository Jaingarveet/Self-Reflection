Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. After reevaluating the problem, I realized that the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is indeed [REDACTED].

The conditions stated in the problem do not guarantee that Wayne will perform a traditional piece at all. It is possible that Wayne performs only modern pieces, while Zara performs both traditional and modern pieces. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
