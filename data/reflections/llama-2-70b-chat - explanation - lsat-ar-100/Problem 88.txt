Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my reasoning.
I incorrectly deduced that the top shelf had 2 books, the middle shelf had 3 books, and the bottom shelf had 3 books.
I also incorrectly deduced that K had to be on the top shelf and F had to be on the middle or bottom shelf.
I further incorrectly deduced that O had to be on the top or middle shelf and L had to be on the bottom shelf.
I also incorrectly deduced that F and M had to be on the middle or bottom shelf together.
