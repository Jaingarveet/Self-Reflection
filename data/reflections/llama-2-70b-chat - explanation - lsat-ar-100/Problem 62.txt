Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and incorrect assumptions.
I assumed that if Kayne is assigned to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to Yemen, which is incorrect.
I also assumed that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Kayne, which is also incorrect.
Furthermore, I failed to consider all possible scenarios and did not check my answer against all the given constraints.
