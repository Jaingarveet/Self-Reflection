Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning by not considering all possible scenarios. 
I incorrectly assumed that Young must be assigned parking space #2, which led me to choose answer [REDACTED]. 
However, Young could have been assigned parking space #1, which would have allowed Souza to be assigned parking space #4.
