Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the constraint that Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. I thought it meant that they had to lead sessions on different days, but it actually means that they cannot lead sessions that meet at the same time (i.e., both morning or both afternoon sessions).
