Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I correctly identified that if both G and H are selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist. However, I incorrectly concluded that the panel must include either M or Q. In reality, if both G and H are selected, then the panel must include either F or K, as they are the only remaining scientists of the three types.
