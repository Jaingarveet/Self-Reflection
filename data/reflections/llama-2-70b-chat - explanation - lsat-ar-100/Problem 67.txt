Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the conditions given in the problem. I thought that the second batch of oatmeal cookies had to be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies had to be made on Thursday. However, the problem only states that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, but it does not specify that these batches have to be made on consecutive days.
