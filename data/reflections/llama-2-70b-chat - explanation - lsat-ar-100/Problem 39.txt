Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and overlooked a critical detail in the question.
The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED], one Russian play.
I incorrectly assumed that if both French plays are selected, the Russian play cannot be selected.
However, the question states that "if both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected."
Therefore, option [REDACTED] meets all the requirements and is the correct answer.
