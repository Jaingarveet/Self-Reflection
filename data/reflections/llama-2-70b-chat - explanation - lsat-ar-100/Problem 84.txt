Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the given information.
I mistakenly believed that the bottom shelf must have more books than the top shelf, and therefore, it cannot be empty.
However, the question only states that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, which means that the bottom shelf can still have fewer books than the middle shelf.
