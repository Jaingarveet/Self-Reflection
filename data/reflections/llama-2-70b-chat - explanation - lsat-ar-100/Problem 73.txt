Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made an error in my reasoning. I assumed that if exactly three students review Undulation, then we can list them as U1, U2, and U3, and use the given information to deduce their identities. However, I failed to consider the possibility that the three students who review Undulation may not be distinct.
