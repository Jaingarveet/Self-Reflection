Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition that states "S can be earlier than Q only if [REDACTED]."
I thought it meant that S had to be earlier than Q, which led me to choose [REDACTED].
However, the correct interpretation is that S can be earlier than Q only if [REDACTED], which means Q can be second or third.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as [REDACTED]
