Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of atomic mass.

Error Keywords:
 - Conceptual error
 - Atomic mass error
 - Proton and neutron error

Solution:
The mass of an atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, as electrons have negligible mass.
In this case, the atom has [REDACTED] protons and [REDACTED] neutrons.
The mass of the atom is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons.
The sum of [REDACTED] protons and [REDACTED] neutrons is [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the number of protons in the atom.
2. Identify the number of neutrons in the atom.
3. Add the number of protons and neutrons together.
4. Ignore the number of electrons, as they have negligible mass.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the mass of an atom is determined by the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, not the number of electrons.
