Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all of the remaining answer choices ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], and E) satisfied the given constraints. However, I overlooked that in choices [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], the toy store is adjacent to the veterinarian, violating the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Only choice [REDACTED] satisfies all of the given constraints.
