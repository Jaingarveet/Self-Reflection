Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the placement of the books on the shelves. Specifically, I incorrectly assumed that since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be 2 books on the top, 2-3 in the middle, and 3-4 on the bottom. However, this distribution is not the only possibility that satisfies the given conditions. My reasoning led me to incorrectly eliminate answer choice [REDACTED].
