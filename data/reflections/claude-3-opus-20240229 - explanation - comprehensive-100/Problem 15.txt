Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on finding a choice that directly contradicted the expert opinion about cattle and sheep trampling. While choice [REDACTED] does suggest the salamanders avoid trampling, it doesn't provide a compelling alternative explanation for the population decline. I overlooked the significance of choice [REDACTED], which points to decreased rainfall and lower groundwater levels affecting the salamanders' habitat. This offers a plausible contributing factor separate from the trampling issue.
