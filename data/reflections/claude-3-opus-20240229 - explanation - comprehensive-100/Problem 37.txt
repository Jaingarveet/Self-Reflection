Explanation:
I focused too much on the variability in allergic reactions between individuals, and not enough on the variability in the proteins produced by different cats. While the passage does strongly support that no cat causes allergies in all people, upon re-reading, it also directly states that the particular proteins responsible for allergies vary from person to person. This implies that cats must differ in the specific proteins they produce.
