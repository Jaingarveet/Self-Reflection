Explanation:
I incorrectly attributed the root canal isthmus classification to [REDACTED], who described the anatomy of the pulp chamber floor. However, the question specifically asked about the isthmus classification, which was given by [REDACTED]. I confused the pulp chamber floor anatomy with the isthmus classification.
