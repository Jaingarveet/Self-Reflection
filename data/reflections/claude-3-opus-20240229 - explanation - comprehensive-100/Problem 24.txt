Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the constraints on Nina's report. I incorrectly concluded that if Nina gives a report, it must be on Wednesday. However, the question states that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina could give a report on Monday or Wednesday, but not Tuesday.
