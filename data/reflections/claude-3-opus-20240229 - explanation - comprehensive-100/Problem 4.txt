Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the length of the space shuttle. I correctly calculated the speed of the shuttle, but I made a mistake in the final step when calculating the length. I multiplied the speed by the time it takes to pass a point, but this is incorrect. The correct approach is to divide the distance traveled in the given time by the time taken to pass a point.
