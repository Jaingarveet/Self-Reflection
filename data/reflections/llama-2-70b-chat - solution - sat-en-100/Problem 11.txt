Solution:
The table shows that 100% of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by at least one of the four pathogens (Viruses, IAPV, KBV, and Fungi).

Furthermore, the table shows that 77% of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by Nosema apis, and 100% were infected by either Nosema apis or Nosema ceranae (since 100% - 77% = 23%).

Therefore, the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens is:

100% (at least one of the four pathogens) x 77% (Nosema apis) x 100% (either Nosema apis or Nosema ceranae) = 100%
