Solution:
Lincoln's argument in Passage 2 suggests that the controversy over slavery is caused by efforts to spread it into new territory, and that limiting it to its present bounds would lead to peace. Therefore, he would likely agree that abandoning attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced would abate the controversy.
