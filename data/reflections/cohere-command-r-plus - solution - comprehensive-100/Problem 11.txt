Solution:
To cast doubt on the assertion that rising land prices are the chief reason for soaring housing prices, we should look for evidence that housing prices can rise independently of land prices, or that other factors may play a more significant role. 

Choice [REDACTED] shows that in Shanghai, housing prices rose more sharply than land prices, but both still increased. This weakens the argument to some extent, but it does not directly contradict the assertion. 

Choice [REDACTED] presents a scenario where Beijing's residential prices increased while land prices remained almost unchanged, rising by only 0.37%. This directly contradicts the assertion and is the most effective at casting doubt on the claim. 

Choice [REDACTED] supports the assertion, as it states that increasing land development costs will lead to higher house prices. 

Choice [REDACTED] provides an alternative explanation for soaring housing prices, but it does not address the role of land prices and therefore does not directly refute the assertion.
