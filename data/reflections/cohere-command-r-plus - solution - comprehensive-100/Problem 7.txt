Solution:
The average of the 10 vehicles' weights is $12.2$ tons, so their total weight is $10 \times 12.2 = 122$ tons. After adding the new truck, the average weight increased to $12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8$ tons, and the total weight increased to $14.8 \times 11 = 162.8$ tons. The weight of the new heavy-duty truck is $162.8 - 122 = \mathbf{[REDACTED]}$ tons.
