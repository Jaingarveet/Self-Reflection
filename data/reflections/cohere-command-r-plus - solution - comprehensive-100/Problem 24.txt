Solution:

We are given the condition that if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. 

If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. 

Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, and it must be in the morning as Robert and Olivia cannot give afternoon reports. 

If Nina gives her report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This leaves only Robert and Olivia for the Wednesday morning report. 

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
