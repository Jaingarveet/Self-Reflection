Solution:
The line passes through the points (2, k) and (k, 32). For this line to also pass through the origin ([REDACTED], [REDACTED]), either the $x$ or $y$ coordinate of one of the given points must be zero. Setting $k=[REDACTED]$, we get the points (2, [REDACTED]) and ([REDACTED], 32). Thus, $k$ can be [REDACTED], and the correct answer is [REDACTED].
