Solution:
The provided statements describe two types of horror stories: those featuring mad scientists and those featuring monstrous beasts. Both types share two common features: they violate the laws of nature and evoke dread in readers.

Option [REDACTED] states: "[REDACTED]"
This option is the correct answer because it is the only one that captures the partial truth reflected in the statements. While not all horror stories employ symbolism, the statements indicate that some stories within these two subtypes do violate the laws of nature.

The other options make broader generalizations that are not supported by the provided information. They either refer to "all" stories or make assertions about the intentions or content of all stories within a specific type, which goes beyond the scope of the given statements.
