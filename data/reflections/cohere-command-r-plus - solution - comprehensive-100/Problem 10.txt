Solution:
The total amount to be distributed is Rs. 8600, and there are 11 family members in total: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. 

Step 1: Calculate the number of family members: 
Total family members = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. 

Step 2: Find the share for each nephew: 
Nephew's share = Total amount / Total family members = Rs. 8600 / 11 = Rs. 781.82 (rounded to two decimal places). 

Step 3: Calculate the share for each daughter, which is four times the nephew's share: 
Daughter's share = 4 * Nephew's share = 4 * Rs. 781.82 = Rs. 3127.28. 

Step 4: Check the answer options: 
Option [REDACTED] offers the closest rounded value to our calculated result, so the final answer is [REDACTED].
