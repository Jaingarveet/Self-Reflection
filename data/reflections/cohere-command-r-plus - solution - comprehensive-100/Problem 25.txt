Solution:
Step 1: Start by placing the pharmacy at one end, as per the constraints. We can choose to place it in space 1 or space 7. Let's choose space 1 for now. 

Step 2: The other end must be occupied by one of the restaurants. Place one restaurant in space 7. 

Step 3: The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Let's place the optometrist in space 2, next to the pharmacy. 

Step 4: The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Place the toy store in space 3, next to the optometrist. 

Step 5: We now have the veterinarian, the second restaurant, and the shoe store left to place. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Place the veterinarian in space 4, next to the toy store. 

Step 6: The shoe store can now be placed in space 5. 

Step 7: Finally, the second restaurant goes in space 6. 

The final order is: pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, veterinarian, shoe store, restaurant, restaurant. This matches choice [REDACTED].
