Solution:

The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target longer than their voicemail target. This immediately rules out choice [REDACTED], as [REDACTED] would violate this condition for all clients.

Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients, so it must be set at 1 day. This means that Image's website target should be set at 2 days to satisfy the condition that the website target cannot be longer than the voicemail target.

Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's. If we set Solide's website target at 2 days, we can set Truvest's website target at 3 days, satisfying the condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
