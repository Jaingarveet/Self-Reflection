Solution:
The shuttle's speed = distance/time = 700m/40s = 17.5 m/s. This is its vertical speed. 

However, to find the length of the shuttle, we need to use a different calculation. The shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so we can find its length by using this formula: 
Length = distance/time = 700m/5s = 140m 

The length of the shuttle is 140 meters, which matches choice [REDACTED].
