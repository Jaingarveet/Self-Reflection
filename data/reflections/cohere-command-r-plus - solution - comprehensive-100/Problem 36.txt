Solution:
The editorial draws an analogy between painting and education, emphasizing the sequential nature of both processes. Each layer in painting, like each step in education, builds upon the previous one. The argument suggests that just as the success of a painting depends on the initial preparation, the overall educational experience's success depends primarily on the student's initial educational experience. 

Choice [REDACTED] completes the argument by explicitly making this connection between the initial educational experience and the overall outcome, mirroring the relationship between surface preparation and the final result in painting.
