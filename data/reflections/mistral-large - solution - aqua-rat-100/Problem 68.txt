Solution:
The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11.
One of the integers is 350.
Since 11 is a prime number, the other integer must also be divisible by 11.
The least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700.
Since 7700 = 11 x 700, the other integer must be a factor of 7700.
Let's check each of the answer choices to see which one is a factor of 7700 and is also divisible by 11.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] is divisible by 11, and it is a factor of 7700 (7700 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7 x 11 x 11).
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] is divisible by 11, but it is not a factor of 7700.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] is not divisible by 11, so it cannot be the other integer.
