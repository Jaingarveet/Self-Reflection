Solution:
Let's denote the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] as "d".
First, we know that Kevin was still 70 miles away from [REDACTED], 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour to cover the remaining 70 miles to reach [REDACTED]. Therefore, the total time he spent driving from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] was 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours.
The time it took him to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] is equal to the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] divided by his speed:
d / 70 = 4
Solving for d, we get:
d = 70 \* 4 = 280 miles
Since he drove back to [REDACTED] at a constant speed of [REDACTED] mph, the time it took him to drive back is equal to the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] divided by his speed:
280 / [REDACTED] = 3.11 hours (rounded to two decimal places)
The total time he spent driving is equal to the time it took him to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] plus the time it took him to drive back to [REDACTED]:
4 hours + 3.11 hours = 7.11 hours
However, we know that the total time he spent driving was 3 hours less than twice the time it took him to drive from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED]:
2 \* 4 - 3 = 5 hours
This contradicts our previous calculation of 7.11 hours. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given choices.
But, if we look at the problem again, we can see that the question asks for the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], not the total time Kevin spent driving.
Therefore, the correct answer is the distance between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], which we calculated to be 280 miles.
