Solution:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression ([REDACTED].P.) with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the [REDACTED].P. is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is [REDACTED]0 years.
To find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
Sum = n * (2a + (n - 1) * d) / 2
where Sum is the sum of the ages ([REDACTED]0), a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (1/4), and n is the number of terms (members).
We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:
n = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)
Substituting the given values:
n = ([REDACTED]0 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
We can simplify and solve for n:
n = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
n = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)
n = 500 / (13 + n/4)
4n = [REDACTED]00 / (13 + n/4)
4n(13 + n/4) = [REDACTED]00
52n + n^2 = [REDACTED]00
n^2 + 52n - [REDACTED]00 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation:
(n - [REDACTED])(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are [REDACTED] and -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members is [REDACTED].
