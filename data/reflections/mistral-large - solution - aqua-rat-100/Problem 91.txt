Solution:
[REDACTED] travels [REDACTED] south, then [REDACTED] east, then [REDACTED] north, and finally [REDACTED] west.
To find the distance from home, we can use the concept of displacement.
Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions of an object.
In this case, the displacement is the distance between the starting point and the ending point.
Since [REDACTED] travels [REDACTED] south and then [REDACTED] north, these two distances cancel each other out, leaving [REDACTED] at the same north-south position as the starting point.
Since [REDACTED] travels [REDACTED] east and then [REDACTED] west, these two distances partially cancel each other out, leaving [REDACTED] [REDACTED] east of the starting point.
Therefore, the distance from home is [REDACTED].
