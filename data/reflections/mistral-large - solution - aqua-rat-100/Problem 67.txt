Solution:
Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls.
Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes do.
Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as how many pita breads?

The ratio of pita breads to rolls is 6:[REDACTED] or simplified to [REDACTED]:1.
The ratio of rolls to baguettes is [REDACTED]:5.

To compare pita breads to baguettes, we need to find a common factor between rolls and pita breads.
We can multiply the first ratio by [REDACTED] and the second ratio by 1 to get the same number of rolls:
([REDACTED]:1) x [REDACTED] = 9:[REDACTED]
([REDACTED]:5) x 1 = [REDACTED]:5

Now we can compare pita breads to baguettes:
9 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] rolls, and [REDACTED] rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.
Therefore, 9 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.

To find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] baguettes, we can set up a proportion:
9/5 = x/[REDACTED]

Cross-multiplying, we get:
5x = 18
x = 18/5 = [REDACTED].6

Since we cannot have a fraction of a pita bread, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is [REDACTED].
