Solution:
The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, so they will arrive at the station at the same time every 10 minutes.
The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 [REDACTED].M., which means that the harbor line train will arrive 2 minutes after the main line train.
Since the frequency is 10 minutes, the man will have to wait for either 2 minutes or 8 minutes for the next train.
The probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time he waits for the first train to the total time between the arrival of two consecutive trains.
The probability of catching the main line train is 2/10 = 0.2, and the probability of catching the harbor line train is 8/10 = [REDACTED].
The total probability of catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of catching either train, which is 0.2 + [REDACTED] = 1.
However, since the man can only catch one train, the probability of catching the first train is the probability of catching the train that arrives first.
The harbor line train arrives 2 minutes after the main line train, so the probability of catching the first train is the probability of catching the main line train, which is 0.2.
