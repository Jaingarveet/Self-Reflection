Solution:
The amount of work done is proportional to the number of workers and the number of hours worked per day, and inversely proportional to the number of days taken to complete the work.
Let's denote the amount of work done by W.
Then, we have the equation:
W = (number of workers) x (hours worked per day) x (number of days)
Using this equation, we can find the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days:
W1 = x x x x x = x^3
Similarly, we can find the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days:
W2 = y x y x y = y^3
The question asks for the ratio of W2 to W1, which is:
W2/W1 = y^3 / x^3
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: y^3 / x^2
