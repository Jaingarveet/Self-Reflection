Solution:
The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 4:2.5.
The new ratio of boys to girls is 4:3.
Let x be the number of boys and girls who joined the group.
Since the same number of boys and girls joined the group, the number of boys who joined is x and the number of girls who joined is also x.
The new number of boys is 64 + x and the new number of girls is 40 + x.
The new ratio can be written as (64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3.
Solving for x, we get x = 24.
So, 24 boys and 24 girls joined the group.
The total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 24 + 24 = [REDACTED].
