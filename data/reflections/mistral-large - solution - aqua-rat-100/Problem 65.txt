Solution:
Let's denote the 5-digit number as ABCD[REDACTED].
According to the given property, ABCDE1 = 3 \* 1ABCD[REDACTED].

First, let's analyze the right side of the equation:
1ABCD[REDACTED] is equal to 100000 \* [REDACTED] + 10000 \* [REDACTED] + 1000 \* [REDACTED] + 100 \* [REDACTED] + 10 \* [REDACTED] + 1.

Now, let's analyze the left side of the equation:
ABCDE1 is equal to 10000 \* [REDACTED] + 1000 \* [REDACTED] + 100 \* [REDACTED] + 10 \* [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] + 1.

Comparing both sides, we can see that:
100000 \* [REDACTED] + 10000 \* [REDACTED] + 1000 \* [REDACTED] + 100 \* [REDACTED] + 10 \* [REDACTED] + 1 = 3 \* (10000 \* [REDACTED] + 1000 \* [REDACTED] + 100 \* [REDACTED] + 10 \* [REDACTED] + [REDACTED] + 1).

Simplifying the equation, we get:
70000 \* [REDACTED] + 7000 \* [REDACTED] + 700 \* [REDACTED] + 70 \* [REDACTED] + 7 \* [REDACTED] = 2.

Since all the coefficients on the left side are multiples of 7, the number must be divisible by 7.

Now, let's check the given options:
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] -> 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 26, not divisible by 7.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] -> 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20, not divisible by 7.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] -> 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 23, not divisible by 7.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] -> 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 24, divisible by 7.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] -> 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 24, divisible by 7.

However, we need to check if the given property holds true for the remaining options.

For option [REDACTED]:
[REDACTED]1 = 3 \* 1[REDACTED] -> [REDACTED]1 = 373701, which is false.

For option [REDACTED]:
[REDACTED]1 = 3 \* 1[REDACTED] -> [REDACTED]1 = 430698, which is false.

Therefore, none of the given options satisfies the given property.
