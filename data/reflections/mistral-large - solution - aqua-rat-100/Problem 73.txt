Solution:
To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both percentages.
20% of the students took physics, so the number of students must be a multiple of 5 (since 20% is equivalent to 1/5).
28% of the students took math, so the number of students must be a multiple of 7 (since 28% is equivalent to 2/7).
The smallest number that is a multiple of both 5 and 7 is 35.
However, the question states that there are more than 501 students in the school.
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 525 (which is a multiple of both 5 and 7 and greater than 501).
