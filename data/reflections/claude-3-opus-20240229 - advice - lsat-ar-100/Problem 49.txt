Advice:
 - Always read the question and constraints multiple times to ensure full understanding.
 - Consider each constraint separately and methodically apply it to each answer choice.
 - Be careful not to misinterpret a constraint or eliminate a choice that actually satisfies all constraints.
 - If multiple choices satisfy all constraints, consider if the question is asking for all possibilities or just one.
 - In problems with complex rules or arrangements, consider drawing diagrams to visualize the possibilities.
