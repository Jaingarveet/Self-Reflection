Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand all the constraints and conditions.
 - Consider each condition independently and its implications before trying to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.
 - Break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
 - Systematically evaluate each answer choice against the conditions, eliminating those that violate any condition.
 - Don't overconstraint the problem by assuming additional restrictions that are not stated in the question.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which one fits all the conditions.
