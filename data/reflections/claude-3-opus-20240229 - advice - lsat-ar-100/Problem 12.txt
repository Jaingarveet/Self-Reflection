Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify all given constraints.
 - Always consider the implications of each individual constraint.
 - Always think through the possible positions or orders for each element.
 - Always methodically consider each answer choice against the constraints.
 - Remember that "cannot be consecutive" means there is no possible order where the elements are next to each other.
 - If the constraints on two elements prevent them from ever being consecutive, then that is likely the correct answer.
