Advice:
 - Always consider all possibilities that satisfy the stated constraints.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that overly constrain the possibilities.
 - Systematically evaluate each possibility against the constraints.
 - Clearly differentiate between what must be true, what could be true, and what cannot be true.
 - Rely only on the information given and logically derived from the given constraints.
