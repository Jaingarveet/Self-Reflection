Advice:
 - Always carefully read and understand all given constraints before attempting to solve the problem.
 - Consider each constraint individually and in combination with others.
 - Methodically test each answer choice against the constraints.
 - Remember that for this type of "CANNOT be true" question, you are looking for the choice that is impossible given the constraints.
 - If a choice seems impossible, try to prove it by showing how it violates a constraint.
 - If a choice seems possible, try to disprove it by finding a scenario where it satisfies all constraints.
 - Take your time, be thorough, and double-check your logic before finalizing your answer.
