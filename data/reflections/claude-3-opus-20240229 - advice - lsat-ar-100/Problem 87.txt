Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand what it is asking for.
 - Focus on identifying necessary conditions that must be true in all valid scenarios, rather than getting caught up in constructing specific scenarios.
 - Analyze each constraint separately to determine what it implies must be true in all cases.
 - Remember that a statement is only necessarily true if it holds in all possible scenarios that satisfy the given constraints.
 - Avoid overspecifying the problem by adding unwarranted assumptions or details.
 - If you're unsure, try to disprove an answer choice by constructing a counterexample scenario where it doesn't hold.
