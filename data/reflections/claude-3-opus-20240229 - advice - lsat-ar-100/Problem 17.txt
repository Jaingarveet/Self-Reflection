Advice:
 - Always read the constraints carefully and consider their implications.
 - Don't focus on a single arrangement; consider multiple possibilities.
 - Systematically analyze each constraint and its logical consequences.
 - Consider the specific question being asked and how the constraints relate to it.
 - Eliminate answer choices that could be true; select the one that must be false.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices.
