Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify all explicit and implicit constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically, eliminating choices that violate constraints.
 - Never select an answer without checking that it satisfies all constraints.
 - Always watch out for implicit constraints that arise from combining explicit constraints.
 - Remember that "higher-numbered than" is a transitive relationship: if [REDACTED] is higher than [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] is higher than [REDACTED], then [REDACTED] must also be higher than [REDACTED].
