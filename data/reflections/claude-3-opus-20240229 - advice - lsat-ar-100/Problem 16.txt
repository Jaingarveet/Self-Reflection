Advice:
 - Always read each constraint multiple times to ensure full understanding. 
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that add restrictions beyond those stated.
 - Eliminate answer choices one constraint at a time to organize your reasoning.
 - For constraints with relative terms, consider alternate interpretations beyond the strictest one.
 - Don't stop evaluating an answer choice just because it satisfies most constraints; it must satisfy all.
 - If you eliminate an answer choice, don't second-guess yourself without strong justification.
