Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the given constraints.
 - Be careful not to make any assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - When dealing with multiple constraints, start with the most restrictive ones and work your way down.
 - Consider each constraint separately and in combination with others to ensure no conflicts arise.
 - If you reach a contradiction, don't be afraid to backtrack and reconsider previous steps.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure that your conclusion follows logically from the given constraints.
