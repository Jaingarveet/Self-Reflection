Advice:
 - Always carefully read and identify all scheduling conditions and restrictions.
 - Always consider conditional restrictions and how one person's scheduled slot impacts others.
 - Work through the schedule systematically, filling in the most restricted slots first.
 - Continually check the evolving schedule against the conditions to ensure validity.
 - If a condition is violated, backtrack and revise the schedule until all conditions are met.
 - Double-check the final schedule against all conditions before finalizing your answer.
