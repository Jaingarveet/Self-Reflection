Advice:
 - Always consider all possible scenarios before concluding that something is impossible.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not certain conclusions based on the given information.
 - If a question asks what must be true, look for the answer choice that is true in all possible scenarios.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences beyond what the information strictly implies.
 - In scheduling problems, start with the most constrained elements and work towards the less constrained ones.
