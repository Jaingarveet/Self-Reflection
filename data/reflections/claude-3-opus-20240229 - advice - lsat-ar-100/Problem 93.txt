Advice:
 - Always fully consider the implications of all given conditions and constraints.
 - Be thorough in evaluating each answer choice against all conditions.
 - If a choice seems possible, double-check it against each condition to be sure.
 - Look for implicit implications of the conditions that might not be immediately obvious.
 - Don't select an answer until you've confirmed it fully satisfies all conditions.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices, seeing which could be possible and which are definitively impossible.
