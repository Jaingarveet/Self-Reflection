Advice:
 - Always consider all the possibilities, not just the ones mentioned in the answer choices.
 - Don't over-constrain the problem by assuming things that are not explicitly stated.
 - Eliminate answer choices by contradiction - if an answer choice necessarily leads to a violation of a condition, it cannot be correct.
 - If a condition states an inequality, consider the boundary case (e.g., if Zone 3 must have more than Zone 2, consider the case where Zone 2 has the maximum possible).
 - Be systematic in your reasoning and consider each condition and each answer choice thoroughly.
