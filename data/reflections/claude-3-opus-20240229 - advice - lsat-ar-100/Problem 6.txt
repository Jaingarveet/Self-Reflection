Advice:
 - Always consider the big picture and total quantities involved, not just specific details.
 - Look for implied information and necessary conclusions, not just explicitly stated facts.
 - Eliminate answer choices methodically based on your deductions.
 - If an answer choice contains an absolute statement (e.g., "must be true"), look for any possible counterexample that disproves it.
 - Reread the question and answers carefully to ensure you are selecting an answer that is definitely true, not just possibly true.
