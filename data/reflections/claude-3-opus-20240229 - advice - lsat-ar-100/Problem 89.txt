Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all conditions and constraints.
 - Always consider how the fixed or known events limit the possibilities for the unknown events.
 - Systematically evaluate each answer choice against all conditions, eliminating those that violate any condition.
 - If multiple choices seem possible, re-check each one carefully against all conditions to identify the correct answer.
 - Don't make assumptions; reason only from the given information and conditions.
