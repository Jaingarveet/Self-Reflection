Advice:
 - Always carefully read and re-read the question and constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically.
 - Always try to construct concrete scenarios to test each answer choice.
 - Never assume an answer is impossible until you have thoroughly tried to find a valid scenario.
 - Always double-check that your chosen scenario satisfies all the given constraints.
 - Remember that for "could be true" questions, you only need to find one possible valid scenario.
