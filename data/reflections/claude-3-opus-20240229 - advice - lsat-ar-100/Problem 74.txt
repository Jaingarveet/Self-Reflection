Advice:
 - Always consider the implications of each constraint both individually and in combination with others.
 - Be sure to consider both what must be true and what cannot be true based on the constraints.
 - Eliminate answer choices as soon as you determine they are not possible based on the constraints.
 - Be methodical and thorough in your reasoning, considering all possible scenarios.
 - If you're unsure, try working through the problem from a different starting point or assumption.
