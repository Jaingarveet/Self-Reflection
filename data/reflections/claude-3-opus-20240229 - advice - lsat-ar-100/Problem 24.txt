Advice:
 - Always read constraints carefully and consider their full logical implications.
 - Be wary of contrapositives - they are not always logically equivalent in meaning.
 - Eliminate irrelevant answer choices first.
 - Always consider how each answer choice relates to and affects the original constraint.
 - Select the answer that most fully captures the meaning and effect of the original, without adding or removing implications.
