Advice:
 - Always carefully read and consider all conditions and constraints given in the question.
 - Break down complex conditions into individual requirements and analyze each one separately.
 - Use process of elimination to rule out definitively incorrect answer choices.
 - Consider each remaining answer choice individually and test it against all given conditions.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that add constraints beyond those explicitly given.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices to see which one(s) could satisfy the conditions.
