Advice:
 - In constraint satisfaction problems, always consider the most restrictive conditions first.
 - Mentally simulate the schedule chronologically, assigning roles one at a time.
 - At each step, check if any constraints are violated before proceeding.
 - If a partial assignment leads to an irreconcilable conflict, backtrack and consider a different assignment.
 - Be sure to consider all constraints for each possible choice before deciding if it can be true or not.
 - Don't rush to judgment; carefully reason through each choice step-by-step.
