Advice:
- Always consider all possibilities consistent with the given constraints.
- Be careful not to make unsupported assumptions or jump to conclusions.
- Eliminate answer choices that are impossible or inconsistent with the constraints.
- Remember that "could be true" means possible under some scenario, not necessarily true in all scenarios.
- If multiple possibilities remain, look for the answer choice that holds under at least one of them.
