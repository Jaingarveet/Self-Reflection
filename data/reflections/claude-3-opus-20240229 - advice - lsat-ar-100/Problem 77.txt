Advice:
 - Always read the constraints and rules carefully.
 - Consider the implications of each rule - how it affects the possibilities for each individual.
 - Recognize that constraints on one individual can lead to further constraints on others.
 - Be thorough in working through the implications of each rule until no further inferences can be made.
 - Organize your final results clearly before answering the question.
 - Double-check your work if time allows.
