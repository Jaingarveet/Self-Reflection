Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all given constraints and fixed events.
 - Consider the logical implications of each piece of information on the other variables.
 - Eliminate possibilities that directly violate the stated constraints.
 - Analyze each answer choice individually rather than assuming one must be correct.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that lead to constraint violations.
 - If stuck, try working through the scheduling possibilities day by day.
