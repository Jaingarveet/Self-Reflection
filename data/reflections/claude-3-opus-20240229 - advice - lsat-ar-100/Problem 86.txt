Advice:
 - Always carefully read and consider all given information in a problem.
 - Break the problem down into steps, applying each piece of information or constraint one at a time.
 - Consider the implications of each piece of information fully before moving on.
 - If you're able to narrow something down to a few options, don't stop there - see if the remaining constraints allow you to make a definitive determination.
 - Be thorough in your analysis and don't stop reasoning prematurely.
 - If the question asks for a count or a specific answer, make sure your final response directly addresses that.
