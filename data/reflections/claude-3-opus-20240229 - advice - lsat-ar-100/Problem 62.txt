Advice:
 - Always read the question and constraints very carefully.
 - Break down complex scenarios into individual facts and constraints. 
 - Consider each constraint separately and apply them methodically.
 - Use deductive reasoning to draw new conclusions from the given information.
 - Eliminate possibilities that violate any of the constraints.
 - Continue this process until you arrive at the one and only possibility that must be true.
 - If you get stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices.
