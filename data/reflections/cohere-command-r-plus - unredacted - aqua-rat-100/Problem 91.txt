Explanation: 
I incorrectly applied Pythagoras' theorem to find the distance. The east-west and south-north displacements are not perpendicular, and the former is not the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The correct approach is to consider the net displacement in each direction.

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect theorem application
- Geometry error

Solution: 
A travels 3 km south, 5 km east, 3 km north, and 2 km west. The net displacement to the south and north cancels out, leaving A 3 km to the east and 2 km to the north of the starting point. These displacements are not perpendicular, so we calculate them separately. Thus, A is 3 km away from home.

Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: A travels in different directions and wants to know the final distance from home.
2. Identify the net displacement in each direction: south-north cancels out, leaving 3 km east and 2 km north.
3. Recognize that the east-west and south-north displacements are independent and not perpendicular.
4. Calculate the distance for each direction separately: 3 km east and 2 km north from the starting point.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated distance from home.

Advice:
- Understand the geometry of the problem and the directions involved.
- Recognize that displacements in different directions may not always result in a right triangle.
- Calculate net displacements separately for each direction.
- Be cautious when applying mathematical theorems and ensure their conditions are met.
