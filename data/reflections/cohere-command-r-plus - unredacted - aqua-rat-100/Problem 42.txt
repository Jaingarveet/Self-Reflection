Explanation: 
I correctly calculated the total length of the fence in inches, but I made a mistake in converting it to feet. I divided by 12 instead of multiplying by 1/12 or 0.5 feet. This is a simple unit conversion error.

- Unit conversion error
- Calculation error
- Simplification error

Solution: 
Each picket plus the space is 6.5 inches. 
The total length of the fence is (6+1/2)x inches = 13/2*x inches.
To convert this to feet, we multiply by 1/12 or simplify and multiply by 0.5 feet.
So, the answer is (13x/2)*0.5 feet, which simplifies to (13x-12)/24 feet.

Instructions:
1. Calculate the total length of the fence in inches.
2. Identify that you need to convert this length to feet.
3. Know that converting inches to feet requires multiplying by 1/12 or 0.5.
4. Perform the unit conversion correctly.
5. Simplify the final expression.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully to identify the required units.
- Understand the problem and identify any necessary unit conversions.
- Know the basic unit conversions, such as inches to feet (1/12 or 0.5).
- Double-check your calculations and unit conversions.
- Simplify expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.
