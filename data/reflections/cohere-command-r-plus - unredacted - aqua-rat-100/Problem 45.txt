Explanation: I incorrectly set up the equation to calculate the marked price of the sewing machine. I forgot to account for the 20% profit that Karan wanted to make, which resulted in an incorrect value for the marked price. My calculation skills were lacking, and I made a mistake in solving the equation.

Error Keywords:
- Equation setup error
- Profit calculation error
- Arithmetic error

Solution: 
Cost price = Rs. 1200
Desired profit % = 20%
Discount offered = 20%

Let the marked price of the sewing machine be Rs. x

To make a 20% profit, Karan should sell the machine for 120% of its cost price: 
1200 * 120/100 = Rs. 1440

Now, we calculate the price after a 20% discount: 
1440 * 80/100 = Rs. 1152

So, the marked price, Rs. x, should be set to Rs. 1440 to achieve a 20% profit, and even after offering a 20% discount, he will sell the machine for Rs. 1152.

Therefore, the correct answer is E: Rs. 1,800

Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: Karan wants to mark up the price of a sewing machine to make a 20% profit, even after offering a 20% discount.
2. Calculate the price after the desired profit: Multiply the cost price by 120% to find the price that will give Karan a 20% profit.
3. Calculate the price after the discount: Multiply the price from step 2 by 80% to find the price after offering a 20% discount.
4. Set up the equation: Let 'x' be the marked price. Write the equation as: x - 0.8x = 1440
5. Solve the equation: Simplify the equation and find the value of 'x' (marked price).
6. Check your calculations: Ensure that your calculations are accurate and that you have considered all the given information.
7. Choose the correct answer: Select the option that matches your calculated marked price.

Advice:
- Read the problem carefully and identify the given values, such as cost price, desired profit, and discount.
- Understand the concept of markup and discount: Markup increases the price, while discount decreases it.
- Practice solving equations with variables to find unknown values.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure you have considered all the necessary steps.
- Pay attention to units and percentages, and apply them correctly in your calculations.
