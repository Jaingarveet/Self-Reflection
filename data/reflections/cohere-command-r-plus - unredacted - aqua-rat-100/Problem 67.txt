Explanation:
I made a mistake in equating the number of pita breads to the number of rolls. I should have equated it to the number of baguettes. As a result, I incorrectly calculated the final answer.

Error Keywords:
- Equivalence error
- Comparison error
- Calculation error

Solution:
Given:
6 pita breads = 2 rolls
3 rolls = 5 baguettes

Step 1: Find the equivalence for 2 baguettes:
2 baguettes = 5/3 rolls (given: 3 rolls = 5 baguettes)

Step 2: Find the equivalence for 5/3 rolls in pita breads:
5/3 rolls = 6/5 * 5/3 pita breads = 3 pita breads

Therefore, 2 baguettes are equivalent to 3 pita breads.

Instructions:
1. Understand the given equivalences: 6 pita breads = 2 rolls, and 3 rolls = 5 baguettes.
2. Find the equivalence for 2 baguettes in terms of rolls.
3. Use the given equivalence to find the equivalence of that number of rolls in pita breads.
4. Express the final answer in the simplest form.

Advice:
- Carefully read and understand the relationships given in the question.
- Identify the relevant information and equivalences that will help you solve the problem.
- Systematically work through the problem, step-by-step, using the given information.
- Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are making the correct comparisons and equivalences.
