Explanation: I made a calculation error in determining the minimum selling price per component. I correctly calculated the total production cost and the required revenue, but I divided the selling price by the number of components produced per year, instead of the selling price, which should be divided by the number of components produced per month. 

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Arithmetic error
- Division error
- Incorrect variable

Solution: 

The company produces 420 units of the component monthly, so the yearly production is 420 * 12 = 5040 components. 

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the revenue from sales must exceed the production costs by this amount. 

Total production costs are 5040 * $110 = $554,400 

So, the total sales revenue required is $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800 

Now, to find the minimum selling price per component, we divide the total sales revenue by the number of components produced and sold monthly: 

$1,180,800 / 420 = $2800 / 9 = $311.11 (rounded to the nearest cent) 

So, the correct answer is B. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the given information: monthly production, monthly production cost, and the required yearly profit. 
2. Calculate the total number of components produced in a year. 
3. Determine the total sales revenue required to achieve the desired profit. 
4. Calculate the minimum selling price per component by dividing the total sales revenue by the number of components produced monthly. 
5. Ensure that you are dividing by the correct number (in this case, the monthly production, not the yearly production). 
6. Choose the answer option that matches your calculated result. 

Advice: 
 - Read the question carefully and identify the given information. 
 - Pay attention to the units and ensure you are performing calculations with consistent units. 
 - Double-check your calculations and ensure that you are dividing by the correct number. 
 - Always consider the context of the problem and whether your answer makes sense within that context. 
 - Practice similar problems to improve your calculation accuracy and familiarity with the concepts.
