Solution: 
The word "PROBLEC" has 7 letters, and we want to rearrange them to create 7-letter words. The letters can be rearranged in 7! ways. 

Instructions: 
1. Identify the number of letters in the given word. 
2. Understand that the question asks for permutations, as indicated by the factorial values in the options. 
3. Recognize that the letters can be rearranged to form 7-letter words, ignoring the repetition of letters. 
4. Calculate 7! (7 factorial) to find the number of possible arrangements. 

Advice: 
 - Read the question carefully and identify the task at hand. 
 - Pay attention to the options provided and understand their significance. 
 - Recognize when a question involves permutations or combinations, especially when factorial values are involved. 
 - Understand that permutations involve arranging items in a specific order, while combinations do not consider order. 
 - Practice calculating factorials and be comfortable with the concept of permutations and combinations.
