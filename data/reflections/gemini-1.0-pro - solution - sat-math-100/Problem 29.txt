Solution:
The weight of an object on Earth is 150 newtons.
The weight of an object on another planet is 170 newtons.
The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The acceleration due to gravity on the other planet is unknown.
The formula for weight is $W=m g$.
We can use the formula to find the acceleration due to gravity on the other planet.
$W=m g$
$170=m \times 9.8$
$m=\frac{170}{9.8}$
We can use the chart to find the planet with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
The planet with an acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$ is [REDACTED].
