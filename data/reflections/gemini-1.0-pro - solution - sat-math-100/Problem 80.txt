Solution:
To find the value of $k$ for which the system of equations has no solution, we can use the concept of elimination.
Multiply the first equation by $5$ and the second equation by $3$ to make the coefficients of $y$ equal but opposite:
$$\begin{aligned}& 5kx-15y=20 \\& 12x-15y=21\end{aligned}$$
Subtract the second equation from the first equation:
$$-7kx=-1$$
Divide both sides by $-7k$:
$$x=\frac{1}{7k}$$
Substitute this value of $x$ into the first equation:
$$k\cdot\frac{1}{7k}-3y=4$$
Simplify:
$$\frac{1}{7}-3y=4$$
Solve for $y$:
$$y=-\frac{29}{21}$$
Now, substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ into the second equation:
$$4\cdot\frac{1}{7k}-5\cdot\left(-\frac{29}{21}\right)=7$$
Simplify:
$$\frac{4}{7k}+\frac{145}{21}=7$$
Multiply both sides by $7k$:
$$4+145k=49k$$
Solve for $k$:
$$k=\frac{12}{5}$$
