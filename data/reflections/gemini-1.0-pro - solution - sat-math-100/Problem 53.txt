Solution:
The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$.
This means that for every 1 unit increase in the $x$ coordinate, the $y$ coordinate increases by $\frac{1}{7}$ units.
Starting from the origin $(0,0)$, we can move 14 units to the right to get to the point $(14,0)$.
To get to a point on the line, we need to move $\frac{1}{7}$ units up from $(14,0)$.
Therefore, the point [REDACTED] lies on the line.
