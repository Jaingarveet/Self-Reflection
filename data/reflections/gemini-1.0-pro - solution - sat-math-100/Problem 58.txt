Solution:
If $(0,0)$ is a solution, then both inequalities must be satisfied when $x=0$ and $y=0$.
The first inequality becomes $0<-0+a$, which simplifies to $a>0$.
The second inequality becomes $0>0+b$, which simplifies to $b<0$.
Since $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative, $a$ must be greater than $b$.
