Solution:
Let x be the original price of the computer.
After a 20% discount, the price becomes 0.8x.
An 8% sales tax is added, resulting in a final price of 1.08(0.8x) = 0.864x.
We are given that the final price is p dollars, so 0.864x = p.
To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.864: x = p / 0.864.
The original price of the computer is p / 0.864, which can be written as p / (0.8)(1.08).
