Solution:
The helicopter's initial altitude is 40 feet, and it gains altitude at a rate of 21 feet per second. This means that the helicopter's altitude is increasing linearly with time.
The slope of the linear equation is equal to the rate of change, which is 21 feet per second.
The y-intercept of the linear equation is equal to the initial altitude, which is 40 feet.
The equation for a line with a slope of 21 and a y-intercept of 40 is $y=21t+40$.
