Solution:
The equation can be simplified to $0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$.
Combining like terms, we get $0.02x=0.02y$.
Dividing both sides by 0.02, we get $x=y$.
Since Clayton uses [REDACTED] milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, he must also use [REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
However, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: 2[REDACTED].
This is because the equation $x=y$ only tells us that the amount of the $10 \%$ solution is equal to the amount of the $20 \%$ solution, but it does not tell us the actual value of x or y.
To find the actual value of x, we can substitute y=[REDACTED] into the equation $0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$.
This gives us $0.10x+0.20([REDACTED])=0.18(x+[REDACTED])$.
Simplifying this equation, we get $0.10x+20=0.18x+18$.
Combining like terms, we get $0.08x=2$.
Dividing both sides by 0.08, we get $x=2[REDACTED]$.
Therefore, Clayton must use 2[REDACTED] milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
