Solution:
The distance between the center $(0,4)$ and the point $\left(\frac{4}{3}, 5\right)$ is the radius of the circle.
Using the distance formula, we find that the radius is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{3}-0\right)^2+(5-4)^2}=\sqrt{\frac{16}{9}+1}=\sqrt{\frac{25}{9}}=\frac{5}{3}$.
The equation of a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$.
The center of the circle is $(0,4)$, and the radius is $\frac{5}{3}$.
Therefore, the equation of the circle is $(x-0)^2+(y-4)^2=\left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2$, which simplifies to [REDACTED].
