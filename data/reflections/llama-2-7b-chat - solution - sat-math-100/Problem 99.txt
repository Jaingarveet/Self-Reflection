Solution:

To find the value of $f([REDACTED])$, we need to plug $[REDACTED]$ into the formula for $f(x)$:

$$f([REDACTED]) = \frac{[REDACTED] + 3}{[REDACTED]}$$

Step-by-step calculation:

[REDACTED]. Subtract $3$ from $[REDACTED]$ to get $[REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Divide by $[REDACTED]$ to simplify the fraction.

Therefore, $f([REDACTED]) = [REDACTED]$.
