Solution:
To find the value of $n$ such that $|n-[REDACTED]| + [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]$, we need to isolate the absolute value of $n-[REDACTED]$ on one side of the equation and then add [REDACTED] to both sides.

Step-by-step solution:

[REDACTED]. Isolate the absolute value of $n-[REDACTED]$ on one side of the equation by using the absolute value symbol: $|n-[REDACTED]| = n-[REDACTED]$.
[REDACTED]. Add [REDACTED] to both sides of the equation: $n-[REDACTED] + [REDACTED] = n$.
3. Simplify the equation: $n = [REDACTED]$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) [REDACTED]
