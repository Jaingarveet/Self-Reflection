Solution:

1. Identify the lines given in the problem: $y = -x + a$ and $y = x + b$.
2. Find the point of intersection between the two lines: $(0,0)$.
3. Check the inequality conditions at the point of intersection: $y > x + b$ and $y < -x + a$.
4. Determine the relationship between $a$ and $b$ based on the inequality conditions: $b > a$.
