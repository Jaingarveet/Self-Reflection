Solution:

[REDACTED]. Start with the given equation: $\frac{x^{2}-[REDACTED]}{x-[REDACTED]} = -2$
2. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by $x-[REDACTED]$, which gives us $x^{2} - 2 = [REDACTED]$
3. Factor the left-hand side of the equation as $x^{2} - 2 = (x + [REDACTED])(x - 2) = [REDACTED]$
4. Solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to $[REDACTED]$ and solving for $x$
5. Check the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation
