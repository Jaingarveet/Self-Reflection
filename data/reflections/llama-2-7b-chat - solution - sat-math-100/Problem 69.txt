Solution:

To reduce Alan's weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$, he needs to drive fewer miles. Let's use the equation:

$$\frac{25}{4} m = 95$$

Where $m$ is the number of fewer miles Alan should drive each week.

Rearranging the equation, we get:

$$m = \frac{95}{25}$$

So, Alan should drive $5$ fewer miles each week to reduce his weekly expenditure on gasoline by $\$ 5$.
