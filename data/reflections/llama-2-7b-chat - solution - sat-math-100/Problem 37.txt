Solution:
The volume of the first cylinder is [REDACTED] cubic centimeters.
The radius of the first cylinder is twice the radius of the second cylinder, so the radius of the second cylinder is 1/2 of the radius of the first cylinder.
The height of the first cylinder is half the height of the second cylinder, so the height of the second cylinder is 2 times the height of the first cylinder.
Using the formula V = πr^2h, we can calculate the volume of the second cylinder as follows:
V = π(1/2)^2 \* 2h = π \* 1/4 \* 2 \* [REDACTED] = [REDACTED] cubic centimeters
