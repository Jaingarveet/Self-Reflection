Solution:
We are given the equation $\frac{3}{5}w = \frac{4}{3}$. To solve for $w$, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

$$\frac{3}{5}w = \frac{4}{3} \Rightarrow 3w = 4 \cdot \frac{5}{3}$$

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by $3$ to get:

$$w = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{9}$$

Therefore, the value of $w$ is [REDACTED].
