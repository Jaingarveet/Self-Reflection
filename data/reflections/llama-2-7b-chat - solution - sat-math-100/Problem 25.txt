Solution:

The correct solution is:

$$y = x^[REDACTED]$$

Substituting this expression into the second equation:

$$[REDACTED]y + 6 = [REDACTED](x + [REDACTED])$$

Simplifying and solving for $y$:

$$y = x^[REDACTED] + [REDACTED]x + 6$$

Since $(x, y) = ([REDACTED], 4)$, we have:

$$x y = [REDACTED] \times 4 = 8$$

Therefore, the value of $x y$ is $8$.
