Solution:

To find the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$, we need to find the number that has the same power of 9 as $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$. In this case, the power of 9 is 3/4, which means we need to find a number that has a power of 3/4.

The correct calculation is:

$9^{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \sqrt[4]{9} = 9 \times \sqrt{3} \times 3 = 3 \sqrt{3}$

So, the equivalent of $9^{\frac{3}{4}}$ is [REDACTED].
