Solution:
The key to resolving the inconsistency lies in understanding where the investigations are focused. Option [REDACTED] reveals that these investigations are primarily in urban areas. This implies that the data from cities with strict drunk driving investigations might be skewed towards areas with inherently higher accident rates due to factors like traffic density. Therefore, the similar accident rates between cities with and without strict investigations might not be a direct reflection of the effectiveness of the policy itself.
