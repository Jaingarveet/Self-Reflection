Explanation:
The statement suggests that a developing country must strengthen the competitiveness of its domestic enterprises to maintain its economic development, and establish and improve social security systems to maintain social stability. However, paying social insurance premiums for employees reduces the competitiveness of enterprises. Therefore, the country cannot maintain both economic development and social stability simultaneously.

Choice "[REDACTED]" is the best answer, as it states that the country cannot maintain its economic development or maintain its social stability.

Choice "[REDACTED]" is incorrect, as it suggests that the country has to choose between economic development and social stability, whereas the statement implies that both are necessary.

Choice "[REDACTED]" is also incorrect, as reducing the proportion of companies paying social insurance premiums for employees may not necessarily maintain the competitiveness of the company, as the statement suggests that paying such premiums reduces competitiveness.

Choice "[REDACTED]" is partially correct, as the economic development of the country will indeed be affected to some extent, but it does not directly address the main issue of the country's inability to maintain both economic development and social stability.

Therefore, the correct answer is "[REDACTED]".
