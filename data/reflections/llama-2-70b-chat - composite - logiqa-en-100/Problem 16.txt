Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the economist's hypothesis.
I thought the hypothesis was about the profitability of polluting industries in different countries, but the correct hypothesis is about the importance of a good natural environment for people in different countries.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation of the question
- Misunderstanding of the hypothesis
- Lack of attention to detail
Solution:
The economist's hypothesis is that a good natural environment is more important for people in developed countries than people in developing countries. This means that people in developed countries value a clean environment more than people in developing countries, who may be more concerned with economic growth and employment opportunities.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the hypothesis discussed by the economist.
2. Pay attention to the keywords in the question, such as "developed countries," "developing countries," "natural environment," "polluting industries," and "profits."
3. Consider the context of the question and the possible implications of transferring polluting industries between countries.
4. Evaluate each choice and determine which one aligns with the economist's hypothesis.
5. Choose the correct answer.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the context.
- Pay attention to the keywords in the question and their implications.
- Consider different perspectives and possible interpretations of the question.
- Evaluate each choice carefully and choose the one that best aligns with the given information.
- Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence.
