Explanation:
The argument states that if Green Island increases productivity by 10%, it can achieve the goal of increasing productivity by 20%. This implies that if the company fails to increase productivity by 20%, it will not achieve its goal and will go bankrupt. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.

Here's a breakdown of the other options:

[REDACTED]: This statement is not necessarily true. Even if Green Island fails to achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it may still be able to avoid bankruptcy if it increases productivity by 10%.

[REDACTED]: This statement is false. According to the argument, Green Island must increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy, regardless of whether the market changes.

[REDACTED]: This statement is impossible. If Green Island increases productivity by 10% over the next two years, it will have achieved its goal of increasing productivity by 20%.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
