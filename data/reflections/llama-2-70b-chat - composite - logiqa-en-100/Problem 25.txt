From (4), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall.

We can deduce that [REDACTED] is not tall, and [REDACTED] is tall.
[REDACTED] is a doctor, and we know that he is tall because [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are the same height, and [REDACTED] is not a doctor.
Therefore, [REDACTED] meets all of Li Na's requirements.
