Explanation:
My answer was incorrect because I failed to consider the possibility that the cave could have been used for a different purpose other than residential.
The correct answer, [REDACTED], states that the cave is actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue, which would explain the presence of various tools and artifacts without necessarily implying that hundreds of people lived in the cave.
