Explanation:
The correct answer is choice [REDACTED], "[REDACTED]"

This choice is the most reliable because it provides objective data on the relationship between housing prices and land prices in Beijing. The data shows that housing prices increased by 7.2% while land prices rose by 0.37%, which suggests that the increase in housing prices may not be solely due to the increase in land prices. This information contradicts the assertion in choice [REDACTED], which states that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the most doubtful of the assertion.

Choice [REDACTED] provides data on the increase in housing and land prices in Shanghai, but it does not provide enough information to contradict the assertion. Choice [REDACTED] is a statement from the chairman of Yongtai Development Company, which suggests that high demand for housing is a factor in rising housing prices, but it does not directly address the relationship between land prices and housing prices.
