Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I misunderstood the conditions and incorrectly concluded that option [REDACTED] was the correct answer.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of conditions
* Incorrect application of logic

Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions again:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
4. F must be allocated in the production department.

From condition 3, we know that X and W cannot be allocated to the same department. Therefore, option [REDACTED], [REDACTED], is not a valid pair for the sales department.

Instead, let's consider option [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. If G is allocated to the sales department, X must be allocated to the production department, according to condition 3. This satisfies all the conditions and is a valid pair for the sales department.

Therefore, the correct answer is option [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Read the conditions carefully and understand the problem.
2. Identify the constraints that apply to each department.
3. Eliminate any pairs that violate the conditions.
4. Choose the remaining pair that satisfies all the conditions.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Identify the key constraints and conditions that apply to each department.
* Use a systematic approach to eliminate pairs that violate the conditions.
* Double-check your answer to ensure it satisfies all the conditions.
* Practice logical reasoning to improve your ability to analyze complex problems.
