Explanation:
The argument "Taiwanese are not Chinese" is based on a false premise. The fact that Taiwanese people are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China does not mean they are not Chinese. Chinese refers to a person's ethnicity, culture, or nationality, which is not determined by their political status or jurisdiction.

The closest analogy to this argument is choice [REDACTED], which argues that air is a commodity because it has use value. However, air is not a commodity in the classical sense, as it is not something that can be bought or sold. Similarly, the argument that Taiwanese are not Chinese because they are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China is also flawed, as it is based on a faulty premise.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
