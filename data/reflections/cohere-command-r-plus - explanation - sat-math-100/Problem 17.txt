Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that $[REDACTED]b$ in the numerator would cancel out with $a$ in the denominator, resulting in a final value of $\frac{[REDACTED]}{[REDACTED]}$. However, my mistake was in not recognizing that $[REDACTED]b$ should be simplified to $[REDACTED]a$ before proceeding with the calculation. This incorrect assumption led me to choose answer option [REDACTED].
