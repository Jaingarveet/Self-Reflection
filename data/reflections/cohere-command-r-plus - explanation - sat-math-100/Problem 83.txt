Explanation:
I misunderstood the concept of statistical sampling and representation. 
I incorrectly assumed that surveying all employees in a single store would provide a comprehensive view of job satisfaction. 
However, the correct answer recognizes that to estimate the proportion of satisfied employees across all stores, a sample of employees from each store is more representative.
