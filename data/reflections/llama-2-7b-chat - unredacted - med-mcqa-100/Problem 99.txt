 Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the principal site of acidification of urine as the loop of Henle, when in fact it is the collecting duct.

The loop of Henle is a part of the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney, and it is involved in the reabsorption of water and ions. However, the acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct, which is the final part of the nephron where the urine is concentrated and prepared for excretion.

Error Keywords:

* Loop of Henle
* Collecting duct
* DCT
* PCT

Solution:
The principal site of acidification of urine is the collecting duct in the kidney.
The collecting duct is the part of the nephron where the urine is concentrated and prepared for excretion.
The acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct through the action of hydrogen ions (H+) and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).
Instructions:

1. Identify the part of the kidney where acidification of urine occurs.
2. Understand the process of acidification of urine in the collecting duct.
3. Recall the correct answer, which is the collecting duct.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the acidification of urine occurs in the collecting duct, not the loop of Henle.
