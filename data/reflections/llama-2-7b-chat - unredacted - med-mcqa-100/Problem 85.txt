 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as "D: Psoriatic arthritis" when the correct answer is "C: Reactive arthritis".

Keratoderma blenorrhagica is a skin condition that is commonly associated with reactive arthritis, not psoriatic arthritis. Reactive arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in response to an infection, usually in the gut or genitals. It can cause skin lesions, including keratoderma blenorrhagica, which is characterized by thickening and scaling of the skin, as well as bleeding.

I made this mistake because I misunderstood the relationship between keratoderma blenorrhagica and psoriatic arthritis. While psoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that can cause skin lesions, including psoriasis, it is not typically associated with keratoderma blenorrhagica.
