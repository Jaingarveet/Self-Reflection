 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation when answering the question. I calculated the pH using the formula pH = -log[H+], but I forgot to take into account the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-).

The correct calculation for the pH of the solution is:

pH = -log[H+] - log[OH-]

Since the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) is not given, we can assume that it is negligible compared to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). Therefore, the pH of the solution can be calculated as:

pH = -log(1 x 10-6) = -6 - log(0) = -6

So, the pH of the solution is B, which is 6.

Error Keywords:

* Neglecting to consider the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-)
* Using the pH formula without considering the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-)

Solution:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:

1. Identify the given information: concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) = 1 x 10-6 moles/litre
2. Calculate the pH of the solution using the pH formula: pH = -log[H+]
3. Consider the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and calculate the pH of the solution using the updated formula: pH = -log[H+] - log[OH-]

Advice:

* Always consider all the given information when solving a problem.
* Use the correct formula for the problem, and make sure to include all the necessary terms.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Always consider the units of measurement when calculating quantities.
