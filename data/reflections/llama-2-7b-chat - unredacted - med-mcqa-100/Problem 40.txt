 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option D, which is ALT.

The correct answer is option A, which is Lipase.

I misunderstood the question and thought that all of the options were enzymes produced and secreted by the liver. However, ALP (Alanine Aminotransferase) is an enzyme produced by the liver, but it is not secreted into the bloodstream. AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) is also an enzyme produced by the liver, but it is not secreted into the bloodstream. ALT (Alanine Transaminase) is an enzyme produced by the liver and secreted into the bloodstream.
