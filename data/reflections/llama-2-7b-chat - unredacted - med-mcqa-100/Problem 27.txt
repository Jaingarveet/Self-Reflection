 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option B, which is the cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer. However, the correct answer is option C, which is the actual cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the cut-off value
* Confusion with similar values

Solution:
CA-125 is a tumor marker used to diagnose and monitor ovarian cancer. The cut-off value for CA-125 is an important factor in determining whether a patient has ovarian cancer or not. The correct cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer is 35 units/ml.

Instructions:

1. Identify the tumor marker being discussed (CA-125).
2. Understand the purpose of the tumor marker (diagnosis and monitoring of ovarian cancer).
3. Determine the cut-off value for CA-125 in ovarian cancer (35 units/ml).
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches the correct cut-off value.

Advice:

* Always review and understand the topic and question before answering.
* Take your time and read the question carefully to avoid mistakes.
