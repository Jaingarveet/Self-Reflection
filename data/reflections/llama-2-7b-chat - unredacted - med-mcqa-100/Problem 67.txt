 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question as there is a major complication of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst that is not fistula, but rather hemorrhage.

Error Keywords:

* Fistula
* Hemorrhage

Solution:
Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that involves creating a connection between a cyst and the stomach to drain the cyst. One of the major complications of this procedure is hemorrhage.

Instructions:

1. Identify the surgical procedure being discussed: cyst-gastrostomy.
2. List the major complications of the procedure: infection, obstruction, fistula, and hemorrhage.
3. Choose the correct answer based on the information provided.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
* Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
* Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
* Remember that the major complications of cyst-gastrostomy for pseudo pancreatic cyst are infection, obstruction, fistula, and hemorrhage, not fistula and hemorrhage.
