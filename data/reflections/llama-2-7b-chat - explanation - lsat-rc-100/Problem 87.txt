Explanation:
The correct answer is (E) The size of neurotransmitter binding sites on receptors plays no role in neuron communication, as mentioned in the passage. The passage does not discuss the size of neurotransmitter binding sites on receptors, and therefore, this option is the exception.

The other options are either directly or indirectly related to the passage's content:

Option [REDACTED] is supported by the passage's mention of the secretion of neurotransmitters.

Option [REDACTED] is also supported by the passage's mention of the flow of ions through neurons.

Option [REDACTED] is affirmed by the passage, as the binding of neurotransmitters to receptors plays a role in neuron communication.

Option [REDACTED] is the correct answer, as the structure of receptors on neuron surfaces plays a role in neuron communication, as mentioned in the passage.
