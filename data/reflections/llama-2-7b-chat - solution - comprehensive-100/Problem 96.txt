Solution:
Protein structure refers to the arrangement of amino acids in a protein molecule. Denaturation is the process of losing the native three-dimensional structure of a protein due to various factors such as temperature, pH, or the presence of chemical denaturants.

The primary structure of a protein refers to the sequence of amino acids in the protein molecule. This structure is not lost in denaturation.
