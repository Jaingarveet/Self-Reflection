Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the rules and the limitations they imposed on the employees.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my logical reasoning and analysis.
I did not consider all the rules and their implications fully.
I stopped my analysis too early, not realizing that further limitations could be inferred.

Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Analysis error
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Insufficient consideration of rules

Solution:
Let's analyze the rules given:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

From rule 4, we know that Robertson can only be assigned one of the four lower-numbered spaces. Since Robertson must have a higher-numbered space than Young, Young can only be assigned one of the three remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1, #2, or #3).

Now, since Young must have a higher-numbered space than Togowa, Togowa can only be assigned one of the two remaining lower-numbered spaces (#1 or #2).

However, we must also consider rule 2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered space than Souza. Since Robertson can only occupy one of the four lower-numbered spaces, and Young and Togowa must occupy two of the remaining three lower-numbered spaces, Souza can only be assigned the remaining lower-numbered space (#1, #2, or #3). This means that Xu can only be assigned one of the two remaining higher-numbered spaces (#5 or #6).

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Analyze each rule given in the problem.
3. Consider the implications of each rule on the possible assignments.
4. Identify the employees whose assignments are limited to only two possible spaces.
5. Count the number of employees with such limitations.
6. Double-check your analysis and calculations.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always analyze each rule given in the problem.
 - Always consider the implications of each rule on the possible assignments.
 - Never stop your analysis too early; consider all rules and their implications.
 - Always double-check your analysis and calculations.
 - Remember that logical reasoning and analysis are crucial in solving complex problems.
