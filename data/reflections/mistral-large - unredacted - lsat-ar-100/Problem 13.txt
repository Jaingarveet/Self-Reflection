Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the witnesses' schedules.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I knew the conditions for the schedule but made an incorrect inference.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Since Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day, and Iturbe is already scheduled to testify on Wednesday, Franco and Garcia must testify on either Monday or Tuesday.
Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, and Franco and Hong must testify on the same day, Franco and Hong must be scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
Therefore, Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Monday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions for the schedule.
2. Identify the possible days for each witness to testify based on the conditions.
3. Identify the day on which Franco and Hong must testify together.
4. Identify the day on which Garcia must testify based on the conditions.
5. Choose the answer that matches your inferred schedule.

 - Never make assumptions; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
