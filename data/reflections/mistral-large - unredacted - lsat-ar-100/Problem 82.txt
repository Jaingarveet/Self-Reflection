Explanation:
I made an error in evaluating the conditions given in the question.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in my understanding of the conditions and my evaluation of the choices.
I incorrectly evaluated choice B as violating condition 3, but it actually satisfies all conditions.

Error Keywords:
 - Evaluation error
 - Condition analysis error
 - Choice evaluation error

Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions given:

1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
2. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
3. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Now let's evaluate each choice:

A: Zone 1: Kim, Parra Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Quinn, Tiao

* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

B: Zone 1: Kim, Tiao Zone 2: Stuckey, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn

* This choice satisfies all conditions.

C: Zone 1: Parra, Quinn Zone 2: Kim, Udall Zone 3: Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao

* This choice violates condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

D: Zone 1: Stuckey, Udall Zone 2: Kim, Tiao Zone 3: Mahr, Parra, Quinn

* This choice violates condition 2 (Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2) and condition 4 (Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other).

E: Zone 1: Tiao Zone 2: Kim, Parra, Quinn Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall

* This choice violates condition 5 (There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2).

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the conditions.
2. Analyze each condition and its implications.
3. Evaluate each choice against the conditions.
4. Work step-by-step through your evaluation of each choice.
5. Double-check your evaluation to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all conditions.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your evaluation and final answer.
 - Remember that each condition must be satisfied by the correct answer.
