Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the constraints of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I misunderstood the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
I assumed that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships, but this is not necessarily true.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misunderstanding of constraints
Solution:
The constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships means that they cannot be assigned to the same ambassadorship.
The constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne means that if Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne must also be assigned to a different ambassadorship.
The constraint that if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen means that if Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
The constraint that if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia means that Landon can only be assigned to Zambia.
The only option that cannot be true is that Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia because if Novetzke is assigned to Zambia, then Kayne cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship, which violates the constraint that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the constraints that apply to each ambassador.
3. Consider each option and determine whether it violates any of the constraints.
4. Eliminate any options that violate the constraints.
5. Choose the option that cannot be true based on the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always consider each option and determine whether it violates any of the constraints.
 - Always eliminate any options that violate the constraints.
 - Never make assumptions about the constraints that are not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
