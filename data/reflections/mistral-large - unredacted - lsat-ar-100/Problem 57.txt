Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions for Helen and Irving giving reports.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in understanding the conditions of the problem.
I misunderstood the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of conditions
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of problem
Solution:
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but George must also give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but George cannot give a report on Wednesday, which is not possible.
Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Irving must also give a report on Wednesday, which is possible.
If Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia cannot give a report on Wednesday, which is not possible.
Therefore, Kyle cannot give a report on Wednesday.
