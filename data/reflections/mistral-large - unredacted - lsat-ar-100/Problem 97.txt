Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the conditions of the problem.
The gap in my knowledge was not in law but in logical reasoning.
I assumed that since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Tuesday. However, this is not necessarily true.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
Solution:
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday.
Therefore, two different kinds of cookies (oatmeal and sugar) have their first batch made on Monday.
Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
Since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
Therefore, two different kinds of cookies (oatmeal and peanut butter) cannot have their second batch made on Wednesday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions of the problem.
2. Identify the relationships between the different kinds of cookies.
3. Use logical reasoning to determine the possible and impossible scenarios.
4. Work step-by-step through your reasoning.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your determined scenario.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never make assumptions about the conditions of the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is a critical skill in solving complex problems.
