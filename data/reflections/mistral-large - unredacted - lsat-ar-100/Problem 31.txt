Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the order in which the batches of cookies are made.
The gap in my knowledge was not in the law but in the interpretation of the given conditions.
I assumed that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made after the first batch, but the conditions do not specify this.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
 - Order of events
Solution:
The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, as the first batch of oatmeal cookies is already made on Monday.
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Thursday, as only one batch of each kind of cookie is made on a single day.
Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, as it is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Friday.
The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Tuesday.
The third batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Thursday.
The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday, as the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. It also cannot be made on Wednesday, as the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. Therefore, it must be made on Monday.
The third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday, Thursday, or Friday, as those days are already taken by other batches of cookies. Therefore, it must be made on Wednesday.
Instructions:
1. Identify the conditions given in the problem.
2. Determine the possible days on which each batch of cookies can be made based on the conditions.
3. Consider all possible orders in which the batches of cookies can be made.
4. Work step-by-step through each batch of cookies, eliminating impossible days based on the conditions.
5. Double-check your reasoning and the days assigned to each batch of cookies.
6. Choose the answer that matches your determined list of days.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider all possible orders in which events can occur.
 - Always work step-by-step through each subproblem, eliminating impossible options.
 - Never make assumptions about the order of events unless explicitly stated in the conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and final answer.
