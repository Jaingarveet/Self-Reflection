Explanation:
I misunderstood the original constraint and the effect of the answer choices.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the constraints and their implications.
I did not consider the possibility that the constraint could be rephrased in a way that still maintains the same effect.
I also did not fully consider the implications of each answer choice.

Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of constraints
 - Misinterpretation of answer choices
 - Lack of consideration of implications

Solution:
The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
Option D states that no more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, this constraint effectively separates the two restaurants by at least two other businesses.

Instructions:
1. Carefully read and understand the original constraint.
2. Consider the implications of the constraint on the arrangement of the businesses.
3. Carefully read and understand each answer choice.
4. Consider the implications of each answer choice on the arrangement of the businesses.
5. Compare the implications of each answer choice to the implications of the original constraint.
6. Choose the answer choice that has the same effect as the original constraint.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always consider the implications of each constraint and answer choice.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that constraints can be rephrased in different ways while still maintaining the same effect.
