Explanation:
I made an incorrect assumption about the selection of botanists.
The gap in my knowledge was not understanding that more than one botanist could be selected if only one zoologist is selected, as long as there is at least one scientist of each type.
I also overlooked the fact that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected, which means that all three zoologists must be selected.

Error Keywords:
- Incorrect assumption
- Misunderstanding of selection criteria
- Overlooking information

Solution:
If M is the only chemist selected, then both P and R must be selected (since the rule states that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected).
Since at least one scientist of each type must be selected, at least one botanist must be selected.
However, since more than one botanist can be selected if only one zoologist is selected, as long as there is at least one scientist of each type, more than one botanist can be selected.
Therefore, the panel must consist of M (chemist), at least one botanist, and P, Q, and R (zoologists).

Instructions:
1. Identify the given condition that M is the only chemist selected.
2. Identify the rule that if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
3. Identify the rule that at least one scientist of each type must be selected.
4. Identify the rule that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
5. Consider all possible combinations of scientists that satisfy all the given rules.
6. Eliminate any answer choices that do not satisfy all the given rules.
7. Choose the answer that must be true based on the given rules.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always consider all the given rules and conditions.
- Always think through each possible combination of scientists that satisfies all the given rules.
- Never make assumptions without verifying them against the given rules.
- Always double-check your answer against the given rules to ensure accuracy.
- Remember that more than one scientist of each type can be selected as long as all the given rules are satisfied.
