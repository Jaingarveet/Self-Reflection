Advice:
- Always understand the main argument and the counter-argument.
- Identify the point of contention between the two arguments.
- Evaluate the options based on how effectively they counter the objection and support the original claim.
- Don't get distracted by details that don't directly address the main argument or counter-argument.
- Remember that the best counter-argument directly addresses the point of contention.
