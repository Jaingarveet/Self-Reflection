Advice:
- Always understand the logical structure of the argument.
- Identify the cause and effect relationship in the argument.
- Look for the condition that leads to the cause.
- Compare the pattern of reasoning in the argument with the choices given.
- Don't assume that the argument is based on a single cause-effect relationship. There may be a sequence of events or conditions leading to the final effect.
