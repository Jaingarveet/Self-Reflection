Advice:
- Always read the argument carefully and understand the main point.
- Try to identify the underlying assumption in the argument.
- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the main point and the identified assumption.
- Don't focus too narrowly on one aspect of the argument; consider the broader implications.
- Remember that the correct answer is the one that best supports the argument's reasoning, not necessarily the one that seems most immediately relevant.
