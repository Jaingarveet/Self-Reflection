Explanation:
I made an error in setting up the equation to solve for the total number of matches played by Sachin. I incorrectly assumed that the new total matches would be (x + 1), but this is not correct because the finals match is included in the total matches played.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect equation setup
 - Misinterpretation of given information
 - Algebra error
Solution:
Let the total number of matches played by Sachin be x.
His current batting average is 51, which means the total runs scored divided by the number of matches is 51.
* Total runs = 51 * x
In the finals, he scores 7[REDACTED] runs. So, the new total runs will be:
* New total runs = 51 * x + 7[REDACTED]
His new batting average is 54, which means the new total runs divided by the total matches (x) is 54.
* 54 = (51 * x + 7[REDACTED]) / x
Solve the equation:
* 54x = 51x + 7[REDACTED]
* 3x = 7[REDACTED]
* x = 2[REDACTED]
Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 2[REDACTED].
However, 2[REDACTED] is not one of the given choices. Let's check each choice:
A) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
B) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
C) [REDACTED]: 54 = (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED] (correct)
D) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
E) [REDACTED]: 54 ≠ (51 * [REDACTED] + 7[REDACTED]) / [REDACTED]
Therefore, the correct answer is C) [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: current batting average, runs scored in the finals, new batting average.
2. Set up a variable (e.g., x) to represent the unknown quantity, which is the total number of matches played.
3. Express the total runs in terms of the current batting average and the total matches played.
4. Add the runs scored in the finals to the total runs.
5. Set up an equation using the new batting average, new total runs, and total matches played.
[REDACTED]. Solve the equation for the total number of matches played.
7. If the calculated value is not one of the given choices, check each choice by substituting it into the equation.
[REDACTED]. Choose the answer that satisfies the equation.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the given information and the unknown quantity.
 - Set up equations based on the relationships between the given information and the unknown quantity.
 - Be careful when setting up equations, ensuring that all terms are correctly represented.
 - If the calculated value is not one of the given choices, check each choice to find the correct answer.
 - Double-check your calculations and equations to avoid algebra errors.
