Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I correctly identified that the total number of students must be a multiple of 25 for both the percentage of physics students and math students to be whole numbers. However, I failed to consider the additional constraint that the sum of the percentages of physics and math students should not exceed 100%. If 48% of the students took either physics or math, then the remaining 52% must have taken neither, which is not possible if every student must take at least one of these subjects.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical error
 - Constraint satisfaction error
 - Percentage sum error
Solution:
Let the total number of students be x.
Number of students who took physics = 20% of x = 0.2x (must be a whole number)
Number of students who took math = 28% of x = 0.28x (must be a whole number)
For 0.2x and 0.28x to be whole numbers, x must be a multiple of 25.
The least multiple of 25 greater than 501 is 525. However, 20% of 525 is 105 and 28% of 525 is 147. The sum 105 + 147 = 252, which is 48% of 525. This implies that 52% of students took neither physics nor math, which is not possible.
In fact, for any number of students, the sum of the percentages of physics and math students cannot exceed 100%. Therefore, there is no possible number of students that satisfies the given conditions.
Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints on the total number of students based on the given percentages.
2. Find the least number that satisfies these constraints.
3. Check if this number satisfies any additional unstated constraints.
4. If any constraint is violated, conclude that no number can satisfy all conditions.
Advice:
 - Always consider all explicit and implicit constraints in the problem.
 - Check your solution against all constraints to ensure it is valid.
 - If a problem seems unsolvable, consider the possibility that there may be no solution.
 - When dealing with percentages, remember that the sum of all percentages must equal 100%.
