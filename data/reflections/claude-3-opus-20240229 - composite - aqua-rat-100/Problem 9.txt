Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the number of bags sold. I divided the total profit by the profit per bag, but this is incorrect because the profit per bag was calculated as a percentage of the selling price, not the cost price. To find the number of bags sold, I should have divided the total profit by the profit per bag in dollars, not as a percentage.

 - Profit calculation error
Solution:
1. Understand the given information:
   * The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
   * Each bag is sold for $100.
   * The total profit made is $3,000.
2. Calculate the profit made on each bag in dollars:
   * Profit per bag = Selling price - Cost price
   * 25% of Selling price = Selling price - Cost price
   * 0.25 ร $100 = $100 - Cost price
   * $25 = $100 - Cost price
   * Cost price = $100 - $25 = $75
   * Profit per bag = $100 - $75 = $25
3. Calculate the number of bags sold:
   * Number of bags sold = Total profit รท Profit per bag
   * Number of bags sold = $3,000 รท $25 = [REDACTED]0
4. Find the answer among the given choices:
   * The closest choice to [REDACTED]0 is [REDACTED]0 itself, but it's not available.
   * The next closest choice is [REDACTED]0 รท 5 = [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information.
2. Understand the relationship between selling price, cost price, and profit.
3. Calculate the profit per bag in dollars, not as a percentage.
4. Use the total profit and profit per bag to calculate the number of bags sold.
5. Choose the answer closest to your calculated result.

 - Make sure you understand the relationships between different quantities (e.g., selling price, cost price, profit).
 - Remember that percentages need to be converted to actual dollar amounts for calculations.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - If your calculated answer is not available, choose the closest option.
