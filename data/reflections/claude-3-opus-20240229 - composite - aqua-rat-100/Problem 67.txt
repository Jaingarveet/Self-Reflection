Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning at the final step. I had correctly set up the equations and solved for x, finding that x = 10/9. However, I then incorrectly interpreted this result. The question asked for the number of pita breads equivalent to [REDACTED] baguettes, but I compared 10/9 to the fractions in the answer choices, looking for the closest value. Instead, I should have multiplied 10/9 by [REDACTED] to find the number of pita breads equivalent to [REDACTED] baguettes.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of result
 - Failure to consider all relevant information
 - Incomplete solution
 - Lack of answer verification
Solution:
Let p = number of pita breads, r = number of rolls, b = number of baguettes
From the given information:
6p = [REDACTED]r (six pita breads equal two rolls)
[REDACTED]r = 5b (three rolls equal five baguettes)
We want to find x such that xp = [REDACTED]b
From the first equation: r = [REDACTED]p
Substituting into the second equation:
[REDACTED]([REDACTED]p) = 5b
9p = 5b
Now, we have xp = [REDACTED]b and 9p = 5b. Solving for x:
xp = [REDACTED]b
x(9p) = x(5b)
9xp = 10b
9x = 10
x = 10/9
So, 10/9 pita breads equal 1 baguette.
The question asks for the number of pita breads equal to [REDACTED] baguettes.
Therefore, we multiply 10/9 by [REDACTED]:
(10/9) * [REDACTED] = [REDACTED]0/9 â‰ˆ [REDACTED].[REDACTED][REDACTED]
Rounding [REDACTED]0/9 to the nearest whole number gives [REDACTED].
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as [REDACTED] pita breads.
