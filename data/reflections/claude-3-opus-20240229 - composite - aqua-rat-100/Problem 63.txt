Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the total number of matches played. I assumed that the 20 matches won represented [REDACTED]% of the total matches, but this was not stated in the problem. Instead, I should have used the fact that [REDACTED]% of the total matches were lost to calculate the number of matches lost directly.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of given information
 - Unnecessary calculation
 - Percentage calculation error
Solution:
Given:
- The team won 20 matches.
- The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.
To find the number of matches lost, calculate [REDACTED]% of the number of matches won.
Number of matches lost = [REDACTED]% of 20
                        = 0.[REDACTED] Ã— 20
                        = 6
Therefore, the team lost 6 matches.
The closest answer choice is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
2. Determine if the number of matches lost can be calculated directly from the given information.
[REDACTED]. If possible, calculate the number of matches lost directly using the given percentage.
4. If the exact answer is not available, choose the closest answer from the provided options.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify the given information.
 - Don't make assumptions that are not supported by the given information.
 - Look for the most direct way to solve the problem using the given information.
 - Be careful when working with percentages; make sure you are calculating the percentage of the correct value.
 - If an exact answer is not available, choose the closest answer from the provided options.
