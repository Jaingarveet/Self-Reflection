Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation. I correctly identified that each picket plus space is 13/2 inches wide, and that the total width in inches is [REDACTED]. However, I failed to account for the fact that there is one less space than there are pickets. With x pickets, there are only x-1 spaces. So the correct total width in inches is [REDACTED] - 6, not [REDACTED]. When converting to feet, this becomes ([REDACTED] - 6)/12 = (13x - 12)/24 feet.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Logical error
 - Fence length calculation
 - Pickets and spaces
 - Unit conversion error
Solution:
1) Each picket is 1/2 inch wide.
2) There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. 
3) So, the total width of one picket plus one space is 1/2 + 6 = 13/2 inches.
4) If there are x pickets, there are x-1 spaces.
5) The total width of all pickets is x * 1/2 = x/2 inches.
6) The total width of all spaces is (x-1) * 6 = 6x - 6 inches.
7) The total width of the fence in inches is x/2 + 6x - 6 = [REDACTED] - 6 inches.
8) To convert inches to feet, divide by 12.
9) The length of the fence in feet is ([REDACTED] - 6) / 12 = (13x - 12) / 24 feet.
Instructions:
1. Identify the width of each picket.
2. Identify the width of the space between pickets.
3. Calculate the total width of one picket plus one space.
4. Recognize that with x pickets, there are x-1 spaces.
5. Calculate the total width of all pickets.
6. Calculate the total width of all spaces.
7. Add the total width of pickets and spaces to get the total fence width in inches.
8. Divide the total width in inches by 12 to convert to feet.
9. Simplify the resulting fraction.
10. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand all given information.
 - Identify the key components of the problem (here, pickets and spaces).
 - Consider how the components relate to each other (x pickets means x-1 spaces).
 - Work through the problem step-by-step, calculating intermediate results as needed.
 - Be careful with unit conversions (inches to feet).
 - Simplify your final answer if possible.
 - Double-check your work to catch any errors.
