Explanation:
I made an error in my calculations when solving the system of equations. Specifically, I made a mistake in step 4 when substituting the value of x from Equation 2 into Equation 1. This led me to incorrectly calculate the amount of money Sajal has, which in turn caused me to select the wrong answer.
Error Keywords:
 - Algebraic substitution error
 - Equation solving error
 - Calculation error
Solution:
Let's solve this problem again, step-by-step:
1. Let's assume Arjun has 'x' dollars and Sajal has 'y' dollars.
2. According to the first condition:
   If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
   Mathematically, y + 30 = 2(x - 30)
   Simplifying, y + 30 = 2x - 60
   y = 2x - 90 ... (Equation 1)
3. According to the second condition:
   If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.
   Mathematically, x + 10 = 3(y - 10)
   Simplifying, x + 10 = 3y - 30
   x = 3y - 40 ... (Equation 2)
4. Substitute the value of y from Equation 1 into Equation 2:
   x = 3(2x - 90) - 40
   x = 6x - 270 - 40
   x = 6x - 310
   5x = 310
   x = 62
5. Now, substitute x = 62 into Equation 1:
   y = 2(62) - 90
   y = 124 - 90
   y = 34
Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.
Instructions:
1. Identify the unknown variables and assign them symbols (e.g., x and y).
2. Write equations based on the given conditions.
3. Solve the equations by substituting one equation into the other.
4. Simplify the resulting equation to find the value of one variable.
5. Substitute this value into one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.
6. Double-check your calculations at each step to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated results.
