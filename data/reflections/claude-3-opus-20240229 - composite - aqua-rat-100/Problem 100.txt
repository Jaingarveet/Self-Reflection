Explanation:
I made an error in my calculation of the perimeter. I correctly set up the equations and solved for the length and breadth, but I made a mistake in the final step when calculating the perimeter. Instead of doubling the sum of the length and breadth, I should have added twice the length and twice the breadth.
Error Keywords:
 - Perimeter calculation error
 - Rectangle perimeter formula error
 - Arithmetic error
Solution:
1. Let the breadth of the rectangle be x meters.
2. Then, the length will be (4x + 1) meters.
3. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m. So, we can write:
   x(4x + 1) = 150
4. Expanding the equation:
   4x^2 + x - 150 = 0
5. Solving this quadratic equation:
   (4x - 15)(x + 10) = 0
   So, x = 15/4 or -10
   Since breadth can't be negative, x = 15/4 = 3.75 m
6. The length is 4x + 1 = 4(3.75) + 1 = 16 m
7. Perimeter of a rectangle is 2(length) + 2(breadth)
   = 2(16) + 2(3.75) 
   = 32 + 7.5
   = 39.5 m
8. Rounding 39.5 m to the nearest whole number gives 40 m.
The correct answer is 40 m, which corresponds to option [REDACTED].
Instructions:
1. Identify the unknown variable and assign it a letter (e.g., x for breadth).
2. Express the length in terms of the breadth using the given relationship.
3. Use the given area to set up an equation.
4. Expand the equation and solve for the unknown variable.
5. Calculate the length using the value of the breadth.
6. Use the correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l) + 2(b), where l is length and b is breadth.
7. Substitute the values of length and breadth into the perimeter formula.
8. Simplify the expression and round the result if necessary.
9. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and identify the given information and the unknown variable.
 - Use the given relationships to express one variable in terms of the other.
 - Set up equations based on the given information, such as area or perimeter formulas.
 - Solve the equations step-by-step, showing your work.
 - Remember the correct formulas for area and perimeter of a rectangle.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - If the answer choices are close in value, make sure to round your result appropriately.
