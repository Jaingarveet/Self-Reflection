Instructions:
1. Identify the rotation time for each ball.
2. Calculate the LCM of the rotation times for each ball.
3. Multiply the LCM by the number of full rotations for each ball.
4. Add the results from step 3 to get the total time for both balls to be at the same starting point again.
5. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
