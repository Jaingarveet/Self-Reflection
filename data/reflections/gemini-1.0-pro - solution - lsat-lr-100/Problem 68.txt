Solution:
The argument is based on the premise that if a stray cocker spaniel is found near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. This premise is based on the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined.
To evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods. If residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs, then the argument is stronger. This is because the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights is a more reliable indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in the neighborhood.
