Solution:
The argument claims that native speakers' perception of their own language as sequences of separate words is an illusion. 
This illusion is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.
The argument assumes that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
