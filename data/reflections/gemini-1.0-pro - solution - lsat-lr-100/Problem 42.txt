Solution:
The passage argues that accusing group members of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding is unhelpful because it is difficult to prove and rarely helps the group reach a resolution. 
However, the passage suggests that if one wants to make such an accusation stick, they should use the term "unyielding" because it is undeniable that someone who has not yielded is, in fact, unyielding. 
This conditional advocacy of a specific term is based on the idea that it provides a more logically sound and less offensive argument.
