Solution:
The argument in the context is a syllogism with the following structure:
* Premise 1: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience.
* Premise 2: Most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits.
* Conclusion: Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits.
The conclusion does not follow logically from the premises. The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
[REDACTED]: This argument also commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints does not follow logically from the premises.
[REDACTED]: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that few birds remain in this region during the winter follows logically from the premises.
[REDACTED]: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars does not follow logically from the premises.
[REDACTED]: This argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conclusion that most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring does not follow logically from the premises.
[REDACTED]: This argument is deductively valid. The conclusion that most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer follows logically from the premises.
Therefore, the pattern of flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in the argument in choice [REDACTED].
