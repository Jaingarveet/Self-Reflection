Solution:
The argument states that Hana said she was not going to invite her brothers to her birthday party.
The argument then states that among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest.
The argument then states that since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all.
The error in the argument is that it fails to establish that something true of some people (Hana's brothers who gave her the recording) is true of only those people (Hana's brothers who attended her party).
It is possible that Hana's brothers gave her the recording without attending the party.
