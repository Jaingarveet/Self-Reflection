Instructions:

1. Review the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings to determine the correct diagnosis.
2. Consider the possibility of nasal polyps as a diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.
3. Evaluate the patient for other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as rhinoscleroma, [REDACTED], or rhinosporidiosis.
4. Consult with a specialist, such as an otolaryngologist (ENT specialist), to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.
