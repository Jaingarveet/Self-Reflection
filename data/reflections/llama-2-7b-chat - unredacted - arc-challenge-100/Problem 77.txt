  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option A, which states that a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool will occur first. However, the correct answer is option B, which states that a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool will occur first.

The reasoning behind this is that the introduction of a new predator to the island will pose a threat to all of the sheep, regardless of their wool color. Therefore, the population of both dark and light wool sheep will decrease.
