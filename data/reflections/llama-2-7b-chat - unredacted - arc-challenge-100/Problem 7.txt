 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Speed calculation error
* Distance calculation error

Solution:
To find the distance traveled by the Canada geese on the first day, we need to use the formula: distance = speed x time.

The question states that the geese traveled 2,000 km in 40 days, so the speed of the geese is:
speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = 50 km/day

Now, to find the distance traveled on the first day, we can multiply the speed by the number of days the geese have been traveling:
distance = speed x days = 50 km/day x 1 day = 50 km

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 50 km.

Instructions:

1. Identify the formula for finding distance traveled: distance = speed x time
2. Use the given information to calculate the speed of the geese: speed = distance / time = 2,000 km / 40 days = 50 km/day
3. Calculate the distance traveled on the first day: distance = speed x days = 50 km/day x 1 day = 50 km
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Use the correct formula to solve the problem.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
