 Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question by selecting option D, "Look at the Sun only in the morning." However, the correct precaution to take when making observations of the Sun is option C, "Project image onto a piece of cardboard."

The reason for this is that looking directly at the Sun can cause serious eye damage, including solar retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. To avoid this risk, it is essential to use a specialized filter or projection method to view the Sun safely. Projecting the image of the Sun onto a piece of cardboard using a telescope or binoculars is a safe way to observe the Sun without damaging your eyes.

In contrast, option A, "Use only new equipment," is not a relevant precaution for observing the Sun. Option B, "Use a very strong telescope," may provide a clearer image of the Sun, but it does not address the safety issue of looking directly at the Sun. Option D, "Look at the Sun only in the morning," is also incorrect, as the Sun's position in the sky can change throughout the day, and it is not safe to look directly at the Sun at any time.

Instructions:

1. Identify the precaution that must be taken when making observations of the Sun.
2. Use a specialized filter or projection method to view the Sun safely.
3. Project the image of the Sun onto a piece of cardboard using a telescope or binoculars.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
Advice:

* Always prioritize safety when conducting scientific observations, especially when working with potentially hazardous materials or equipment.
* Take the time to thoroughly understand the scientific principles involved in the observation, and plan your approach accordingly.
* Use appropriate language and terminology when describing scientific concepts and procedures.
* Always double-check your calculations and final answer to ensure accuracy and precision.
