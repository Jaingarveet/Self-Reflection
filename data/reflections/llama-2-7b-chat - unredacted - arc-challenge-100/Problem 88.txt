 Explanation:
I selected option A, "perform the investigation in a different way," as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this option is not the best choice.

When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations. Option B, "change the hypothesis to match the results," is a more appropriate response in this situation.

Here's why:

Option A, "perform the investigation in a different way," may be necessary if the initial investigation was flawed or if there were limitations to the methodology that could have affected the results. However, if the results do not match the hypothesis, it is important to consider alternative explanations and revise the hypothesis accordingly.

Option C, "choose a different investigation," is not the best choice because it does not address the issue of the discrepancy between the results and the hypothesis.

Option D, "repeat the investigation," is a good choice because it allows Michelle to gather more data and potentially obtain more accurate results. However, it is important to note that repeating the investigation without addressing the issues with the initial investigation may lead to the same results.

In conclusion, the correct answer is option D, "repeat the investigation."

Advice:

* When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, it is important to critically evaluate the data and consider alternative explanations.
* Revising the hypothesis based on the results of the investigation is a crucial step in the scientific process.
* Gathering more data through repetition of the investigation can help to obtain more accurate results.
* It is important to be systematic and thorough in the investigation to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
