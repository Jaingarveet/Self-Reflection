 Explanation:
I correctly identified the similarity between the small and large samples of aluminum, which is that both samples have a definite volume. However, I made an error in my reasoning.

The correct answer is (B) a definite volume. Both the small and large samples of aluminum have a definite volume, meaning they have a specific amount of space occupied by their atoms. The number of atoms in both samples is the same, so option (C) is incorrect. The small sample and the large sample do not have the same shape, so option (A) is incorrect. The large sample has a greater volume than the small sample, so option (D) is incorrect.

Error Keywords:

* Volume
* Atoms
* Shape

Solution:
The small sample of aluminum and the large sample of aluminum have the same volume.
The number of atoms in both samples is the same.
The small sample and the large sample do not have the same shape.
The large sample has a greater volume than the small sample.

Instructions:

1. Identify the similarity between the small and large samples of aluminum.
