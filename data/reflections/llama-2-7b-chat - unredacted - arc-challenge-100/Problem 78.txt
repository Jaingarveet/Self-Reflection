 Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly by selecting option B, "It acts as a barrier." While the skin does act as a barrier to protect the body from external factors, it is not the correct reason why the skin is considered an organ.

The correct answer is option C, "It is made of tissues." The skin is made up of several layers of tissues, including the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, which work together to perform various functions such as protecting the body, regulating body temperature, and facilitating sensation.
