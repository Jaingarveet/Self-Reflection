  Explanation:

As an expert in Science, I understand that environmental issues are a crucial concern for students who are interested in this field. Among the options provided, the best choice for a student interested in environmental issues is (D) replacing human workers with robots.

This is because robots can help reduce the environmental impact of industries by minimizing waste and energy consumption associated with human labor. For example, robots can be designed to operate more efficiently and with less waste than human workers, leading to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental harmful effects.

In contrast, (A) making cars run on less fuel is a good step towards reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change, but it may not have a significant impact on the overall environmental footprint of the transportation sector. (B) finding more sites for copper mines may contribute to the degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems, as well as the depletion of non-renewable resources. (C) making ocean liners bigger and faster may lead to increased fuel consumption and emissions, which can exacerbate environmental problems such as climate change and ocean pollution.

Therefore, option (D) replacing human workers with robots is the best choice for a student interested in environmental issues.
