  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. The correct answer is (D) 186 pounds and 84 kilograms.

The weight of an astronaut on the Moon is indeed different from their mass on Earth, as the Moon has a much weaker gravitational pull than the Earth. The weight of an object on the Moon is approximately 1/6 of its mass on Earth, due to the Moon's lower gravity.

So, if the astronaut's mass on Earth is 84 kilograms, their weight on the Moon would be approximately 13.3 kilograms (186 pounds / 6 = 13.3 kilograms).

Keywords: weight, mass, gravity, Moon, Earth.

Instructions:

1. Understand the concept of weight and mass in different gravitational environments.
2. Calculate the weight of an object on the Moon based on its mass and the Moon's gravity.
3. Convert between units of weight and mass.
4. Apply the concept of gravity to different celestial bodies.
5. Double-check calculations to ensure accuracy.

Advice:

* Always use the correct units when solving problems.
* Be aware of the gravitational environment of different celestial bodies.
* Use the concept of gravity to solve problems involving weight and mass.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
