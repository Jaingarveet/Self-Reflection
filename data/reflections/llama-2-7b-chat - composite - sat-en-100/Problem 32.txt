Solution:

1. Read the table and identify the soil samples that were disturbed in darkness. These are Samples [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].
2. Count the number of seedlings that emerged in each of these samples. The results are:
	* Sample [REDACTED]: 0 seedlings
	* Sample [REDACTED]: 1 seedling
	* Sample [REDACTED]: 2 seedlings
	* Sample [REDACTED]: 3 seedlings
3. The fewest number of seedlings that emerged in a soil sample disturbed in darkness is 1, which is the number of seedlings that emerged in Sample [REDACTED]. Therefore, the answer is (B) Sample [REDACTED].
