Instructions:
1. Understand that a line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx.
2. Calculate the slope of the line determined by the given points.
3. Set up an equation equating the calculated slope to k/2, since the line passes through the origin.
[REDACTED]. Solve the equation to find the value of k.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
