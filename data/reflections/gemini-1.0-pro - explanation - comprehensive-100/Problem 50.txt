Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the author's stance on the relationship between plants and insects. 
My error stemmed from misinterpreting the passage's emphasis on the role of insects in driving the development of secondary substances. 
While the passage acknowledges this role, it also explicitly states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects. 
Instead, the passage emphasizes that insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species by favoring those that provide them with a selective advantage.
