Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the slope of a line passing through the origin is always undefined. 
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the concept of slope and how it relates to the origin. 
I knew how to calculate the slope, but I did not consider the special case of a line passing through the origin.
