Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the answer that most seriously weakens the argument. 
My error was in focusing on the likelihood of being a victim of violent crime rather than the number of violent crimes. 
The correct answer weakens the argument by showing that the increase in reported violent crimes may not be due to an actual increase in violent crime but rather an increase in reporting.
