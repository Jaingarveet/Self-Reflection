Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the argument implies that currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. However, the argument only states that most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. This does not necessarily imply anything about their current commute times.
