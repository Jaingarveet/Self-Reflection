Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the absurdity of the conclusion invalidated the logical derivation. 
However, the absurdity of the conclusion only indicates that one of the premises must be false. 
I failed to identify the correct premise that needs to be false to avoid the absurd conclusion.
