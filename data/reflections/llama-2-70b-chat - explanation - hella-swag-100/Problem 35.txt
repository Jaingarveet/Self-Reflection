Explanation:
The text discusses the importance of adding texture to white bedding. Option [REDACTED] provides a coherent and relevant continuation of the text by suggesting that a white blanket or comforter with a stitched pattern can add texture to the bed. It also offers a specific example of a pattern, such as wavy lines, roses, stars, or leaves, which can add visual interest to the bedding.

Option [REDACTED] mentions pillows and blankets, but it does not directly relate to the topic of adding texture to white bedding. Option [REDACTED] suggests solid color bedding, which may not provide the same level of texture as patterned bedding. Option [REDACTED] is not a coherent completion of the text, as it mentions a constant patterned pattern or making columns about using linens, which is not related to the topic of adding texture to white bedding.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
