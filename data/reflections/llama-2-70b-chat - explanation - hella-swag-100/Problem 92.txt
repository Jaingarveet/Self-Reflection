Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the young man would need help solving the rubix cube, or that he would show off his solved cube while still speaking to the camera.
I missed the fact that the young man was seen speaking to the camera, indicating that he was being filmed, and that he would want to show off his solving skills by panning the camera back to show his time.
