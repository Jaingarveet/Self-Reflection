Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the competitors would acknowledge the crowd after their performance.
However, the text states that they receive a score after their lift, which suggests that the competition is still ongoing.
Therefore, it is more likely that the competitors would wait until the competition is over to acknowledge the crowd.
