 Explanation:
I correctly identified the quadratic equation as $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$ and factored it to isolate $a$. However, I made an error in my calculation of the value of $d$.

Error Keywords:

* Factoring error
* Calculation error
* Coordinate error

Solution:
The quadratic equation $y = a(x-2)(x+4)$ can be factored as $y = a(x-2)(x+4) = a(x-2)(0 + 4) = a(x-2)4$. Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(c, d)$, we can set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the quadratic equation and factor it to isolate $a$.
2. Set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.
3. Identify the vertex of the parabola and calculate the value of $d$.
4. Choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Advice:

* Always check your work by setting the equation to $y = 0$ and solving for $x$.
* Be careful when factoring quadratic expressions to ensure that you are factoring correctly.
* Use the correct coordinate system when plotting the graph of the parabola.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
