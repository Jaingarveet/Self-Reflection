  Explanation:
The table lists the lengths of 21 brown bullhead fish, with the measurements ranging from 8 to 11 inches. The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error, and removing it from the data will change the values of the mean, median, and range.

The mean is calculated by adding up all the measurements and dividing by the number of observations. If the 24-inch measurement is removed, the mean will decrease, as there will be one fewer large measurement in the dataset.

The median is the middle value in the dataset when the measurements are arranged in order. If the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median will also decrease, as there will be one fewer large measurement in the dataset.

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest measurements in the dataset. If the 24-inch measurement is removed, the range will decrease, as the largest measurement will be 11 inches, which is smaller than 24 inches.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Range.

Advice:

* When dealing with outliers, it's important to identify them and handle them appropriately. In this case, the outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error and should be removed from the data.
* When calculating the mean, median, and range, it's important to use the correct formula and to arrange the measurements in the correct order.
* When dealing with a dataset that contains outliers, it's important to consider how the outliers will affect the calculations of the mean, median, and range.
* When calculating the mean, median, and range, it's important to use the correct formula and to arrange the measurements in the correct order.
