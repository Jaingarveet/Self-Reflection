 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my solution to the equation $\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2$.

The correct solution is:

$$\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2 \Rightarrow x^{2} - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x^{2} = 2 \Rightarrow x = \pm 1$$

So, the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x = 1$ and $x = -1$.

Error Keywords:

* Factoring error
* Simplification error
* Calculation error

Solution:

1. Start with the given equation: $\frac{x^{2}-1}{x-1} = -2$
2. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation by multiplying both sides by $x-1$, which gives us $x^{2} - 2 = 0$
3. Factor the left-hand side of the equation as $x^{2} - 2 = (x + 1)(x - 2) = 0$
4. Solve for $x$ by setting each factor equal to $0$ and solving for $x$
5. Check the solutions to ensure they satisfy the original equation

Instructions:

1. Always simplify and factor equations before solving them.
2. Check your work by verifying that the solutions satisfy the original equation.
3. Be careful when factoring and simplifying equations, as small mistakes can lead to large errors.
4. Use the correct order of operations when solving equations.
5. Double-check your calculations and ensure that they are accurate.

Advice:

* Always approach math problems with a clear and organized mindset.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Use visual aids, such as graphs or diagrams, to help you understand the problem and find the solution.
* Practice regularly to improve your math skills and build confidence.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
