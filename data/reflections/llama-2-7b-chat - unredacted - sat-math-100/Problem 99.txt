 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my answer. I incorrectly identified the value of $f(-1)$.

The correct calculation is:

$$f(-1) = \frac{-1 + 3}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$$

So, the correct answer is (C) $f(-1) = -2$.

Error Keywords:

* Plugging in incorrect values
* Miscalculation
* Error in simplification

Solution:

To find the value of $f(-1)$, we need to plug $-1$ into the formula for $f(x)$:

$$f(-1) = \frac{-1 + 3}{2}$$

Step-by-step calculation:

1. Subtract $3$ from $-1$ to get $2$.
2. Divide by $2$ to simplify the fraction.

Therefore, $f(-1) = -2$.

Instructions:

1. Identify the function $f(x)$ and its formula.
2. Plug in the value $-1$ into the formula for $f(x)$.
3. Simplify the fraction and calculate the result.
4. Double-check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always check your work by plugging in different values and verifying the results.
* Be careful when simplifying fractions, as small mistakes can lead to incorrect answers.
* Make sure to read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
