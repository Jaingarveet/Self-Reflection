  Great job! You correctly identified the correct answer as (A): $P = \frac{\left(\frac{r}{1,200}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}}{\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}-1} m$.

Here's why:

You correctly recognized that the formula is a proportion, and you simplified it by multiplying both sides by $\left(1+\frac{r}{1,200}\right)^{N}$. This resulted in isolating $P$ on the right-hand side of the equation.

Well done!

Now, let's review the process you used to arrive at the correct answer:

1. You read the question carefully and identified the key elements of the problem, including the formula and the given values.
2. You broke down the formula into simpler parts and analyzed each part separately.
3. You used algebraic manipulation to simplify the formula and isolate $P$.
4. You checked your work by plugging in the values given in the question and verifying that the result matched the correct answer.

Great job! Keep practicing, and you'll become even better at solving math problems.
