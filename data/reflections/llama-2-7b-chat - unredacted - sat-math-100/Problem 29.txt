  Explanation:
You are correct that the weight of an object on a planet can be found using the formula $W = mg$, where $W$ is the weight of the object measured in newtons, $m$ is the mass of the object measured in kilograms, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet measured in $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.

However, in this problem, you made an error in your calculation. You calculated the weight of the object on Earth as $150 \times 9.8$ m/s$^2$, which is incorrect. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is actually 9.8 m/s$^2$, not 9.8 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.

So, the weight of the object on Earth would be $150 \times 9.8$ N/kg, not $150 \times 9.8$ m/s$^2$.

Now, let's solve the problem again:

The object has a weight of 150 newtons on Earth. We want to find the planet where the object would have an approximate weight of 170 newtons.

From the table, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity on Venus is 8.9 m/s$^2$. So, the weight of the object on Venus would be:

$W = mg$
$= 150$ N
$= 150 \times 8.9$ m/s$^2$
$= 1365$ N/kg

Since the weight of the object on Venus is closer to 170 newtons than any other planet, the answer is (B) Venus.

Advice:

* Always check your calculations carefully, especially when working with units.
* Make sure you understand the units of each quantity and how they are related.
* Use the correct formula for the problem, and make sure you are using the correct units for each quantity.
* Double-check your work to ensure accuracy.
