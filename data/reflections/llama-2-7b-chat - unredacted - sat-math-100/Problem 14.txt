  Explanation:

The table provided shows a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, where each increase in $x$ is associated with a decrease in $y$. To represent this relationship mathematically, we can write the equation:

$y = -2x$

This equation shows that for every unit increase in $x$, $y$ decreases by 2 units.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B): $x + 2y = 5a$.
