 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I correctly set up the equation $y = kx$ and substituted $x = 6$ to get $y = 12$. However, I then made an error in my calculation by assuming that the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ would be the same as when $x = 6$.

The correct solution is:

If $y = kx$ and $y = 24$ when $x = 6$, then we can set up the equation:

$$y = kx$$

Substituting $x = 5$, we get:

$$y = k(5)$$

Which gives us:

$$y = 10$$

So, the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ is $10$.

Error Keywords:

* Miscalculation
* Assumption
* Incorrect reasoning

Advice:

* Always double-check your calculations and assumptions.
* Make sure you are using the correct value of $k$.
* Consider the value of $y$ when $x = 5$ to be $10$.
* Be careful when substituting values into the equation.
