  Explanation:

Great job! You correctly identified the value of $k$ that will result in no solution for the system of equations.

To explain why your answer is correct, let's go through the steps you took:

1. You solved the first equation for $x$ to get $x = \frac{4k}{3} + \frac{7}{3}y$.
2. You substituted this expression for $x$ into the second equation, which gave you an inconsistent equation: $\frac{16k}{9} + \frac{21}{3}y = 7$.
3. You recognized that if $k = -\frac{16}{7}$, then the equation will be inconsistent, as $\frac{16k}{9} = -\frac{16}{7}$ and $\frac{21}{3}y = 7$.
4. Therefore, you concluded that the value of $k$ that will result in no solution is $k = -\frac{16}{7}$.

Great job! Your reasoning and calculations are correct.

As for the other options, here's why they are incorrect:

A) $\frac{12}{5}$ is not a value of $k$ that will result in no solution. In fact, this value of $k$ will result in a consistent system of equations.

B) $\frac{16}{7}$ is also not a value of $k$ that will result in no solution.

C) $-\frac{16}{7}$ is the correct value of $k$ that will result in no solution.

D) $-\frac{12}{5}$ is not a value of $k$ that will result in no solution. In fact, this value of $k$ will result in a consistent system of equations.

Great job on this question! Keep up the good work.
