 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly assumed that if Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, then the production of Type B trees was 80% of the production of Type A trees. However, this is not the correct conclusion.

The correct reasoning is:
If Type A trees produced 20% more pears than Type B trees, then the production of Type B trees is 100% - 20% = 80% of the production of Type A trees.

So, if the Type A trees produced 144 pears, the Type B trees produced 80% of that amount, which is:
144 x 0.8 = 115 pears

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 115 pears.
