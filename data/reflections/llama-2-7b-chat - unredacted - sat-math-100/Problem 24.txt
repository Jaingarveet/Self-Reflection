 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly solved the problem and provided an answer that is incorrect.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding the problem
* Incorrect calculation
* Lack of attention to detail

Solution:
To find the value of $n$ such that $|n-1| + 1 = 0$, we need to isolate the absolute value of $n-1$ on one side of the equation and then add 1 to both sides.

Step-by-step solution:

1. Isolate the absolute value of $n-1$ on one side of the equation by using the absolute value symbol: $|n-1| = n-1$.
2. Add 1 to both sides of the equation: $n-1 + 1 = n$.
3. Simplify the equation: $n = 2$.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) There is no such value of $n$.

Instructions:

1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Work through each step of the solution carefully and accurately.
4. Double-check your calculations and final answer.
