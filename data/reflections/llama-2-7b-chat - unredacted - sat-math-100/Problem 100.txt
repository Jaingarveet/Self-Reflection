  Explanation:

You are correct that the speed of a sound wave is directly proportional to the inverse of the air temperature, as given by the formula $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$. To find the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second, we need to set this expression equal to 1,000 and solve for $t$.

However, there is a mistake in your solution. You correctly solved for $t$ to be $-47.5^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, but you then incorrectly answered that the correct answer is (C).

The correct answer is (B): $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Here's why:

When we set $a = 1,052 + 1.08t$ equal to 1,000, we get:

$1,052 + 1.08t = 1,000$

Solving for $t$, we get:

$t = -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

Therefore, the air temperature at which the speed of the sound wave will be closest to 1,000 feet per second is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Great job on recognizing the direct proportional relationship between the speed of a sound wave and the inverse of the air temperature!
