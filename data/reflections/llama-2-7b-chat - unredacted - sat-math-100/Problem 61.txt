  Thank you for providing the problem and the correct answer! I'll make sure to format my answer correctly in the future.

To answer the question, we can use the formula:

W = mg

Where W is the weight in newtons (N), m is the mass of the object in kilograms (kg), and g is the acceleration due to gravity on the planet in meters per second squared (m/s^2).

From the table, we can see that the acceleration due to gravity on Mercury is 3.6 m/s^2.

So, to find the weight of an object on Mercury with a mass of 90 kg, we can plug in the values:

W = 90 kg x 3.6 m/s^2 = 324 N

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 324 N.
