  Thank you for providing the solution to the problem. However, I noticed that you did not format your answer correctly. To help you improve your response, I will provide you with some feedback and suggestions.

Feedback:

* Your answer should be stated in the format of "Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")", where [ANSWER_CHOICE] is the letter of the correct answer choice.
* You did not provide a clear explanation of how you arrived at your answer, which makes it difficult for me to understand your thought process.
* You did not use any specific keywords or phrases to describe your errors, which makes it challenging for me to identify the areas where you went wrong.

Suggestions:

* In the future, please make sure to format your answer correctly by stating it in the format of "Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")".
* Provide a clear explanation of how you arrived at your answer, including any steps or calculations you used.
* Use specific keywords or phrases to describe your errors, such as "calculation error", "arithmetic mistake", or "miscalculation". This will help me identify the areas where you went wrong and provide more accurate feedback.

Based on your response, the correct answer is (B): 250 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
