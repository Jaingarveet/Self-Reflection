 Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning and calculation. I incorrectly identified the coordinates of the $x$-intercepts and applied the wrong formula to find the distance between them.

Error Keywords:

* Misidentification of coordinates
* Incorrect formula application

Solution:
The correct coordinates of the $x$-intercepts are (2, 9) and (4, 10).

Using the formula:
Distance = √(y2 - y1)

Distance between the $x$-intercepts = √(10 - 9) = √1 = 1

Therefore, the correct answer is (C).

Instructions:

1. Identify the coordinates of the $x$-intercepts of the graph of $f(x) = x^{2} + 5x + 4$.
2. Use the formula: Distance = √(y2 - y1) to find the distance between the $x$-intercepts.
3. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
4. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Advice:

* Always carefully identify the coordinates of the points in a problem.
* Always use the correct formula and apply it correctly.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
