Advice:
 - Always read questions thoroughly to grasp what they are truly asking. Look for key phrases like "best describes" or "most likely explains".
 - Make sure you have a clear understanding of scientific terms and classifications before attempting to answer a question. 
 - When examining mixtures, focus on the properties of the individual components and how they interact, not just the number of components.
 - Remember, in a mixture the substances retain their properties, while in a compound the substances chemically combine to form a new substance with different properties.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are factually wrong, then deeply analyze the remaining choices to determine which one best answers the specific question asked.
