Advice:
 - Always consider the difference between inherited traits (determined by genes) and characteristics influenced by the environment.
 - Remember that while environmental factors can influence the expression of traits, the underlying genetic ability is what's inherited.
 - Carefully read and consider each answer choice before making a selection.
 - If unsure, try to reason out why each choice might or might not be an inherited trait.
 - Don't assume that just because a characteristic varies with environmental conditions, it cannot be an inherited trait.
