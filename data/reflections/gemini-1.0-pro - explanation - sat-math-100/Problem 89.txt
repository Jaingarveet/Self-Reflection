Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the total area covered by 48 ounces of graphene. I correctly calculated the number of football fields that 48 ounces of graphene could cover, but I then incorrectly multiplied that number by the area of a single football field. I should have multiplied by the area of 48 football fields.
