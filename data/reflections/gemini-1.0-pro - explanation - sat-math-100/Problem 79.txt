Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the slope and y-intercept of the linear equation that represents the helicopter's altitude. 
I correctly identified the rate of change (21 feet per second) as the slope, but I mistakenly used the initial altitude (40 feet) as the y-intercept instead of the initial time (0 seconds).
