Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for distance traveled:
Distance = Time x Speed
2. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled to [REDACTED]:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / 70 x 70
3. Use the formula to calculate the distance traveled back to [REDACTED]:
Distance = [REDACTED] - [REDACTED] / [REDACTED] x [REDACTED]
4. Calculate the total distance traveled:
Total distance = Distance to [REDACTED] + Distance back to A
5. Check your answer against the given choices.
