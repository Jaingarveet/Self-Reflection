Instructions:
1. Identify the formula for the length of an object passing a point: L = vt.
2. Identify the total speed of the object: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
3. Substitute the values into the formula: L = 195 m/s x 5 s.
4. Solve for L: L = 9[REDACTED].
5. Compare the calculated length to the given choices and select the corresponding answer.
