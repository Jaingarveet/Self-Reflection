Instructions:
1. Identify the variables in the problem: number of workers, hours worked per day, and number of days.
2. Write down the equation for work: W = (number of workers) x (hours worked per day) x (number of days)
3. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by x men working x hours per day in x days: W1 = x^3
4. Use the equation to find the amount of work done by y men working y hours per day in y days: W2 = y^3
5. Calculate the ratio of W2 to W1: W2/W1 = y^3 / x^3
6. Simplify the ratio by canceling out common factors: y^3 / x^3 = y^3 / x^2
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
