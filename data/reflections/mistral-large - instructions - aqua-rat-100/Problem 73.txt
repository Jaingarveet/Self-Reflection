Instructions:
1. Identify the percentages given in the problem.
2. Convert the percentages to fractions.
3. Determine the smallest number that satisfies both fractions (i.e., is a multiple of both denominators).
4. Check if the number obtained in step 3 is greater than the minimum number of students given in the problem.
5. If the number obtained in step 3 is not greater than the minimum number of students, find the next multiple of both denominators that is greater than the minimum number of students.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
