Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I didn't consider the possibility of ships being designed to adapt to the current height of the bridge. I focused on the current traffic of large ships, rather than considering the potential for technological solutions.

- Technological solutions
Solution:
The expert's point of view is that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt to allow for the passage of larger ships. However, if shipbuilding technology is highly developed and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan, this would raise doubts about the necessity of demolishing and rebuilding the bridge. This suggests that it is possible to design ships that can navigate the river without the need for altering the bridge.
