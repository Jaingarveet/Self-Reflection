Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the logic behind the question. I assumed that any statement that placed Li Si's bonus higher or equal to Wang Wu's would contradict the inference, but this was not the case. The correct answer was A, which states that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's. This assumption does not necessarily make the inference hold, as it does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Inference error
Solution:
The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. This is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. Therefore, any assumption that does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses would not necessarily make the inference hold. The assumption that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's (Choice A) does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses, and therefore does not necessarily make the inference hold.
Instructions:
1. Understand the inference made in the question.
2. Identify the relationships between the different individuals' bonuses.
3. Evaluate each assumption and determine whether it directly relates to the inference.
4. Choose the assumption that does not necessarily make the inference hold.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the inference being made.
- Break down the relationships between different elements in the question.
- Evaluate each assumption individually and in relation to the inference.
- Remember that not all assumptions directly relate to the inference being made.
