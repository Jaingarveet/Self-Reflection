Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question's requirement. The question asked for the option that would weaken the argument most. While my chosen answer (B) does provide a potential explanation for the increase in posts, it does not directly challenge the argument's validity. The correct answer (D) weakens the argument by suggesting that the forum is a legal forum, implying that the posts may not accurately reflect the overall social atmosphere.
Error Keywords:

Solution:
The argument is based on the increase in posts about certain social issues, interpreting it as a sign of social deterioration. The correct answer (D) weakens the argument by suggesting that the forum is a legal forum, implying that the posts may not accurately reflect the overall social atmosphere. This is because legal forums often have rules and regulations that can influence the type and tone of posts, which may not be representative of broader societal views.
