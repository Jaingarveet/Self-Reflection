Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I failed to infer the implicit conflict of interest between the boss and the employees based on the information provided. The statement implies that the boss's profit and the employees' wages are inversely related, which suggests a potential conflict of interest if the employees do not hold shares in the enterprise.
Error Keywords:
- Inference error
- Logic error
- Interpretation error
Solution:
The statement implies that the boss's profit and the employees' wages are inversely related. This suggests a potential conflict of interest between the boss and the employees. If the employees do not hold shares in the enterprise, they would not benefit from the boss's profit, which could lead to conflicts of interest. Therefore, the conclusion most strongly supported by the statement is "If the employee does not have shares in the enterprise, the boss and the employee will have conflicts of interest."
Instructions:
1. Read the statement carefully and understand the relationship between the variables.
2. Identify the implicit implications of the statement.
3. Evaluate each conclusion based on the information and implications of the statement.
4. Choose the conclusion that is most strongly supported by the statement.
Advice:
- Always read the statement carefully and understand the relationship between the variables.
- Try to infer the implicit implications of the statement.
- Evaluate each conclusion based on the information and implications of the statement, not on external assumptions.
- Choose the conclusion that is most strongly supported by the statement, even if it is not explicitly stated.
