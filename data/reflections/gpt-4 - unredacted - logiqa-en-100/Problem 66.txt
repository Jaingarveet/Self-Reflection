Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked one possible arrangement. I failed to consider that E and I could be adjacent in two different ways (E-I or I-E), and this led to an underestimation of the total number of possible arrangements.
Error Keywords:
- Overlooking possibilities
- Arrangement error
- Combinatorial error
Solution:
Given the conditions:
1. F is to the north of H (F-H)
2. I and E are adjacent (I-E or E-I)
3. G is to the north of F and is the northernmost island.
The possible arrangements are:
1. G-F-H-I-E
2. G-F-H-E-I
3. G-F-I-H-E
4. G-F-I-E-H
Instructions:
1. Understand the given conditions and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed positions based on the conditions.
3. Identify the variables that can change positions.
4. List all possible arrangements considering the conditions and constraints.
5. Count the total number of possible arrangements.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller parts.
- Consider all possible arrangements or combinations.
- Double-check your solutions to ensure you haven't missed any possibilities.
- Practice more problems on arrangements and combinations to improve your skills.
