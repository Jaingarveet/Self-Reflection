Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the nature of the argument. The argument was about the increase in Chinese investment in US real estate being due to more rich people in China transferring their property abroad. I chose an answer that provided a different reason for the increase in Chinese investment, but it did not directly counter the argument about wealth transfer.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Argument analysis error
- Counter-argument identification error
Solution:
The argument is that there are more and more rich people in China who are transferring their property abroad. The best counter-argument would be one that provides a different reason for the increase in Chinese investment in US real estate, but also directly counters the argument about wealth transfer. 
Option B: "There are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai" provides a different reason for the increase in Chinese investment (speculation rather than wealth transfer), thus it is the best counter-argument.
