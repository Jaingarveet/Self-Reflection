Advice:
- Carefully read and understand the original constraint before evaluating the alternative constraints.
- Identify the effect of the original constraint and use it as a guide to evaluate the alternative constraints.
- Consider the relationship between the candidates and how the alternative constraints affect their assignments.
- Eliminate alternative constraints that do not have the same effect as the original constraint.
- Double-check your answer to ensure that it has the same effect as the original constraint.
