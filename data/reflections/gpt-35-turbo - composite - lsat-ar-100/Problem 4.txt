Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all the constraints in the problem. 
The problem states that [REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s. 
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] must lead the Wednesday session. 
If [REDACTED] leads the Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] must lead the Thursday session, which violates the constraint that [REDACTED]'s session must meet on an earlier day of the week than [REDACTED]'s. 
Therefore, [REDACTED] must lead the Wednesday session, and [REDACTED] must lead the Thursday session.

Solution:
Instructions:
1. Identify the constraints in the problem.
2. Identify the possible scenarios based on the constraints.
3. Analyze each scenario to determine which one satisfies all the constraints.
4. Choose the answer that matches the scenario that satisfies all the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints.
 - Always consider all the constraints when analyzing the problem.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure that it satisfies all the constraints.
 - Remember that each constraint is important and must be satisfied to solve the problem.
