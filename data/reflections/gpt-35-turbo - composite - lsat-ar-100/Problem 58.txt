Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the bay holding [REDACTED] must be in bay 5 or 6. However, the problem only states that the bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED], but it does not specify which bays they are in. Therefore, my assumption was incorrect, and my subsequent reasoning was also incorrect.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misinterpretation of problem statement
 - Logical error
Solution:
Bay 4 is adjacent to the bay holding [REDACTED].
The bay holding [REDACTED] has a higher number than the bay holding [REDACTED].
The bay holding [REDACTED] must be in bay 3 or 5.
If bay 3 holds [REDACTED], then bay 4 holds [REDACTED], and bay 5 holds [REDACTED].
If bay 5 holds [REDACTED], then bay 4 holds [REDACTED], and bay 3 holds [REDACTED].
Therefore, [REDACTED] cannot be held in bay 4.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem statement carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the relationships between the bays and the types of cargo.
3. Use the given information to deduce the possible types of cargo in each bay.
4. Use logical reasoning to eliminate the impossible types of cargo in each bay.
5. Double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem statement carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Always identify the relationships between the variables in the problem.
 - Always use the given information to deduce the possible solutions.
 - Always use logical reasoning to eliminate the impossible solutions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that assumptions should be avoided unless explicitly stated in the problem.
