Explanation:
My mistake was in not considering all possible scenarios. 
I only considered the scenario where P is the only zoologist selected, but I did not consider the other conditions. 
I also misinterpreted the question stem. 
The question asks which statement must be true, not which statement could be true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete analysis
 - Misinterpretation
 - Insufficient consideration of conditions
Solution:
If P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected as a botanist and either K, L, or M must be selected as a chemist. 
If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. 
If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. 
F and K cannot both be selected. 
K and M cannot both be selected. 
Statement [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because if G is selected, then K can still be selected. 
Statement [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then L can still be selected. 
Statement [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because if L or M is selected, then K does not have to be selected. 
Statement [REDACTED] must be true because if two chemists are selected, and F is not one of them, then K and L or K and M must be selected. If K and M cannot both be selected, then F cannot be selected. 
Statement [REDACTED] is not necessarily true because if H is selected, then both K and L can still be selected.
