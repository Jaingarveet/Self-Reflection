Explanation:
My mistake was in assuming that F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves if G is placed on the top shelf. However, the problem only states that at least two books are placed on each shelf, not that all books are placed on the shelves. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because if G is placed on the top shelf, then F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves. I is placed on the middle shelf, so K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf. F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be placed on the bottom shelf as well. Therefore, the books placed on the middle shelf are I, K, and L.
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading the problem
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Logical error
Solution:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, [REDACTED], K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
I is placed on the middle shelf, so K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be placed on the bottom shelf as well.
Therefore, the books placed on the middle shelf are I, K, and L.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
2. Identify the books that must be placed on the bottom shelf based on the constraints.
3. Identify the book that must be placed on the middle shelf based on the constraints.
4. Use the remaining books to determine the possible combinations for the top shelf.
5. For each possible combination of books on the top shelf, use the constraints to determine the books on the middle and bottom shelves.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand the constraints.
 - Never assume anything that is not explicitly stated in the problem.
 - Always use the constraints to eliminate impossible combinations and determine possible combinations.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that logical reasoning is essential in solving problems.
