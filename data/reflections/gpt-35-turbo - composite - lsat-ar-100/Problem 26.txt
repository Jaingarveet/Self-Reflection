Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Wayne must perform a traditional piece in the second or fifth solo. However, the question only asks for the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece. Since the third solo is a traditional piece, Wayne can perform a modern piece in all five solos, and the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the question
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Misreading the problem
Solution:
The third solo is a traditional piece, and exactly [REDACTED] of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least [REDACTED] modern piece. Therefore, Wayne can perform a modern piece in all five solos, and the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is [REDACTED].
