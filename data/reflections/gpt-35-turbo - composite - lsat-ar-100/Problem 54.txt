Explanation:
My reasoning was incorrect because I did not consider all possible combinations of plays that each student could review. 
I assumed that Kramer and O'Neill must review Sunset and Undulation, but this is not necessarily true. 
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Insufficient consideration of possibilities
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
If Jiang does not review Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Tamerlane and one other play. 
Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so they must review only one play each. 
Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, Jiang cannot review Sunset or Tamerlane. 
Therefore, Jiang must review Undulation. 
If Kramer and Lopez each review only one play, and neither of them reviews Sunset or Tamerlane, then they must review Tamerlane and Undulation in some order. 
Therefore, O'Neill must review Sunset, and Megregian must review Sunset and Tamerlane. 
Thus, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
