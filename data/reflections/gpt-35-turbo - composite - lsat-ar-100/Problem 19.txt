Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and did not consider all possible scenarios. 
I assumed that George would give the afternoon report on Tuesday, but he could give the morning report instead. 
I also did not consider the possibility that Nina might not give a report at all. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
 - Incorrect assumption
Solution:
If Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports, then George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert must give the afternoon reports.
George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give the morning or afternoon report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports.
Therefore, Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday, but not both.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and make sure you understand all the conditions.
2. Consider all possible scenarios and outcomes.
3. Make a list of all the students who must give reports and on which days.
4. Consider the different possibilities for when George can give his report.
5. Consider the different possibilities for when Nina can give her report.
6. Determine which students must give reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
7. Determine which students must give morning reports and which must give afternoon reports.
8. Use the process of elimination to determine which answer choice must be true.
