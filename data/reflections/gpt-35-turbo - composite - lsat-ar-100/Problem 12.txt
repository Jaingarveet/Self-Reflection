Explanation:
I incorrectly chose [REDACTED] as the answer because I did not consider all of the rules. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED] because J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be shown consecutively with any other house. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of rules
 - Overlooking rules
 - Incorrect reasoning
Solution:
J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be shown consecutively with any other house. 
K cannot be shown in the morning, so it cannot be shown consecutively with any other house in the morning. 
L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so it cannot be shown consecutively with K or M. 
O is not mentioned in any of the rules. 
Therefore, the pair of houses that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is [REDACTED].
