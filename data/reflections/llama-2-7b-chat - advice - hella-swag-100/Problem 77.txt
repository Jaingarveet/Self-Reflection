Advice:

* Always soak your feet in warm water and mild soap for at least 30 minutes to soften the skin and make it easier to remove calluses.
* Use a pumice stone or foot file to gently scrub the calluses and remove the dead skin.
* Be gentle when removing calluses to avoid irritating the skin.
* Keep the skin on your feet moisturized to prevent calluses from forming.
* Consider adding some dish soap to your foot bath to get your feet properly soaked.
