Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I isolated x by subtracting 0.20y from both sides of the equation, but then I made a mistake in simplifying the equation.
I incorrectly substituted y = [REDACTED] into the equation, which led to an incorrect solution.
