Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the given information. 
I thought that the values of $f(x)$ in the table were the coefficients of the polynomial, 
but they are actually the values of $f(x)$ at certain points.
I also misunderstood the question, thinking it was asking for the factor of $f(x)$ at $x=2$, 
when it was actually asking for a factor of $f(x)$ in general.
