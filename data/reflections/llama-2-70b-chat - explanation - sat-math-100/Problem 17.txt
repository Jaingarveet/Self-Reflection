Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly cancelled out the $[REDACTED]$s in the numerator and denominator, leading me to conclude that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$. The correct solution is to recognize that $\frac{a}{b} = [REDACTED]$ means that $a = [REDACTED]b$, and therefore, $\frac{[REDACTED]b}{a} = \frac{[REDACTED]b}{[REDACTED]b} = [REDACTED]$.
