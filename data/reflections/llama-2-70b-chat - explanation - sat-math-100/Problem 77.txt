Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the comparison of the standard deviations. 
I mistakenly calculated the standard deviations for both lists and compared them, concluding that they were different. 
However, the correct comparison is between the standard deviations of the two lists, not the actual values.
