Explanation:
I made a mistake in my reasoning. I incorrectly assumed that the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 would be achieved when $t$ is as small as possible. However, the formula $a=1,052+1.08 t$ shows that as $t$ decreases, $a$ also decreases. Therefore, the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 will be achieved when $t$ is as large as possible.
