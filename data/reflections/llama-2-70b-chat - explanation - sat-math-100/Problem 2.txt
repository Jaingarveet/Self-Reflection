Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the expression and combined the like terms incorrectly.
The correct solution is:

$$\left(x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}\right)-\left(-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}\right)$$

$$= x^{2} y-3 y^{2}+5 x y^{2}-x^{2} y+3 x y^{2}-3 y^{2}$$

$$= 2 x^{2} y+2 x y^{2}-2 y^{2}$$

The expression is equivalent to choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
