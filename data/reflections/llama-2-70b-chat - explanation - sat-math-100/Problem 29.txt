Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a calculation error.
I correctly identified the formula for weight, $W=mg$, but I plugged in the wrong values for the mass of the object and the acceleration due to gravity.
I used the mass of the object as 150 kg, which is the weight of the object on Earth, instead of using the correct mass of the object, which is not given in the problem.
I also used the acceleration due to gravity for [REDACTED], which is 10.7 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$, instead of using the acceleration due to gravity for [REDACTED], which is 11.1 $\frac{m}{\sec ^{2}}$.
