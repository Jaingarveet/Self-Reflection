Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of sampling and its relation to the population.
I thought that option [REDACTED] was the best choice because it seemed to be the most straightforward method to gather information from a single store and generalize it to the entire population.
However, I realize now that this method is not appropriate because it only provides information about one store, and we cannot generalize the results to the entire population.
