Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the unit of measurement for the slope.
The slope of a line is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
In this case, the units of measurement for the slope are inches per year, since the height is measured in inches and the age is measured in years.
Therefore, the slope should be [REDACTED], not 7.8.
