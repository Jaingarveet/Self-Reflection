Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the equation that represents the total amount paid so far.
I thought the total amount paid so far was $30w$, but it should be $30w + 60$, since the initial payment of $60$ is included in the total amount paid.
Therefore, the correct equation to find the number of weekly payments required to complete the purchase is:
$300 = 30w + 60$
