Explanation:
I incorrectly diagnosed the patient with [REDACTED] based on the biopsy finding of granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and areas of necrosis. However, the correct diagnosis is [REDACTED], which is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi.
