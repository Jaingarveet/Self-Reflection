Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider all the possible factors that could cause an unstable lie in a multigravida at 34 weeks. I assumed that since the patient had two previous normal deliveries, uterine anomalies were the most likely cause. However, placenta previa can also cause an unstable lie, and it is a more common cause than uterine anomalies.
