Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all the choices listed were useful investigations for spondylolisthesis.
The gap in my knowledge was not recognizing that anteroposterior X-ray is not as useful as the other imaging modalities in diagnosing spondylolisthesis.
I did not carefully consider the question and the choices provided.
