Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the chemical properties of the bicarbonate buffer system rather than its concentration in the blood.
The gap in my knowledge was not in biochemistry but in understanding the specific requirements of the question.
I knew the correct properties of the bicarbonate buffer system but failed to consider its concentration in the blood.
