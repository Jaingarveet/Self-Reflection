Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not know the correct X-ray feature of pyloric stenosis.
The gap in my knowledge was in radiology, specifically in the interpretation of X-ray images.
I knew the definition of pyloric stenosis but was not familiar with its X-ray features.
