Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the specific characteristics of each type of ovarian tumor and how they relate to the risk of torsion during pregnancy.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the specific features of each type of ovarian tumor and how they affect the likelihood of torsion.
I made an assumption that theca lutein cysts were more likely to undergo torsion during pregnancy because they are associated with high levels of hCG, but this is not necessarily true.
