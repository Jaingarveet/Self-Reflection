  Explanation:
The correct answer is (E) In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.

The passage does not provide direct evidence to support options (A), (B), or (C). Option (D) is also incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the rate of cabin air replenishment in 1980 being sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup.

The passage only provides information about the change in the frequency of cabin air replenishment from once every 30 minutes before 1985 to once every hour since then. This information suggests that the lower the frequency of cabin air replenishment, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. Therefore, option (E) is the most strongly supported by the information above.
