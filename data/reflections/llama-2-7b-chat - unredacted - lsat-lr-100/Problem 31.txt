 Explanation:
The correct answer is (B) The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.

The passage states that the mayor's goal is to minimize overall environmental damage, but the new recycling projects would be counterproductive to this goal. The statement "The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken" explains why this is the case. If the city is investing a significant amount of resources in new recycling projects, it may not have the budget or resources to undertake other pollution-reducing projects that could be more effective in minimizing environmental damage.

The other options do not address the inconsistency in the mayor's claims:

* (A) The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials is irrelevant to the mayor's goal of minimizing overall environmental damage.
* (D) More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes is also irrelevant, as it does not address the issue of disposing of waste.
* (E) People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need is a psychological effect that does not directly address the mayor's goal of minimizing overall environmental damage.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.
