  Explanation:
The editorial argues that education is like the craft of painting, where the most important steps are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat. The argument suggests that just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting, a proper foundation is essential for successful learning.

The correct answer is (E) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience. This choice aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting.

The other choices do not logically complete the argument:

* (A) is unrelated to the argument, as it suggests that educators should be undemanding, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (C) is also unrelated, as it suggests that educators should revise their teaching methods, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (D) is partially related, but it does not complete the argument, as it suggests that teaching new students is more difficult than teaching advanced students, which is not a logical conclusion from the painting analogy.
* (E) is the most logically completing the argument, as it suggests that the success of a student's overall educational experience depends on their initial educational experience, which aligns with the idea that a proper foundation is essential for successful learning, just as a well-prepared surface is essential for a successful painting.
