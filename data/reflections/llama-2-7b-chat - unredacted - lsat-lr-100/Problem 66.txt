  Thank you for providing the context and question for the argument. Here's why option E is the exception to the lawyer's argument:

The lawyer argues that jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language to ensure that jurors have a basic but adequate understanding of their role. This is because the lawyer believes that greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions.

Option E, on the other hand, suggests that jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. This goes against the lawyer's argument that simplicity and clarity are important for ensuring that jurors understand their role and can apply it effectively.

While it is true that jurors do not need to know every detail of their role, a basic understanding of their responsibilities and the legal principles involved in the case is crucial for them to make informed decisions. Simplifying the instructions does not mean sacrificing accuracy or precision, but rather presenting the information in a way that is easy for jurors to understand.

Therefore, option E is the exception to the lawyer's argument, as it suggests that the details of the role of the jurors can be adequately described in simple language, which contradicts the lawyer's claim that simplicity and clarity are important for ensuring that jurors understand their role.
