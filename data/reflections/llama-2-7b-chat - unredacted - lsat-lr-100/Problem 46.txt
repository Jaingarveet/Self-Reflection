  Great job! You have correctly identified the key assumption that justifies the archaeologist's argument.

The correct answer is (C) The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.

The archaeologist's argument is based on the idea that the absence of the mosaics at the site will mislead future archaeologists who may not have access to the records of the previous archaeologists. The argument assumes that the materials used in the construction of the mosaics are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location, which is necessary for future archaeologists to draw accurate conclusions about the site. Without the mosaics, they may not be able to identify the materials used, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

Here are some key takeaways from this question:

* The archaeologist's argument is based on the assumption that the materials used in the construction of the mosaics are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location.
* This assumption is necessary for future archaeologists to draw accurate conclusions about the site.
* The absence of the mosaics at the site will mislead future archaeologists who may not have access to the records of the previous archaeologists.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
