  Explanation:
The correct answer is (E) The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. This information is crucial in establishing that the conclusion is properly drawn. If the groups received their instructions at different times, it could affect their ability to remember the specified time for the calls, which would make it difficult to draw a conclusion about the effect of aging on memory.

Here's why the other options are not helpful in establishing the conclusion:

A) There was the same number of people in each group: This information does not directly affect the conclusion, as the number of people in each group does not determine the accuracy of the memory recall.

B) The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups: This information does not affect the conclusion, as the researchers' role in answering the calls does not impact the accuracy of the memory recall.

C) Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old: This information is irrelevant to the conclusion, as the age of the college students does not determine their ability to remember the specified time for the calls.

D) Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls: This information is also irrelevant to the conclusion, as the availability of telephones does not impact the accuracy of the memory recall.

In conclusion, the only option that is helpful in establishing the conclusion is (E) The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. This information allows us to draw a conclusion about the effect of aging on memory based on the difference in lapse rates between the two groups.
