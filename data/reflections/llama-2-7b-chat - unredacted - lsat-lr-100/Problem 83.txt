  Excellent job! Your reasoning and explanation are spot on. Here's a breakdown of why each of the other options is incorrect:

A: No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet. - This option is not the assumption that supports the argument. While it is true that some celestial bodies cannot simultaneously be a moon and a planet, this is not the assumption that the argument relies on.

B: Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets. - This is the correct assumption that supports the argument. The argument states that Pluto is not a true planet because it formed in orbit around Neptune and was later ejected from that orbit. If Pluto had not been ejected, it would still be considered a moon orbiting Neptune, rather than a true planet.

C: If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon. - This option is also incorrect. The argument does not rely on the idea that Pluto would still be in orbit around Neptune if it had not been ejected. Instead, the argument focuses on the fact that Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was later ejected from that orbit.

D: The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet. - This option is incorrect because the argument does mention the size of Pluto, stating that it is larger than many asteroids. The argument does not rely on the idea that the size of a celestial body is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet.

E: For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively. - This option is the correct answer. The argument states that Pluto formed in orbit around Neptune and was later ejected from that orbit, which means it did not form in orbit around the sun exclusively. Therefore, the assumption that a celestial body must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively to be considered a true planet logically follows from the argument.
