  Great job on answering the question correctly! Your explanation for why you chose the correct answer is clear and concise.

To expand on your answer, the correct choice, option (C), Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, is the best explanation for the finding of the nicotine study. The study showed that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine.

The other options do not explain the finding of the nicotine study:

* Option (A) is incorrect because the study found that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers were identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoked. This suggests that the body is able to absorb and process the same amount of nicotine from cigarettes with different levels of nicotine.
* Option (B) is irrelevant to the study's findings. The study did not examine the number of cigarettes smoked per day, so it cannot be used to explain the finding that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
* Option (D) is incorrect because the study did not measure the level of tar in the cigarettes smoked by the participants.
* Option (E) is incorrect because the study did not examine the rate at which the level of nicotine in the blood decreases after smoking cigarettes is discontinued.

Overall, your answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and the ability to apply critical thinking skills to explain the findings of the nicotine study. Keep up the good work!
