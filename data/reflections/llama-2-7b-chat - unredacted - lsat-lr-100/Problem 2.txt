 Explanation:
The correct answer is (D): This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.

The given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that most of the Canadian films that won prizes at international film festivals were also shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. The statements only provide information about the relationship between the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and international film festivals, but they do not provide information about the relationship between the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival and Canadian films.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D), which states that not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.
