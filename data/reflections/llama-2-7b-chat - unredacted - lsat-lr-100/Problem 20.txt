  Great job! You have correctly identified the principle that justifies the judge's reasoning. Here's a breakdown of why each of the other options is incorrect:

A: Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other. This principle is not relevant to the scenario, as the defendant is charged with noncompliance with national codes, not local codes.

B: Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes. This principle is also not relevant, as the defendant is charged with noncompliance with national codes, not local codes.

C: Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. This principle is partially correct, as national codes often serve as a minimum standard for building codes, and local codes may go beyond these minimum standards. However, this principle does not apply in the scenario, as the defendant is charged with noncompliance with national codes, not local codes.

E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another. This principle is relevant, as the defendant's ignorance of the difference between national and local building codes could result in noncompliance with both laws. However, this principle does not directly address the judge's reasoning, as the judge is not relying on the defendant's ignorance of the law to justify the penalty.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance.
