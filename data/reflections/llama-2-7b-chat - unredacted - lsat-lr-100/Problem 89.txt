  Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative. The example presented in the passage demonstrates that people are capable of inventing and interpreting dream narratives, even when no actual dream has been related. The person who left the room and returned to ask yes-or-no questions about a dream they thought they had heard constructed a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group. This is in line with the proposition that interpreting another person's dream requires understanding the dream as a coherent narrative.

The other options do not accurately describe the scenario presented:

* (A) The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence. This does not explain why the person in the scenario was able to construct a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group.
* (B) One is less apt to reach a false understanding of what someone says than to make no sense out of it at all. This does not address the ability of people to invent and interpret dream narratives.
* (C) Dreams are often just collections of iruages and ideas without coherent structures. This is a general description of dreams, but does not explain why the person in the scenario was able to construct a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group.
* (E) People often invent clever and coherent stories to explain their behavior to other people. While this is true in general, it does not explain why the person in the scenario was able to construct a coherent narrative based on the answers they received from the remaining group.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative.
