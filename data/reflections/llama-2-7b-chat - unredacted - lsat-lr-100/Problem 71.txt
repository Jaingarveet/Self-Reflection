 Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.

Here's why:

The statement "Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection" is false, as the statement mentions that prints of works not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, are also sold in the museum store.

The statement "Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work" is also false, as the statement mentions that prints of works not part of the twentieth century, such as Hopper's Nighthawks, are sold in the museum store.

The statement "There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector" is true, as the information provided states that the museum store sells prints of works that are not part of the permanent collection, including Hopper's Nighthawks.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
