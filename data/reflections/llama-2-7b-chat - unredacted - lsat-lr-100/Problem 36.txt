  Explanation:
The argument depends on the assumption that those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds. This assumption is choice B: Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds.

The argument is based on the idea that native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words, but this perception is an illusion. The argument shows that this perception is an illusion by pointing out that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words.

The argument does not rely on the other options:

Option A is not a assumption, as it is not a necessary condition for the argument.

Option C is not a assumption, as it does not affect the argument's conclusion.

Option D is not a assumption, as it is not related to the argument's premise.

Option E is the correct assumption, as it is the basis for the argument.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
* Identify the assumption on which the argument depends.
* Choose the best answer based on the argument.
* Double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
