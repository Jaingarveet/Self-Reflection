  Explanation:
Patricia can make a strong counterargument to Tamara's objection by pointing out that the ninjas were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even if they did have squeaky floors in their houses. This counterargument is the strongest option, B: As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.

The other options do not provide a strong counterargument:

A: While it is true that some poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period may have had houses with intentionally squeaky floors, this does not undermine Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

B: The fact that the wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period does not directly address Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

C: While it is true that the fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated in the years following the Tokugawa period, this does not affect the fact that ninjas were trained to be stealthy and quiet, which would have made it difficult for the wealthy Japanese to detect them even if they did have squeaky floors in their houses.

D: The statement that the fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokugawa period does not directly address Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas.

E: The statement that there were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period does not directly address Tamara's claim that the wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors to detect ninjas.
