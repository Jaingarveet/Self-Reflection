  Explanation:
Morgenstern's argument is flawed because it relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true. Morgenstern assumes that Brooks will not find another job if he quits his current one, without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. This is a classic logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent," where the conclusion is assumed to be true without sufficient evidence.

The correct answer is (B) Morgenstern's argument is flawed because it relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true.
