Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the most effective treatment for comedonal acne. 
I knew that topical antibiotics were not effective and that estrogen could worsen acne. 
However, I mistakenly believed that benzoyl peroxide was the most effective treatment, when in fact, retinoids are the preferred treatment for comedonal acne.
