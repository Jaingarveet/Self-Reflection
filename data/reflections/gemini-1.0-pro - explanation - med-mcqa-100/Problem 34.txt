Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion associated with spring catarrh. 
I correctly identified that spring catarrh is an allergic re[REDACTED]tion to pollen. 
However, I failed to consider that pollen allergies can also trigger type IV hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tions.
