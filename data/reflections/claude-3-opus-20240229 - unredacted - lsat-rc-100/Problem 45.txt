Explanation:
I focused too heavily on the advantages of digital publishing mentioned in the passage, such as the ability to keep books perpetually "in print" and the economic efficiency. However, I overlooked the key point the author makes about what will drive the transition to the digital model.
The author argues that the demands of literary agents for higher author royalties will pressure traditional publishers to adapt to the digital model or lose authors to digital-only publishers. This is the primary impetus for the transition that the author identifies.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooking key information
 - Misidentifying main argument 
 - Focusing on supporting points instead of central claim
 - Inferring author's opinion incorrectly
Solution:
The passage states that under the digital publishing model, authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds since many traditional publishing expenses are eliminated. 
Literary agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional.
The passage then states that traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors to digital-only publishers.
This pressure from literary agents is described as the driving force that will push traditional publishers to adapt to the digital model.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree that the demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model (choice C).
