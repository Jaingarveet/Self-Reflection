Explanation:
Upon further reflection, I see that I misinterpreted the focus and scope of the two passages. Passage A is narrowly focused on the specific court case and the defendant's challenges to the fingerprint evidence used against him. In contrast, Passage B takes a broader view, discussing the general lack of objective standards and unknown error rates in fingerprint identification as a whole. Passage B does not focus on the specific court case mentioned in Passage A.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpreting passage scope 
- Confusing specific vs. general focus
- Overlooking broader implications
- Incorrectly comparing passage tones
Solution:
Passage A is narrowly focused on the specific court case at hand. It discusses the defendant's specific challenges to the fingerprint evidence used in his trial. The passage ultimately concludes that the trial court was within its discretion to accept the fingerprint evidence, despite acknowledging that further testing and standards may be desirable.
Passage B takes a more general, field-wide view of fingerprint identification. It discusses the overall lack of objective standards in the field for determining fingerprint matches. It highlights the unknown probability of different individuals sharing identifying characteristics. The passage also questions the error rates in fingerprint identification as a whole, citing the lack of systematic study and a rigorous test showing a 34% erroneous identification rate.
Compared to the narrower, case-specific focus of Passage A, Passage B is more general in its focus on the broader issues and implications surrounding fingerprint identification.
Instructions:
1. Read both passages carefully, identifying the main topic and scope of each.
2. Determine if each passage is discussing a specific case or the field in general.
3. Analyze how broad or narrow the implications of each passage are.
4. Compare the scope and focus of the two passages to each other.
5. Determine which passage has a more general, field-wide focus.
Advice:
- Always read passages closely to determine their specific focus and scope.
- Look for keywords indicating if a passage is discussing a specific case or a field in general.
- Consider the broader implications of each passage, not just the specific details.
- When comparing passages, analyze their scope relative to each other.
- Be careful not to confuse a passage's tone with its scope or focus.
