Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran must be the selected girls if He Zhilian is not selected. However, I then incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] could be selected since Guo Yanran was selected. I failed to consider that if [REDACTED] is selected, then both [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] cannot be selected due to the given conditions. This would leave only Ren Xiangyang and [REDACTED] as possible selections for the boys, which is not enough.
