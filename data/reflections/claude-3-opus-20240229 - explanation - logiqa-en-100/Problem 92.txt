Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified that only one professor could be fully correct, one half correct, and one fully incorrect. However, I incorrectly concluded that Professor Qian's statement was the only one consistent with this constraint. In fact, Professor Sun's statement is the only one that fits.
