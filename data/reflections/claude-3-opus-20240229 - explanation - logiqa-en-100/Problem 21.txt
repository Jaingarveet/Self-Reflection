Explanation:
Upon further reflection, I realize I misinterpreted the question and Xiao Wang's rebuttal. The question asks about the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen, not the content of the rebuttal itself.
Xiao Wang did not directly disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion or provide an alternative explanation. Rather, Xiao Wang pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument lacked persuasion and jumped to conclusions without sufficient evidence. Just because people don't normally observe distant comets flickering doesn't necessarily mean this instance is unusual - it could simply be due to lack of continuous, careful observation in the past.
