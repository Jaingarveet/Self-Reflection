Explanation:
I focused too narrowly on finding a direct reason why people who favor college student nannies wouldn't hire them. However, the correct answer provides an indirect explanation by revealing people's underlying motivations.
If people favor college students being nannies primarily because they think it's good for the students, not because they think the students will provide better service, that could explain why they wouldn't necessarily hire them personally.
My reasoning was too literal and I didn't consider the broader implications of the answer choices.
