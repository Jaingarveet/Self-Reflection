Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the best refutation, but the correct answer is [REDACTED]. I was drawn to [REDACTED] because it seemed to provide strong evidence against people living in the cave by making it inaccessible. However, I failed to consider that the collapse happened 5000 years ago, while the evidence of habitation (tools, pottery, etc.) dates back to the much older Neolithic period. So a later collapse doesn't actually refute people living there earlier.
In contrast, [REDACTED] directly contradicts the claim of the cave being a living space. If it was a cemetery and funeral venue, that suggests it was used for burial practices, not as a dwelling for hundreds of people. I overlooked the straightforward logical contradiction between living space and burial site.
