Explanation:
I failed to consider all possible arrangements of the islands given the constraints. I correctly identified that G must be the northernmost island and that F must be directly north of H. However, I did not account for the fact that I and E can be arranged in two different ways relative to each other, and these arrangements can occur on either side of the F-H pair.
