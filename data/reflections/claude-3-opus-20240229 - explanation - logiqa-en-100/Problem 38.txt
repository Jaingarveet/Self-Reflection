Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer [REDACTED], thinking that seawater pollution provided the best alternative explanation for the decline in crocodiles. However, upon further reflection, I realize that answer [REDACTED] actually provides the strongest reason why an increase in seals could lead to a decrease in crocodiles - competition for the same food source. I failed to properly consider how ecological relationships like competition could impact population dynamics.
