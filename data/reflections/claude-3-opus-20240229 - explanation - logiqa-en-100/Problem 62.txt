Explanation:
I incorrectly focused on finding a choice that directly contradicted the experts' opinion about livestock trampling causing the salamander population decline. However, the question asked which choice would raise the most doubts about the experts' opinion in general, not just the specific livestock trampling hypothesis.
While choice [REDACTED] does seem to contradict the livestock trampling hypothesis, choice [REDACTED] actually raises more fundamental doubts about the experts' overall opinion. Decreased rainfall and falling groundwater levels affecting the salamanders' water source environment could be an alternative explanation for the population decline that the experts did not consider. This gap in their analysis raises doubts about the completeness and validity of their opinion.
