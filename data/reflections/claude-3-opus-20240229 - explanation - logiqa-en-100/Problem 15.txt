Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. However, the first premise states that the microorganism "usually" breeds above freezing, not "always". This leaves open the possibility, even if unlikely, that the microorganism could still reproduce in freezing temperatures. The conclusion is highly likely to be true based on the premises, but there is a small chance it could be false.
