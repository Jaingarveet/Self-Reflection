Explanation:
I chose answer [REDACTED] because it seemed to best summarize the main idea of the paragraph - that a company needs to excel in at least one area to compete in the market. However, upon further reflection, I realize I misinterpreted some of the nuances and specifics in the original text.
The paragraph talks about what a company needs to do to "start" and gain an initial foothold, not necessarily what's required for long-term success and competition. It also uses more absolute language like "have to know" and "when others are doing as well", suggesting being the best in one area is a requirement, not just an advantage.
With this in mind, answer [REDACTED] is actually the closest match. It captures the necessity of being the best in one thing for a company to get started and succeed early on.
