Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option A as the best counterargument. While A could potentially argue against more wealthy Chinese transferring assets abroad, the information provided in A is not part of the given context. The question asks for the best argument based on the provided information.
Option B, which states that there are real estate speculators among wealthy Chinese in Beijing and Shanghai, is the best counterargument. It suggests that the increased investment in US real estate might be driven by speculation rather than a genuine transfer of assets abroad.
