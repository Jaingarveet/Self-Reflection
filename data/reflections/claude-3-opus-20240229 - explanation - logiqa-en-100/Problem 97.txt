Explanation:
I focused too much on trying to find an alternative explanation for the increase in posts, and didn't properly consider how the legal status of the forum could affect the argument. The legal status is actually quite relevant, as it suggests the forum is moderated and operating within the bounds of the law. This makes it less likely that the increased posts are indicative of a truly deteriorating social atmosphere, as a legal forum would likely not allow truly harmful content.
