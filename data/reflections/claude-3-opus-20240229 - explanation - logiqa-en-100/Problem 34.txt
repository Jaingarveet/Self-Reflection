Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the statement that was not a logical inference from Confucius' quote. Upon further reflection, I realize that option [REDACTED] "If you want, then give it to others" is actually the choice that does not logically follow. Confucius was advising against doing unwanted things to others, but option [REDACTED] incorrectly infers that you should give others what you want for yourself.
