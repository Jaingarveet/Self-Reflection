Explanation:
I incorrectly interpreted choice [REDACTED] as questioning the given opinion, when in fact it supports it. Choice [REDACTED] indicates that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia, which is consistent with the opinion that sand and dust storms are caused by grassland degradation due to climate drought. My error was in misinterpreting the implications of the choice with respect to the given opinion.
