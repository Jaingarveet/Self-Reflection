Explanation:
I made an error in my logical reasoning. I correctly identified the relative positions of the planning, finance, and administrative departments based on the given conditions. However, I failed to properly place the human resources, R&[REDACTED], and sales departments. I assumed the R&[REDACTED] department must be between human resources and sales to separate them, but this is not necessarily true based on the given information.
