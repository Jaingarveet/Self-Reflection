Explanation:
I incorrectly identified choice [REDACTED] as the answer that does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal to the argument for the external world's existence. However, upon further reflection, I realize that choice [REDACTED] is actually the one that does not pose a doubt or rebuttal. Choice [REDACTED] in fact supports the existence of the external world by pointing to the practical successes of science. My error was in misinterpreting the question and not carefully considering how each choice relates to the argument.
