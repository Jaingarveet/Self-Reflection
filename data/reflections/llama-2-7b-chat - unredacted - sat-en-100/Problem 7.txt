  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the key points that suggest the intended goal of the 1999 experiment was to determine the role played by CT fibers in the perception of pleasure:

1. The passage states that Olausson and his colleagues "decided that these fibers must be conveying a different dimension of sensory information than fast-conducting fibers." This suggests that the experimenters were interested in understanding the unique properties of CT fibers and their role in touch perception.
2. The experimenters wanted to know if the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. This suggests that they were interested in understanding the spatial resolution and sensitivity of CT fibers.
3. The passage states that Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers. This suggests that the experimenters were interested in understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the perception of pleasure.

Based on these points, it can reasonably be inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the role played by CT fibers in the perception of pleasure. Therefore, the best answer is option C.
