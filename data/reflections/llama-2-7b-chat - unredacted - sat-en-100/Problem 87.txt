  Great, you have correctly identified the implicit point about the resources that will be highly valued in space. The correct answer is (A) They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth.

In Passage 1, the focus is on the potential for space mining to provide earthly demands for precious metals and rare earth elements, which are valuable on Earth. However, in Passage 2, the author suggests that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth, implying that there may be new and unique resources that will be valuable in space.

Well done! Here are some more questions for you to practice:

1. Which point about the motivation for deep-space travel is explicit in Passage 1?
2. According to Passage 2, what are some of the consequences of space mining that merit careful consideration?
3. What is the plea that one speaker at the space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, concluded with?

Let me know when you are ready to submit your answers.
