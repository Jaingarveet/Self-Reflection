  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the key points that support choice D:

* The passage states that CT fibers are sensitive to gentle tactile stimulation, indicating that they are exposed to a stimulus.
* The insular cortex is activated when CT fibers are stimulated, suggesting that the emotional aspect of touch is processed in this brain region.
* The passage mentions that CT fibers specifically provide pleasurable sensations, further supporting the idea that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when these fibers are activated.

Based on these points, the correct answer is choice D: humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when conscious aspects of sensation are ignored. The passage provides evidence to support this answer, and the other options are not supported by the passage.
