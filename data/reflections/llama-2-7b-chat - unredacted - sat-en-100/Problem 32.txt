  Great, let's break down the problem and solution step by step:

Problem:

* You are given a table with information about the number of emerged seedlings in different soil samples, disturbed in either light or darkness.
* You are asked to select the soil sample in which the fewest number of seedlings emerged when disturbed in darkness.

Solution:

1. Read the table and identify the soil samples that were disturbed in darkness. These are Samples A, B, C, and D.
2. Count the number of seedlings that emerged in each of these samples. The results are:
	* Sample A: 0 seedlings
	* Sample B: 1 seedling
	* Sample C: 2 seedlings
	* Sample D: 3 seedlings
3. The fewest number of seedlings that emerged in a soil sample disturbed in darkness is 1, which is the number of seedlings that emerged in Sample B. Therefore, the answer is (B) Sample B.

Advice:

* Always read the problem carefully and identify the relevant information. In this case, the problem specifically asked for the soil sample in which the fewest number of seedlings emerged when disturbed in darkness.
* Use the information provided in the table to answer the question.
* Count the number of seedlings that emerged in each sample and compare them to find the sample with the fewest number of seedlings.
* Always double-check your answer to ensure that it is correct. In this case, you can verify your answer by re-reading the table and confirming that the fewest number of seedlings emerged in Sample B.
