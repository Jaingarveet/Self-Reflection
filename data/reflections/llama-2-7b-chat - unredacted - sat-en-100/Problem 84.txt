  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the key points related to the question:

* The passage mentions that farmers have long known that plowing can control weeds, but it also notes that plowing can lead to the emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
* The authors of the passage, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn Struik, conducted an experiment in the 1960s to investigate the relationship between soil disturbance, light exposure, and seed germination.
* They found that when they stirred up soil samples in the light, more weed seeds germinated than when they stirred up samples in the dark.
* The authors reasoned that when farmers plow their fields during the day, the buried weed seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight, which stimulates their germination.
* They concluded that exposure to light allows seeds to achieve maximum growth, which is the correct answer to the question.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) allow seeds to achieve maximum growth.
