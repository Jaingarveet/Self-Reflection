  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (A) the number of cortices activated in the brain during gentle brushing.

The passage states that while normal subjects had both the somatosensory and insular cortices activated, only the insular cortex was active when researchers brushed G.L.'s arm. This suggests that G.L. differed from the other test subjects in terms of the number of cortices activated in the brain during gentle brushing.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option (B) is incorrect because the passage does not provide any information about the physical dimensions of the somatosensory cortex.

Option (C) is incorrect because the passage does not provide any information about the intensity of nerve signals required to activate the insular cortex.

Option (D) is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the effect of MRI scanning on the basic function of brain cortices.

Great job!
