  Great, let's break down the answer:

The passage suggests that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution, were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth. This is evident in the passage when Mr. Lincoln states that the Constitution joined Free and Slave States together in a "house divided against itself," which he believes is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that the Constitution included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states. In fact, the passage highlights the tension between Free and Slave States and the challenges of maintaining a unified government with such a division.

Option B is also incorrect because the passage does not anticipate the Union's expansion into western territories. While the passage does mention the Union's growth and expansion, it does not suggest that this expansion was driven by the institution of slavery.

Option C is the correct answer because the passage suggests that the Constitution provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed. Mr. Lincoln argues that the government has stood thus divided for a long time, despite its growth and expansion, and that the institution of slavery has been a source of conflict and difficulty, rather than a unifying force. This implies that the Constitution provided a solid foundation for the government, but that the institution of slavery has proven to be a challenge to that foundation.

Therefore, the best answer is option C: The US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution, provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
