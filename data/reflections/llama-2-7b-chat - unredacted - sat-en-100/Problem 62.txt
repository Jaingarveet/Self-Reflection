  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (B) The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior.

Ken Dial observed that young birds, such as pheasants, quail, and tinamous, exhibited a unique behavior of jumping up like popcorn, flapping their half-formed wings, and taking short hops into the air. This observation led him to conclude that young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest. This central assumption is the basis for Ken's research on how baby game birds learned to fly, and it highlights the recent evolution of this behavior in young birds.

The other options are not accurate representations of Ken's central assumption:

Option (A) The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors is not directly related to Ken's research. While it is true that the acquisition of flight in young birds can provide insights into the evolution of flight in their ancestors, this is not the central focus of Ken's research.

Option (C) Young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest is not the main assumption of Ken's research. While it is true that young birds in a controlled setting may not require perches, this is not the primary assumption behind Ken's research.

Option (D) Ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel is not directly related to Ken's research. While it is true that ground-dwelling and tree-climbing predecessors to birds evolved in parallel, this is not the central focus of Ken's research.

In summary, the correct answer is (B) The tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior, which is the central assumption behind Ken Dial's research on how baby game birds learned to fly.
