  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the author's beliefs about running a household and raising children.

In Passage 1, the authors argue that women's primary role is in the home, and that their exclusion from political employments is necessary to maintain social harmony. They believe that women's duties as mothers and homemakers are essential to the common happiness of society, and that they are not suited for political roles.

The passage states, "The purpose of all these institutions must be the happiness of the greatest number. Everything that leads us farther from this purpose is in error; everything that brings us closer is truth." This suggests that the authors believe that the primary goal of society is the happiness of the greatest number, and that any institution or role that does not contribute to this goal is incorrect or untrue.

Furthermore, the passage argues that women's exclusion from political employments is necessary to maintain social harmony. The authors state, "If the exclusion from public employments decreed against women leads to a greater sum of mutual happiness for the two sexes, then this becomes a law that all Societies have been compelled to acknowledge and sanction." This suggests that the authors believe that the exclusion of women from political roles is necessary to maintain social harmony and promote the happiness of both sexes.

Based on these arguments, it can be inferred that the authors of Passage 1 believe that running a household and raising children yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men. They believe that women's duties as mothers and homemakers are essential to the common happiness of society, and that they are not suited for political roles. Therefore, the best answer is option B: "Yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men."
