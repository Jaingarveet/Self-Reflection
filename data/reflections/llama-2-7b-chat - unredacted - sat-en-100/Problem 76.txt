  Great, let's work through the passage together!

In Passage 1, Beveridge asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift to the American people. He argues that the United States has the capacity to feed and clothe the world, and that its coastlines enclose half the countries of Europe. This suggests that the United States has been blessed with abundant resources and geographical advantages, which make it a unique and exceptional nation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) divine gift to the American people.

Now, let's move on to Passage 2. In this passage, Beveridge discusses the issue of imperialism and the United States' role in the world. He argues that if the United States is to hold the Philippine Islands permanently, it must be prepared to defend its actions and expect protests from the Filipino people. He also notes that the United States has a responsibility to promote self-government in the Philippines and to avoid the mistakes of European empires.

What do you think Beveridge's main point is in Passage 2?
