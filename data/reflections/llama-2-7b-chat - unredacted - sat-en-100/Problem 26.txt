  Great, let's break down the question:

Which reaction does Akira most fear from Chie?

Akira is afraid that Chie will consider his proposal inappropriate.

Here's why:

Akira has come directly to Chie's house without going through the proper channels, which is a tradition in their culture. He has also proposed to Naomi without her knowledge or consent, which is unseemly and could be seen as disrespectful. Akira is afraid that Chie will reject his proposal outright or view him as immature and unworthy of Naomi's hand.

So, the correct answer is (A) She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
