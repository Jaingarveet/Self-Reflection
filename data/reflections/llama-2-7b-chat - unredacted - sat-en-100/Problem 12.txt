  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the key points that suggest the correct answer:

* The passage states that in the early 1990s, textbook authors acknowledged that humans had slow-conducting nerves (Option C).
* The passage then explains that these slow fibers only respond to two types of stimuli: pain and temperature (Option B).
* The passage goes on to say that experiments blocking fast fibers supported this notion (Option A).
* The passage then provides an example of a study conducted by Olausson and his colleagues, where they recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips (Option D).
* The passage explains that using a technique called microneurography, they were able to measure how quickly-or slowly-the nerves fired, and that the delay in the signal suggested that the nerve impulses were traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers (Option D).

Based on these points, the correct answer is Option D: The ability to perceive vibrations would be impaired. The passage suggests that blocking fast fibers only reduces sensitivity to warmth or a small painful shock, but does not eliminate the sensation of pressure altogether, which is consistent with Option D.
