  Great, let's break down the answer:

The correct answer is (A) Part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.

The passage suggests that the authors would agree that the changes in gender roles are part of a broader social shift towards greater equality. The authors argue that as society progresses towards greater equality, the distinctions between men and women's roles will become less pronounced. They believe that improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. This suggests that they recognize the benefits of gender equality and believe that it is a natural progression of society.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option (B) is unlikely to provide benefits that outweigh their costs. The passage does not suggest that the authors believe that the benefits of gender equality do not outweigh the costs. In fact, the authors argue that the changes in gender roles will raise woman and make her more and more the equal of man, which suggests that they believe the benefits of gender equality outweigh the costs.

Option (C) is inevitable given the economic advantages of gender equality. The passage does not suggest that the authors believe that gender equality is inevitable due to economic advantages. While the authors do acknowledge that the changes in gender roles will have economic advantages, they do not argue that these advantages are the primary driver of the changes.

Option (D) is at odds with the principles of American democracy. The passage does not suggest that the authors believe that the changes in gender roles are at odds with the principles of American democracy. In fact, the authors argue that the Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy, which governs the manufactures of our age, by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on. This suggests that they believe that the changes in gender roles are consistent with American democratic principles.
