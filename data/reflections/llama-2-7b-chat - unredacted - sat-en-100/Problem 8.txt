  Great, let's analyze the question and the choices:

Question: Based on data in the table, which of the four pathogens infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder?

Choices:

A: IAPV (83% for colonies with colony collapse disorder, 5% for colonies without)
B: KBV (90% for colonies with colony collapse disorder, 48% for colonies without)
C: Nosema apis (81% for colonies without colony collapse disorder)
D: Nosema ceranae (all four pathogens for 100% of colonies with colony collapse disorder, but no data for colonies without)

From the table, we can see that the highest percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder (81%) were infected by the fungus Nosema apis. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Nosema apis.

So, the answer is (D) Nosema ceranae.
