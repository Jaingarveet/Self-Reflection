  Great, let's break down the passage and identify the correct answer:

The passage identifies the factor that facilitated the baby Chukars' traction on steep ramps as:

C: The alternation of wing and foot movement.

The passage explains that the baby Chukars were using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb steep ramps. They angled their wings differently from birds in flight, aiming their flapping down and backward to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp. This suggests that the alternation of wing and foot movement helped the baby Chukars gain traction on steep ramps.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

A: The speed with which they climbed is not mentioned in the passage.

B: The position of their flapping wings is not relevant to the baby Chukars' ability to climb steep ramps.

D: Their continual hopping motions are not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) The alternation of wing and foot movement.
