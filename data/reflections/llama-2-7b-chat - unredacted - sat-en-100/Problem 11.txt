  Great, let's break down the problem and solution step by step:

Problem:

* The question asks for the percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder (CCD) that were infected by all four pathogens (IAPV, KBV, Nosema apis, and Nosema ceranae).
* The data in the table provides the percent of colonies with CCD that were infected by each of the four pathogens separately.
* We need to find the percent of colonies with CCD that were infected by all four pathogens together.

Solution:

* We can calculate the percent of colonies with CCD that were infected by all four pathogens by adding the percent of colonies infected by each of the four pathogens together.
* According to the table, 83 percent of colonies with CCD were infected by IAPV, 77 percent were infected by KBV, 90 percent were infected by Nosema apis, and 48 percent were infected by Nosema ceranae.
* Therefore, the percent of colonies with CCD that were infected by all four pathogens is: 83 + 77 + 90 + 48 = 358.
* So, the percent of colonies with CCD that were infected by all four pathogens is 358/100 = 35.8 percent.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 83 percent.

Advice:

* Always read the question carefully and understand the problem before starting to solve it.
* Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
* Double-check your calculations and assumptions to ensure accuracy.
* Use visual aids, such as tables or graphs, to help organize and interpret data.
* Consider multiple perspectives and sources of information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.
