  Great, let's analyze the narrator's reflection on the question:

The narrator indicates that the contrast between the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village and her family's ink shop is that the ink shop provides greater individual attention to customers. The narrator notes that Father had opened several of the boxes and was showing the customer the different inksticks, pointing out their unique qualities and explaining their significance. This suggests that the ink shop provides a more personalized experience for customers, with the owner taking the time to educate and consult with each customer.
