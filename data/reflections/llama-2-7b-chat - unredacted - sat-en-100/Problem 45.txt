  Great, let's work through this together! Based on the passage, the correct answer is (B) higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted. Here's why:

The passage states that when Seydel plowed one of the agricultural strips at midday, more than 80% of the surface of the field was covered with weeds, while only about 2% of the field was covered with weeds when he plowed it at night. This suggests that Hartmann's prediction of a lower percentage of weeds covered was incorrect.

So, the answer is (B) higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted. Great job!
