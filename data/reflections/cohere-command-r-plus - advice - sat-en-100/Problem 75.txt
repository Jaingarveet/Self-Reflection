Advice:
- Read the question carefully and identify the specific aspect being asked (inner thoughts, observations, setting, character traits). 
- Pay close attention to whose perspective is being presented in the text (narrator, specific character, or both). 
- Understand that shifts in focus can occur between different elements, such as setting and character traits, or between a character's inner thoughts and external observations. 
- Be mindful of the scope of the question; it may not encompass the entire passage but rather specific sections or shifts within it.
