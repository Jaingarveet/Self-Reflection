Advice:
 - Ensure a thorough understanding of the context and any associated data before answering. 
 - Focus on the specific claim being made and evaluate if the data directly address that claim. 
 - Avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions not explicitly supported by the data. 
 - Consider all aspects of the data and avoid selective interpretation. 
 - Be cautious when making inferences, especially when the data do not directly address the claim.
