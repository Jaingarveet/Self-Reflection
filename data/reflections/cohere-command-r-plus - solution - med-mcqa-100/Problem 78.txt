Solution:
The facial artery is a vital vessel that supplies blood to the structures of the face. While it does anastomose with other arteries, its termination is specifically through anastomosis with a branch of the ophthalmic artery. 

The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery and supplies blood to the eye and surrounding structures. It gives rise to several branches, including the dorsal nasal, lateral nasal, and frontal arteries, which provide collateral circulation to the face.
