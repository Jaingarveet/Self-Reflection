Solution:
Step 1: Identify the function primarily impacted by the nerve injury, which is swallowing and preventing aspiration.

Step 2: Recognize that the vagus nerve is indeed associated with swallowing and aspiration, but consider its branches and specific functions.

Step 3: The SLN, a branch of the vagus nerve, specifically controls the constriction of the vocal cords during swallowing, preventing food or liquid from entering the airway. This function is directly related to the patient's symptoms of recurrent aspirations.
