Solution:
Step 1: Identify the unique conditions during pregnancy that increase the risk of ovarian tumor torsion: 
- Increased blood supply to the uterus and ovaries, leading to enlarged ovarian veins.
- The growing uterus puts pressure on the ovaries, causing them to become more mobile. 

Step 2: Evaluate each tumor choice based on its characteristics during pregnancy: 
- [REDACTED]: Typically solid and less prone to torsion.
- [REDACTED]: Produce mucus, which can make them large, but this is not their primary risk factor during pregnancy.
- **[REDACTED]**: Can become quite large, and the firm consistency makes them more susceptible to torsion due to the increased blood supply and uterine mobility during pregnancy.
- [REDACTED]: Hormone-producing tumors that typically regress after pregnancy; not associated with increased risk factors during pregnancy.

Step 3: Choose the answer based on the unique context of pregnancy: 
Correct Answer: **C**. [REDACTED]s are most prone to undergo torsion during pregnancy due to their potential large size and firm consistency, coupled with the increased blood supply and uterine mobility during this unique physiological state.
