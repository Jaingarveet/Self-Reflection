Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose in the absence of oxygen. It occurs in certain conditions, such as during intense exercise when oxygen supply to muscles is limited. The end products of anaerobic glycolysis are indeed [REDACTED] molecules and 2 molecules of NADH. However, the correct answer choice in this context is "[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]" because NADH is the reduced form of NA[REDACTED], and it is formed by the addition of electrons and a hydrogen ion to NA[REDACTED].
