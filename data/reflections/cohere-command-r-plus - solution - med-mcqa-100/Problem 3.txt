Solution:
Step 1: Identify the properties requested in the question: elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid. 

Step 2: Evaluate each option: 
- [REDACTED]: elastic and sets by a chemical reaction, but typically catalyzed by tin or titanium. 
- [REDACTED]: not elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, but typically catalyzed by amine or phosphorous. 
- [REDACTED]: elastic and sets by an oxidation reaction, but typically catalyzed by lead or mercury. 
- Polyvinyl siloxane (PVs): elastic, sets by a chemical reaction, and can be catalyzed by chloroplatinic acid. 

The correct answer is **[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]**, as it meets all the criteria requested in the question.
