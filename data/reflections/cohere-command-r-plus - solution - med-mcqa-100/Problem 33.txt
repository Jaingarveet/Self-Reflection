Solution:
Cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting antigens at the dermal-epidermal junction.
In this disease, IgG autoantibodies primarily target collagen XVII, which is a transmembrane collagen component of the hemidesmosome, essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the skin.
Collagen XVII is bound by IgG on the epidermal side of the salt-split skin in this disease.
