Solution:
Bicarbonate buffers are crucial in maintaining the body's acid-base balance and stabilizing pH. While it is important that the pKa of the buffer is close to the physiological pH, the key reason why high concentration is ideal can be explained as follows: 

[REDACTED] high concentration of bicarbonate ions in the blood ensures a strong buffering capacity. This means that the buffer can effectively resist changes in pH, preventing drastic shifts that could be harmful to the body's sensitive biochemical processes. The body can maintain a stable internal environment, even when faced with external acids or bases.
