Solution:
Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic cysts or pseudocysts. While infection, obstruction, and fistula formation are potential complications, the major concern specific to this procedure is hemorrhage. The pancreas has a rich vascular supply, and there is a significant risk of bleeding during the operation or as a postoperative complication.
