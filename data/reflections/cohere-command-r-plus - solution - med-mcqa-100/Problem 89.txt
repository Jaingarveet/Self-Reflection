Solution:
Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward onto another.
Standard diagnostic imaging includes:
 - Anteroposterior (AP) X-rays to view vertebral alignment and any slip or displacement.
 - Lateral X-rays to assess spinal stability and identify potential nerve compression.
[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] scans provide detailed information and are often used for surgical planning but are not routinely required for initial diagnosis.
The AP X-ray is the primary tool for diagnosis and is therefore the correct answer.
