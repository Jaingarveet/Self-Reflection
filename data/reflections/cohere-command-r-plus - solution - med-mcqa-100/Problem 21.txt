Solution:
Senescent RBCs, or older red blood cells, are typically targeted by certain strains of *Plasmodium*, the parasite that causes malaria. *P. vivax*, *P. ovale*, and *P. falciparum* prefer young RBCs, while *P. malariae*, the parasite that causes quartan malaria, has an affinity for senescent RBCs. This is because *P. malariae* can persist in the body for extended periods, and as RBCs age, they become more susceptible to invasion.
