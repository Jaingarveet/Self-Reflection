Solution:
Aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] is essential for charging t-RN[REDACTED] molecules with the correct amino acids during protein translation. This process ensures that the specific sequence of amino acids is assembled into a polypeptide chain based on the mRN[REDACTED] template. 

[REDACTED], lysine, and methionine are all standard amino acids that undergo this process and are, therefore, dependent on aminoacyl t-RN[REDACTED] for their incorporation into proteins. 

However, hydroxylysine is unique. It is not a canonical amino acid but a derivative of lysine formed through a post-translational modification. [REDACTED] is not directly incorporated into proteins during translation; instead, it is a product of enzymatic modification of specific lysine residues within the polypeptide chain after protein synthesis.
