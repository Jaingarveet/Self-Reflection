Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is irrelevant to the archaeologist's argument. The archaeologist is concerned about the potential for future archaeologists to be misled by the absence of the mosaics, not about the potential for misleading interpretations of the site due to the removal of artifacts. The correct answer is [REDACTED] because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument that the decision to remove the mosaics should have been based solely on archaeological considerations. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Irrelevant answer choice
 - Lack of attention to detail
Solution:
The archaeologist argues that the mosaics should have been left in their original location to avoid misleading future archaeologists who may not have access to their records. To justify this reasoning, we need an assumption that supports the idea that removing artifacts from archaeological sites can lead to misleading conclusions. Answer choice [REDACTED] is the correct answer because it directly supports the archaeologist's argument that the decision to remove the mosaics should have been based solely on archaeological considerations. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the argument being made.
2. Identify the evidence and conclusion of the argument.

Advice:
 - Pay close attention to the argument being made and the evidence provided.
 - Evaluate each answer choice carefully and eliminate irrelevant or incorrect choices.
 - Look for answer choices that directly support the argument being made.
 - Be aware of answer choices that are irrelevant or that may be true but do not support the argument being made.
