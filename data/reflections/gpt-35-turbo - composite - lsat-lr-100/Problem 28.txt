Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option [REDACTED] as the answer, which weakens the argument. However, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer, which weakens the argument. 
Option [REDACTED] is not relevant to the argument, as it does not address the issue of whether violent crime is becoming a serious problem in the town. 
Option [REDACTED] weakens the argument by stating that more people are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities. This means that the increase in the number of calls involving violent crimes may not necessarily indicate an actual increase in violent crime, but rather an increase in reporting.
