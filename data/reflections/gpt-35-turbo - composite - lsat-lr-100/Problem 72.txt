Explanation:
I misinterpreted the role of the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton. 
The statement is not intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits, but rather to help show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Misunderstanding
 - Misreading
Solution:
The statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton is used to explain the importance of phytoplankton in the food chain. 
The argument explains how global warming affects the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton, which in turn affects the food chain. 
Since zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton, the decline in phytoplankton populations will eventually lead to declines in zooplankton populations and the rest of the food chain. 
Therefore, the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly.
