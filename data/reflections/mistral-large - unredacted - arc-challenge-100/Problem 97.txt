Solution:
The first step in the formation of sedimentary rocks is erosion.
Erosion is the process by which rocks and soil are broken down and transported by natural agents such as wind, water, and ice.
The eroded material is then deposited in a new location, where it can be compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rock.

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
2. Identify the topic of the question (in this case, sedimentary rock formation).
3. Recall the steps involved in the formation of sedimentary rocks.
4. Identify the first step in the process.
5. Choose the answer that matches the first step in the process.
6. State your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.

Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
 - Always follow the correct format for providing your answer.
