Solution:
The Ohio state tree is the buckeye.
Inherited traits are passed down from parents to offspring through genes.
The buckeye tree is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, large seeds, and smooth bark. These are all inherited traits that are passed down from parents to offspring through genes.
The change in leaf color during the autumn season is an inherited trait of the buckeye tree.

1. Identify the state tree.
2. Understand the concept of inherited traits.
3. Identify the inherited traits of the state tree.
4. Eliminate choices that are environmental factors.
5. Choose the answer that matches an inherited trait of the state tree.
