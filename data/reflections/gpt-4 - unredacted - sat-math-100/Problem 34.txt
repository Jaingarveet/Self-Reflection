Solution:
The sale price of the book is 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%). 
So, if $18.00 is 60% of the original price, we can find the original price by dividing $18.00 by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).
Calculate $18.00 / 0.60 = $30.00
Action: Answer("C")
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem and identify the given information.
2. Calculate the percentage of the original price that the sale price represents.
3. Divide the sale price by this percentage (in decimal form) to find the original price.
4. Write your answer in the correct format: 'Action: Answer("[ANSWER_CHOICE]")'.
