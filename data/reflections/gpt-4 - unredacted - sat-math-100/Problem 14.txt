Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the y-intercept. I incorrectly extrapolated the data to find the y-value when x = 0, which led me to the wrong y-intercept. The correct y-intercept should be the y-value when x = a, which is 0.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Extrapolation error
- Y-intercept error
Solution:
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, we can take the points (a, 0) and (3a, -a). The slope m = (-a - 0) / (3a - a) = -a / 2a = -1/2.
The y-intercept is the y-value when x = a, which is 0.
So, the equation of the line is y = -1/2x + 0. 
We can rearrange this to the form of the answer choices: 2x + y = 0.
However, we need to express the equation in terms of 'a', so we multiply the entire equation by 'a' to get: 2ax + ay = 0, which simplifies to x + 2y = 0, or in terms of 'a', x + 2y = a.
Instructions:
1. Identify the slope of the line by calculating the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points.
2. Identify the y-intercept as the y-value when x = a.
3. Write the equation of the line in the form y = mx + b.
4. Rearrange the equation to the form of the answer choices.
5. Express the equation in terms of 'a' by multiplying the entire equation by 'a'.
6. Choose the answer that matches your calculated equation.
