Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the flawed reasoning in the original argument. The flaw lies in the assumption that two overlapping groups (auto mechanics with extensive experience and mechanics who understand electronic circuits) represent the majority of all auto mechanics. I incorrectly identified the flaw as not accounting for other possible causes, which led me to choose the wrong answer.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Logical reasoning error
- Overlapping groups assumption
Solution:
The original argument assumes that because most auto mechanics have extensive experience and most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits, then most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for the possibility that some mechanics with extensive experience may not understand electronic circuits. 
The argument that most closely follows this flawed reasoning is choice E. It assumes that because most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer and most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers, then most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. This is a flawed assumption because it doesn't account for the possibility that some snow-removal companies that run lawn-care services may not hire additional workers.
Instructions:
1. Understand the flawed reasoning in the original argument.
2. Identify the assumption made in the original argument.
3. Compare the assumption in each choice with the assumption in the original argument.
4. Choose the answer that contains the same flawed reasoning as the original argument.
Advice:
- Always understand the reasoning in the original argument before comparing it with the choices.
- Identify the assumption made in the original argument.
- Compare the assumption in each choice with the assumption in the original argument.
- Choose the answer that contains the same flawed reasoning as the original argument.
- Don't rush, take your time to understand the logic behind each argument.
