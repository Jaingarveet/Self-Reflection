Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the curator's statement about the prints available in the museum store. I assumed that all prints sold in the store are of twentieth-century works, but the curator only mentioned that prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the store, not all works on display.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Assumption error
- Logical reasoning error
Solution:
The curator states that prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the store. This means that for every work displayed in the museum that is not on loan from a private collector (i.e., part of the museum's permanent collection), there is a print available in the store. Therefore, the correct answer is C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and all statements carefully.
2. Understand the relationship between the museum's permanent collection, works on loan, and prints sold in the store.
3. Identify the implications of these relationships.
4. Evaluate each answer choice based on these implications.
5. Choose the answer that must be true based on the curator's statements.

- Understand the logical implications of the given information.
- Evaluate each answer choice based on these implications, not on assumptions or external knowledge.
- Practice logical reasoning problems to improve your skills in this area.
