Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the behavior of the smokers (smoking more cigarettes) rather than the physiological limitations of nicotine absorption. The correct answer indicates that there is a limit to how much nicotine the blood can absorb in a day, which explains why the nicotine levels are the same regardless of the nicotine content in the cigarettes.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Focus on wrong aspect
- Overlooked physiological factor
Solution:
The study shows that the levels of nicotine in the blood of smokers are the same at the end of the day, regardless of the nicotine level in the cigarettes they smoke. This suggests that the amount of nicotine absorbed is not directly related to the nicotine content in the cigarettes. The best explanation for this would be that there is a physiological limit to how much nicotine the blood can absorb in a day, as indicated by option A. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
Instructions:
1. Understand the problem: The nicotine levels in the blood of smokers are the same at the end of the day, regardless of the nicotine content in the cigarettes.
2. Identify the question: What explains this finding?
3. Evaluate each option:
   - Does it explain why the nicotine levels are the same regardless of the nicotine content in the cigarettes?
   - Does it take into account the physiological aspects of nicotine absorption?
4. Choose the option that best explains the finding based on the information provided.
Advice:
- Always read the question and options carefully.
- Understand the problem before attempting to find a solution.
- Consider all aspects of the problem, including physiological factors.
- Don't focus on one aspect of the problem to the exclusion of others.
- Evaluate each option carefully before making a decision.
