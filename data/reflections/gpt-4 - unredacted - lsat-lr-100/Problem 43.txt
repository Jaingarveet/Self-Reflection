Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the part of the argument that discussed the control over feelings and promises, rather than the interpretation of promises. The correct assumption is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes no sense, which is the basis of the ethicist's argument.
Error Keywords:
- Interpretation error
- Logical reasoning error
- Assumption error
Solution:
The ethicist's argument is based on the interpretation of the promise in marital vows. The argument states that if "love" refers to a feeling, then the promise makes no sense because feelings are not within one's control. Therefore, the assumption that makes this argument logically sound is that promises should not be interpreted in a way that makes no sense. Hence, the correct answer is D.
Instructions:
1. Understand the argument made by the ethicist.
2. Identify the key points in the argument.
3. Understand what the question is asking - in this case, it's asking for the assumption that makes the argument logically sound.
4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the argument.
5. Choose the answer that best fits as the assumption that would make the argument logically sound.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what it's asking.
- Break down the argument into its key points.
- Understand the logical flow of the argument.
- Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the argument, not just in isolation.
- Be aware of the difference between an assumption and a conclusion in an argument.
