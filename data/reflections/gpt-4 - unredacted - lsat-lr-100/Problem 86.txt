Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I made an assumption that was not directly supported by the information provided. The passage does not explicitly state that people who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than those who flew prior to 1985. It only states that the conditions for the spread of airborne illnesses are more favorable now due to higher levels of carbon dioxide.
Error Keywords:
- Assumption error
- Inference error
- Reading comprehension error
Solution:
The passage states that the less frequently cabin air is replenished, the higher the level of carbon dioxide. Since the rate of air replenishment has decreased since 1985, it can be inferred that the level of carbon dioxide has increased compared to prior years. Therefore, the correct answer is E: In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
Instructions:
1. Read the question and passage carefully.
2. Identify the key information provided in the passage.
3. Avoid making assumptions that are not directly supported by the information in the passage.
4. Evaluate each answer choice in relation to the information provided in the passage.
5. Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage.
Advice:
- Always read the question and passage carefully to understand what is being asked.
- Avoid making assumptions that are not directly supported by the information provided.
