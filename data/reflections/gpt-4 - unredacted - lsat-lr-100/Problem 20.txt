Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the defendant's ignorance of the difference between the two codes, rather than the judge's reasoning that the defendant's excuse would have been acceptable if he had been charged with noncompliance with local codes. This implies that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Focus on wrong aspect
- Understanding of legal principles
Solution:
The judge's reasoning is based on the principle that any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. Therefore, if the defendant had been charged with noncompliance with local codes, his confusion about which codes applied might have been a valid excuse. However, since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable. The correct answer is C.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the judge's reasoning.
2. Identify the principle that the judge's reasoning is based on.
3. Match this principle with the options provided.
