Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the logical implications of the statements. I focused on the difficulty of growing cacti in humid climates and raising orange trees in cold climates, and concluded that most parts of the country cannot be humid. However, I overlooked the possibility that a part of the country could be both humid and cold, which would make it difficult to grow both cacti and orange trees.
Error Keywords:
- Logical error
- Misinterpretation
- Overlooking information
Solution:
The statements indicate that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees. This implies that most parts of the country are either not humid (to allow for cacti growth) or not cold (to allow for orange tree growth). However, if half of the country is both humid and cold (Choice A), it would be difficult to grow both cacti and orange trees, contradicting the initial statements. Therefore, Choice A must be false.
Instructions:
1. Understand the conditions for growing cacti and raising orange trees.
2. Understand the climate conditions in most parts of the country.
3. Evaluate each choice based on the given conditions and the climate of the country.
4. Identify any contradictions between the choices and the given conditions.
5. Choose the answer that contradicts the given conditions.
Advice:
- Always read the question and the choices carefully.
- Understand the logical implications of the given statements.
- Evaluate each choice based on the given conditions.
- Look for contradictions between the choices and the given conditions.
- Don't rush your decision; take your time to understand the question and the choices.
