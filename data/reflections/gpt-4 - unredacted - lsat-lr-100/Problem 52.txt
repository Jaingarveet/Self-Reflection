Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the flawed pattern of reasoning in the original argument. I focused on the assumption that there was only one cause for the problem (lack of birds or tire wear), while the actual flaw was in the logical sequence of the argument.
Error Keywords:
- Logical reasoning error
- Misinterpretation of argument
- Flawed pattern recognition
Solution:
The original argument follows this pattern: If A (squirrels eat from a bird feeder), then B (it will not attract many birds). However, A only happens if C (it lacks a protective cover). So, if C, then B. This pattern is most similar to choice B: If A (tire's pressure is too low), then B (the tire will wear out prematurely). But A will happen only if C (the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly). So, if C, then B.
Instructions:
1. Understand the pattern of reasoning in the original argument.
2. Identify the cause and effect relationship in the argument.
3. Identify the condition that leads to the cause.
4. Compare this pattern with the choices given.
5. Choose the answer that follows the same pattern of reasoning.
Advice:
- Always understand the logical structure of the argument.
- Identify the cause and effect relationship in the argument.
- Look for the condition that leads to the cause.
- Compare the pattern of reasoning in the argument with the choices given.
- Don't assume that the argument is based on a single cause-effect relationship. There may be a sequence of events or conditions leading to the final effect.
