Explanation: I focused too narrowly on the narrator's actions and failed to consider the broader context of the passage. I missed the key phrase "much less for the books than they are worth."

Error Keywords:
- Inattention to detail
- Overlooking context
- Misinterpretation

Solution: The narrator indicates that he pays Sempere much less for the books than they are worth. While he does leave a small amount of coins on the counter, it is not necessarily less than what Sempere expects, as Sempere may be aware of the narrator's financial situation and choose to accept a lower price.
