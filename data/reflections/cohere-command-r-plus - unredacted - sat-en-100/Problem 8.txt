Explanation: I misinterpreted the data in the table and selected the wrong pathogen. I knew to look for the pathogen with the highest percentage of infection, but I failed to consider the row representing "all four pathogens." 

Error Keywords:
- Data interpretation error
- Misinterpretation error
- Omission error

Solution: The table shows data for colonies with and without Colony Collapse Disorder, indicating the percentage of colonies affected by various pathogens. To find the correct answer, we need to focus on the data for colonies "without colony collapse disorder." For Nosema ceranae, the table states, "All four pathogens," indicating that 100% of the colonies without colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens, including Nosema ceranae. 

Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the specific data required to answer it.
2. Refer to the table and locate the data for colonies "without colony collapse disorder."
3. Examine each pathogen and its corresponding percentage of affected colonies.
4. Identify the pathogen with the highest percentage of affected colonies.
5. Pay close attention to any additional information provided in the table, such as the "all four pathogens" row.
6. Ensure that your interpretation considers all the provided data.

Advice:
- Always read the question and table prompts carefully to understand what data is being presented and what specific information is required to answer the question.
- Take your time to thoroughly examine the table and interpret the data accurately.
- Pay attention to all rows and columns, ensuring that you don't overlook any important information or special cases, such as the "all four pathogens" row in this case.
- Double-check your interpretation by considering all the provided data before selecting an answer.
