Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question. I interpreted the question as asking for a trait that is not influenced by genetics at all, rather than a trait that is not solely or primarily inherited. While all the traits listed can be influenced by both genetics and environment, intelligence is generally considered to be less heritable than the other traits listed.
