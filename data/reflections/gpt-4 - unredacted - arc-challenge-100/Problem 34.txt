Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the importance of independent verification in scientific research. While testing on human volunteers is a crucial step in drug development, it is not the most immediate way to strengthen the initial conclusions about the antibiotic's effectiveness. Independent verification through a separate lab can help eliminate bias and confirm the initial findings, thus strengthening the conclusions.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Independent verification
- Scientific method
Solution:
To strengthen their conclusions, the researchers should have their results independently verified. This can be done by asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic (C). Independent verification is a key aspect of the scientific method and can help eliminate bias, confirm initial findings, and strengthen conclusions.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and what is being asked.
2. Consider all the answer choices.
3. Remember the importance of independent verification in scientific research.
4. Choose the answer that involves independent verification to strengthen the conclusions.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand what is being asked.
- Consider all answer choices before making a decision.
- Remember the importance of independent verification in scientific research.
- Understand that while all steps in the scientific method are important, some steps may be more relevant to the question being asked.
