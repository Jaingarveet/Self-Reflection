Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of intersection.
I thought the intersection of two sets meant finding the number that both sets have in common, which is not always the case.
In this question, the intersection of hardcover books and fiction books means the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, which is not necessarily the same as the number of books that are common to both sets.
