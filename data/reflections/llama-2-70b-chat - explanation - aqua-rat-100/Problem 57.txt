Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade.
I correctly used the formula for the circumference of a circle and the formula for distance = circumference x time, but I made a mistake in my conversion of time from seconds to minutes.
I incorrectly converted 30 seconds to 0.5 minutes, when it should be 0.5 seconds.
This led to an incorrect calculation of the distance traveled.
