Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and solved for the wrong variable. I was trying to find the number of grams of health food that would provide 100% of the daily requirement of vitamin [REDACTED] and vitamin [REDACTED], instead of finding the number of grams that would provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.
