Explanation:
The price of the product is reduced by 30%, which means the new price is 70% of the original price.
To find the percentage increase needed to make it 100% again, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = (New price - Old price) / Old price

= ($100 - $70) / $70
= $30 / $70
= [REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
