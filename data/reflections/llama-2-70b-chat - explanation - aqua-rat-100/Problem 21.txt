Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the problem.
I thought the question was asking for the ratio of work done by x men to work done by y men, but it's actually asking for the ratio of work done by x men in x days to work done by y men in y days.
My mistake was not taking into account the time factor in the problem.
