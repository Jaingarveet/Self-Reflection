Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the distance traveled by Kevin.
I incorrectly calculated the distance traveled as 420 miles, when in fact it was [REDACTED] miles.
This mistake was due to a misapplication of the formula:

Distance = Time x Speed

I applied this formula incorrectly, using the speed of 70 mph for both the distance traveled to [REDACTED] and the distance traveled back to [REDACTED].
However, the correct speed for the distance traveled back to [REDACTED] should have been [REDACTED] mph.
