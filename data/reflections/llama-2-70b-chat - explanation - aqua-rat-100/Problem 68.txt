Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I made a mistake in my calculation.
I correctly identified the GCF and LCM of 350 and 7700, but I made a mistake in factoring 7700 to find the other integer.
I mistakenly factored 7700 as 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7, when in reality, it can also be factored as 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 x 7.
This mistake led me to choose [REDACTED] as the other integer, when in reality, it should have been [REDACTED].
