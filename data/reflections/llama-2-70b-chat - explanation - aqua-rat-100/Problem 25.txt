Explanation:
The correct answer is indeed [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, so the rate of change of the angle of elevation is 15°/10 minutes = 1.5° per minute.
2. The distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 45° is h/tan(45°) = h/1.
3. The distance from the car to the tower when the angle of elevation is 60° is h/tan(60°) = h/√3.
4. The height of the tower is h = d = h/tan(45°) = h/1.
5. The speed of the car is v = distance/time = h/10.
6. The time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower is t = distance/speed = h/10/v.
7. Substituting the values, we get: t = h/10/v = (h/10)/(h/10) = 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] = 5(1.732 + 1) = 5(2.732) = 13.66, which is indeed the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

The other choices were not correct because they did not take into account the rate of change of the angle of elevation, the height of the tower, or the speed of the car.
