Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and wrote the equation for the bus fare incorrectly. I also made a mistake in simplifying the equation.

The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

The train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is [REDACTED], not 94.

The correct equation is:

Bus fare = (4/3) * Train fare

The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6 * Bus fare = 6 * (4/3) * Train fare = 8 * Train fare.

The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8 * Train fare.

The total fare paid by both groups is Rs.1512, so we can set up the equation:

8 * Train fare + 8 * Train fare = 1512

Simplifying the equation, we get:

16 * Train fare = 1512

Dividing both sides by 16, we get:

Train fare = [REDACTED]

Therefore, the train fare for one person between Agra and Aligarh is Rs.[REDACTED].

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
