Explanation:
The given answer is incorrect because it is based on an incorrect calculation.
The calculation assumes that the number of students who took physics and math are integers, which is not necessarily true.
The correct approach is to use the fact that 20% and 28% are proportions of the total number of students, and not necessarily integers.
