Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I simplified the expression for x as follows:
x = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n + 2)2 / (n + 2)2
x = 2

However, this simplification is not correct. The correct simplification is:
x = (2n2 + 8n + 16) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n2 + 4n + 8) / (n2 + 4n + 4)
x = 2(n + 2) / (n + 2)
x = 2

Therefore, the range of x is indeed [REDACTED], which matches choice [REDACTED].
