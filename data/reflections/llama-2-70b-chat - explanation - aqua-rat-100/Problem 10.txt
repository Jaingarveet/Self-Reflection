Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the length of the space shuttle.
I incorrectly used the formula L = vht, where vh is the horizontal speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
Instead, I should have used the formula L = vt, where v is the total speed and t is the time it takes to pass a point.
The total speed of the space shuttle is the square root of the sum of the squares of its horizontal and vertical speeds: v = sqrt(140^2 + 17.5^2) = 195 m/s.
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is L = 195 m/s x 5 s = 9[REDACTED].
