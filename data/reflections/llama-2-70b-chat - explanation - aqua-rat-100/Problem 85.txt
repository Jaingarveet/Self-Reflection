Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the average speed of the elevator.
I incorrectly took the average of the two speeds, which gave me 1.5 steps/minute.
However, since the speed of the elevator is constant, the average speed should be the same as the speed in either case.
Therefore, the correct answer is 2 steps/minute, which is choice [REDACTED].
