Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation. I misunderstood the question and calculated the profit incorrectly.
The correct calculation is as follows:
1. The cost price of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200.
2. The seller, Karan, wants to make a 20% profit.
3. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 20% of the cost price and add it to the cost price.
4. 20% of the cost price is:
1200 x 0.20 = 240
5. The selling price should be:
1200 + 240 = 1440
6. However, the question states that Karan wants to offer a 20% discount, not make a 20% profit.
7. Therefore, the selling price should be:
1440 - (20% of 1440) = 1440 - 288 = 1152

So, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
