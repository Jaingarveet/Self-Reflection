Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

The reasoning for this answer is as follows:

1. The total width of all the pickets is x/2.
2. The total width with spaces is x/2 + 6.
3. The length of the fence is the total width times the number of pickets, which is x/2 + 6 \* 13 = [REDACTED] + 78.
4. To find the length of the fence in feet, we need to convert the result from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide the result by 12: [REDACTED] + 78 / 12 = [REDACTED].

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
