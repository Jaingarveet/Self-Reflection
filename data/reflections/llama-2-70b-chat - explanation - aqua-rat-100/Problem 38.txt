Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted.
I incorrectly calculated the number of faces as 6*5^2 - 1800, which equals [REDACTED].
However, the correct calculation is 6*5^2 - 300*6 = [REDACTED].
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which is option [REDACTED].
