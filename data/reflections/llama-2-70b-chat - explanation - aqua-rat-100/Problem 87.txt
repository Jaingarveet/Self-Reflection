Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the concept of permutation.
I thought that the number of ways to choose 2 oranges was equal to the number of ways to choose the first orange multiplied by the number of ways to choose the second orange.
However, this approach only works when the order of the oranges matters.
In this case, the order of the oranges does not matter, and we are counting the number of ways to choose 2 oranges without regard to order.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which is the number of ways to choose 2 oranges without regard to order.
