Explanation:
I made an error in my logical deduction. I incorrectly identified [REDACTED] as the handsome individual and [REDACTED] as tall. However, this is not the only possible arrangement that satisfies the given conditions. My mistake was in assuming that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] could not both be tall, which led me to incorrectly eliminate [REDACTED] as a potential candidate.
