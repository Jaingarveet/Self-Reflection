Explanation:
I failed to identify the correct choice that casts the most doubt on the assertion. 
I chose option [REDACTED], which does show a discrepancy between housing and land price increases, but it does not significantly weaken the assertion. 
The correct answer, option [REDACTED], presents a scenario where housing prices increased while land prices remained almost unchanged, directly contradicting the assertion that rising land prices are the primary driver of housing price increases.
