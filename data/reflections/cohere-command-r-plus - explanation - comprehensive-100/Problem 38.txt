Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and the choices provided. I focused on choice [REDACTED] as the inverse of the situation described, but I overlooked the fact that the question asks for the assumption that "enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn." I should have paid closer attention to the specifics of the professor's argument and the exact wording of the choices.
