Explanation:
I misinterpreted the condition that no breed should be featured on two consecutive days, mistakenly assuming it applied to individual breeds when, in fact, it referred to any combination of breeds. This led me to incorrectly eliminate choices that included pairings that could have appeared on consecutive days in different orders. 

Additionally, I overlooked the condition stating that any breed featured on day 1 should not be featured on day 7. This condition rules out choice [REDACTED], as it suggests a pairing that includes a breed from day 1 (Newfoundland) being featured on day 6, which could lead to a violation of this condition if the same pairing were featured on day 7.
