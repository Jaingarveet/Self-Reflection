Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not read the passages carefully enough to identify the main differences between them. Instead, I focused on the tone of the passages and incorrectly assumed that Passage B was more tentative in its claims. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Assumption
 - Focus on tone rather than content
Solution:
Passage B is more general in focus compared to Passage A. While Passage A presents fingerprint identification as a reliable form of evidence with an exceedingly low error rate, Passage B highlights the lack of consensus and objective standards in fingerprint identification, as well as the unknown likelihood of two individuals sharing identifying characteristics. It also mentions the lack of systematic study on the error rate for fingerprint identification. 
Instructions:
1. Read the passages carefully and identify the main differences between them.
2. Focus on the content of the passages rather than their tone.
3. Pay attention to the specific claims made in each passage.
4. Consider the evidence presented in each passage to support those claims.
5. Choose the answer that best describes the main difference between the passages.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and answer choices carefully.
 - Pay close attention to the content of the passages and the specific claims made.
 - Look for evidence presented in the passages to support those claims.
 - Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions.
 - Focus on the main differences between the passages rather than their tone.
