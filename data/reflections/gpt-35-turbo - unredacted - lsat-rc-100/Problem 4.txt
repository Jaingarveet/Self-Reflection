Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I did not pay close attention to the details in the passage. While the passage discusses Marshall's use of expert testimony, it does not suggest that he relied more on it in lower courts. The correct answer is B because the passage explicitly states that Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed. He declined to pursue some cases that were in keeping with the NAACP's goals but whose plaintiffs' likely impression on the public he deemed to be unfavorable.
