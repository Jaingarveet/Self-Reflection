Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice A, confident that it enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities to the court and to society. However, the author's attitude towards the twofold obligation is that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. The author believes that the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society ultimately benefits the defendant. The author argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false, and that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. The author believes that lawyers should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
