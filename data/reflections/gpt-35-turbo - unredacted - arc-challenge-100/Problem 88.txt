Explanation:
My initial answer was incorrect. The best course of action when the results do not match the hypothesis is to repeat the investigation. This is because the initial investigation may have had errors or other factors that affected the results. By repeating the investigation, Michelle can confirm whether the results are consistent and reliable. Once the investigation is repeated, Michelle can then analyze the data and revise the hypothesis if necessary. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of scientific method
 - Incorrect assumption about the next step
Solution:
When the results do not match the hypothesis, the next step is to repeat the investigation. This will help to confirm whether the initial results were accurate and reliable. Once the investigation is repeated, Michelle can then analyze the data and revise the hypothesis if necessary. 
Instructions:
1. Repeat the investigation to confirm the results.
2. Analyze the data to determine the cause of the discrepancy.
3. Revise the hypothesis if necessary based on the new data.
4. Repeat the investigation again if needed to confirm the revised hypothesis.
Advice:
 - Always follow the scientific method when conducting investigations.
 - Always repeat investigations to confirm the results.
 - Always analyze the data carefully to determine the cause of any discrepancies.
 - Always revise the hypothesis based on the new data if necessary.
 - Remember that science is an iterative process that involves testing and revising hypotheses.
