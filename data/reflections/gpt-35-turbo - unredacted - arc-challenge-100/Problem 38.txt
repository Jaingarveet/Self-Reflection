Explanation:
I incorrectly calculated the mass of each option. 
I made a calculation error in option D.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Unit error
Solution:
To find the lowest mass, we need to calculate the mass of each option.
Mass = Density x Volume
Option A: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 2 m^3 = 4000 kg
Option B: Mass = 2000 kg/m^3 x 4 m^3 = 8000 kg
Option C: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 6000 m^3 = 6000 kg
Option D: Mass = 1 kg/m^3 x 10000 m^3 = 10000 kg
The option with the lowest mass is option A, with a mass of 4000 kg.
Instructions:
1. Identify the density of each material.
2. Identify the volume of each option.
3. Calculate the mass of each option using the formula Mass = Density x Volume.
4. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
5. Choose the option with the lowest mass.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember to use the correct units in your calculations.
