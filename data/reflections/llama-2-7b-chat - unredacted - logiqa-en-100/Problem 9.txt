  Explanation:

The question asks which member of the two groups K can replace without violating any of the given conditions. To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem statement:

1. Each group has at least 3 employees.
2. F and K cannot be in the same group.
3. If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
4. M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
5. At least one of the same employees in both groups.

From condition 1, we know that the printing group has at least 3 employees, and the binding group has at least 3 employees.
From condition 2, we know that K cannot be in the same group as F.
From condition 3, we know that if K is in the printing group, then J must also be in the printing group.
From condition 4, we know that M is at least one of the members of the printing group or the binding group.
From condition 5, we know that at least one of the same employees (F, G, H, J, or L) is in both groups.

Now, let's analyze the options:

A) F: This option violates condition 2, as F and K cannot be in the same group.
B) G: This option violates condition 3, as G and J cannot be in the same group.
C) H: This option violates condition 4, as H is not one of the members of the printing group or the binding group.
D) L: This option violates condition 5, as L is not one of the members of both groups.

Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is:

Answer("B")

Correct Answer: B
