  Great, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If G is in team 1, then K must be in the middle (Condition 1).
2. If K is in the middle, then L must be in team 1 (Condition 6).
3. If L is in team 1, then neither P nor K can be in the same team as N (Condition 5).

Now, let's eliminate the impossible pairs:

B: K and P - K is already in the middle, so P cannot be in the same team as K.
C: L and N - L is already in team 1, so N cannot be in the same team as L.

So, the only possible pair is:

A: K and L - K is in the middle, and L is in team 1.

Action: Answer("D")

Correct! The answer is D: K and L can be in team 1 together.
