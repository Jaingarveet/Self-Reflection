 Explanation:
The problem is to allocate 7 employees to 3 departments (Public Relations, Production, and Sales) such that certain conditions are met. We need to find the possible combinations of employees and departments that satisfy the conditions.

The conditions are:

1. H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
3. If X is allocated in the Sales department, W must be allocated in the Production department.
4. F must be allocated in the Production department.

We can list the possible combinations of employees and departments:

1. Public Relations Department: W
2. Production Department: F, H, Y
3. Sales Department: G, I, X

Now, let's check each combination to see if it satisfies the conditions:

A. Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, X
This combination satisfies conditions (1) and (3). However, it violates condition (2) as F and G are in the same department.

B. Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: G, I, X; Sales Department: F, H, Y
This combination satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).

C. Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, Y, W
This combination satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).

D. Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, I, W; Sales Department: G, H, Y
This combination satisfies conditions (1), (2), and (3).

Therefore, the final distribution of the 7 employees is:

D. Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, I, W; Sales Department: G, H, Y
