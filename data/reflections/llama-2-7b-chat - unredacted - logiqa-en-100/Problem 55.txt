  My apologies for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected answer:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is D, as the arrangement given in option D meets all the conditions specified in the problem:

* H is in front, which satisfies condition 1.
* Middle is occupied by G, which satisfies condition 3.
* Q is in the middle of team 1, which satisfies condition 6.

Therefore, the arrangement in option D is the only acceptable arrangement for the second team's performance.
