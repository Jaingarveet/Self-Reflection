  Explanation:
The correct answer is (C) Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified.

The blogger's conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is based on the fact that 85% of the follow-up posts agree with their opinion. However, this does not necessarily mean that the remaining 15% of posts are unjustified or incorrect. It is possible that some of the objections to the post are more fully justified, and therefore, the conclusion that "Most people agree with me" is not entirely accurate.

The other options do not challenge the blogger's conclusion:

Option (A) suggests that some people may agree with the blogger's views but not with their analysis, but this does not necessarily mean that the blogger's conclusion is incorrect.

Option (B) is irrelevant, as it mentions the blogger's other articles being wrong, but this does not affect the conclusion drawn from the follow-up posts.

Option (D) is incorrect, as it suggests that the blogger's loyal fans are the ones making the follow-up posts, which is not the case.

Therefore, the best option to question the blogger's conclusion is (C) Some of the objections to the post are more fully justified.
