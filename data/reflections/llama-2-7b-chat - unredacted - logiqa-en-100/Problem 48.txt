  Great job! You have correctly identified the best argument against the initial statement. Here's why:

Option D provides a counterargument to the initial statement by highlighting the potential reasons behind the increased transaction volume, rather than simply attributing it to an increase in the number of wealthy Chinese individuals transferring their property abroad. This option acknowledges that the increase in transaction volume could be due to the perceived low risk of the US real estate market, which has been a popular destination for foreign investors seeking value preservation and appreciation.

Option A is incorrect because it suggests that the turnover has increased by 23%, but the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year. This is not a valid counterargument to the initial statement, as it does not address the reasons behind the increased transaction volume.

Option C is also incorrect because it suggests that there are groups of real estate speculators among the wealthy Chinese who have speculated in Beijing and Shanghai. While this may be a possible reason for the increased transaction volume, it is not the most relevant or logical argument against the initial statement.

Therefore, the best argument against the initial statement is option D: The risk of the US real estate market has been small in recent years and has a certain function of value preservation and appreciation.
