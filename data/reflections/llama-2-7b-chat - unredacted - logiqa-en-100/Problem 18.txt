  Great job! Your explanation and answer are correct. Here's a breakdown of why each of the other choices is not the correct answer:

A: The celebrity can't actually stop the gossip news from damaging her personal reputation.

This choice is not true because while the celebrity may not be able to completely stop the gossip news from spreading, they can certainly take steps to mitigate the damage to their reputation. By coming forward to clarify and refute the rumors, the celebrity can regain control of the narrative and prevent the gossip news from spreading further.

B: The reputation of a celebrity will not be affected by gossip news in the media.

This choice is not true because gossip news in the media can certainly affect a celebrity's reputation, especially if it is negative or sensationalized. The statement in the stem suggests that the celebrity is in an awkward situation due to gossip news in the media, and that their personal reputation may be damaged if they don't come forward to clarify and refute the rumors.

C: When faced with gossip news, the best strategy the celebrity can take is to clarify the truth.

This is the correct answer. By coming forward to clarify and refute the rumors, the celebrity can regain control of the narrative and prevent the gossip news from spreading further. This is the only option that can potentially mitigate the damage to their personal reputation.

D: Some friends of the celebrity came forward to praise her, which would have a counter-effect.

This choice is not true because while friends of the celebrity may come forward to praise them, this may not necessarily counteract the negative effects of the gossip news. In fact, it may even draw more attention to the issue and make it harder for the celebrity to regain control of the narrative.
