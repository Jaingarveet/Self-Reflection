  My apologies, thank you for pointing that out! Here is my revised answer:

Action: Answer("D")

The correct answer is D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential. This option weakens the argument by suggesting that while free speech is important, it may not be sufficient on its own to meet the needs of the people, and good social order is also necessary.
