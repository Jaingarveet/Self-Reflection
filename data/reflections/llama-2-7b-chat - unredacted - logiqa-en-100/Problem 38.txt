 Explanation:
The argument that the increase in seals caused the decline in crocodiles is weakened if there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles. This means that even if the number of seals has increased, it is not enough to explain the sharp decline in the number of crocodiles. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Explanation of the correct answer:
Option B states that despite the sharp decrease in the number of crocodiles and the increase in the number of seals, there are still fewer seals in the North Atlantic Ocean than crocodiles. This weakens the argument that the increase in seals caused the decline in crocodiles because it suggests that the number of seals is not sufficient to have a significant impact on the number of crocodiles.

Explanation of the other options:

Option A is not the correct answer because while seawater pollution could potentially harm crocodiles, it is not a direct cause of their decline.

Option C is not the correct answer because the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the number of crocodiles and the number of seals.

Option D is the correct answer because if crocodiles only eat capelin, and capelin is also the main food for seals, then the increase in seals would not directly affect the number of crocodiles. This means that the argument that the increase in seals caused the decline in crocodiles is weakened, as there is no direct link between the two.
