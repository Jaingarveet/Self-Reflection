  Great, you have correctly answered the question!

The correct answer is (B) pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion. Xiao Wang refuted Xiao Chen's views by pointing out the contradiction in his arguments. Xiao Chen claimed that the 1996D3 comet flicker light was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation, but people normally don't observe comets far away from the sun. This contradiction in arguments suggests that Xiao Chen's views are incorrect.

Well done! Here are some additional questions to help you reinforce your understanding of the topic:

1. What is the main point of contention between Xiao Chen and Xiao Wang?
