  Great job! You have correctly identified the correct answer, which is (D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects.

Here's why:

The information provided in the question stem only tells us that Xiao Qiang's study time is longer than Xiao Gang's, and Xiao Qiang has more books than Xiao Gang. It does not provide any information about the quality of Xiao Qiang's knowledge, Xiao Gang's intelligence, or the effectiveness of their treatment of life. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about the relative intelligence or knowledge of Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang based on the information provided.

So, the correct answer is (D) The information in the question stem is not enough to compare the difference between Xiao Qiang and Xiao Gang in other aspects. Good job!
