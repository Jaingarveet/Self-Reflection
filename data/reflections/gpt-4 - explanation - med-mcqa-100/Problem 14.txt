Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the end products of anaerobic glycolysis. While it's true that glycolysis produces [REDACTED] and 2 NADH, in anaerobic conditions, the NADH is used to reduce pyruvate to lactate, regenerating the NAD+ needed for glycolysis to continue. Therefore, the net end products are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
