Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I confused the Type 2 pattern of etched enamel with the Type 1 pattern. The Type 2 pattern is also known as the cobblestone pattern, not the honeycomb pattern. This was a factual error due to a misunderstanding or misremembering of the specific terminology associated with enamel etching patterns.
