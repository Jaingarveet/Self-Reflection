Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the specific type of malaria that primarily attacks senescent, or aging, red blood cells. While it's true that Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale preferentially infect reticulocytes, or young red blood cells, it's Plasmodium malariae, the causative agent of quartan malaria, that is known to infect older, senescent red blood cells.
