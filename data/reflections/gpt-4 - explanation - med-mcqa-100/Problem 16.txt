Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the anastomotic connections that would maintain blood supply to the upper limb in the event of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery. I incorrectly thought that the anastomosis between the posterior circumflex humeral artery and the circumflex scapular artery would be responsible for maintaining blood flow, when in fact, it is the anastomosis between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery that would do so.
