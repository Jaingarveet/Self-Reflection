Instructions:
1. Identify the coefficients of $x$, $y$, and the constant terms in each equation.
2. Choose one of the variables to eliminate by multiplying one or both equations by a constant.
[REDACTED]. Add or subtract the two equations to eliminate the chosen variable.
4. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for the remaining variable.
5. Check if the two equations represent the same line or two different lines.
[REDACTED]. If the two equations represent the same line, they have infinitely many solutions.
7. If the two equations represent two different lines, they have either one solution or no solution.
8. For the system to have no solution, the two equations must represent parallel lines.
9. Find the value of the constant $a$ such that the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ in the two equations are proportional but the constant terms are not.
10. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for $a$.
11. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
