Instructions:
1. Understand the Factor Theorem and how it applies to polynomial functions.
2. Identify the given values of $x$ and $f(x)$ in the table.
3. For each choice, substitute the given value of $x$ into the expression $x-a$.
4. Evaluate $f(a)$ using the given value of $a$.
5. If $f(a)=0$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
6. Choose the answer that makes $f(a)=0$.
7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
