Instructions:
1. Identify the method to solve the system of equations.
2. Multiply one equation by a constant to make the coefficients of one variable equal in both equations.
3. Multiply the other equation by a constant to make the coefficients of the same variable equal in both equations.
4. Add or subtract the two equations to eliminate one variable.
5. Solve for the remaining variable.
6. Substitute the value of the variable in one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.
7. Check the solution by substituting the values of the variables in both equations.
8. If the system has no solution, the equations will be inconsistent, and the coefficients of one variable will be proportional but not equal.
