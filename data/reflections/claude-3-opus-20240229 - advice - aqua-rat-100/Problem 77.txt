Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand exactly what it's asking for.
 - Don't add unnecessary constraints that are not mentioned in the question.
 - When dealing with consecutive numbers, it's often helpful to represent them using a variable and then manipulate the equation.
 - Keep in mind any constraints on the variable (like odd/even, positive/negative, etc.).
 - When you have multiple options, test each one to see which satisfies the conditions.
