Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully to identify the given information and the question being asked.
 - Be cautious about assuming independence of events unless it is explicitly stated or can be reasonably inferred.
 - Remember the basic probability rules and when to apply each one.
 - Consider the range of possible values for unknown probabilities and how they affect the calculation.
 - Probabilities must always be between 0 and 1, inclusive. If a calculation results in a value outside this range, it needs to be adjusted.
