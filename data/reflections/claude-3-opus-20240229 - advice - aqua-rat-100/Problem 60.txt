Advice:
 - Always read the problem statement carefully, noting any given relationships between points or arcs.
 - Visualize the problem by sketching the circle and labeling the given information. 
 - Remember that in a circle, the sum of a minor arc and its corresponding major arc is always 360Â°.
 - When calculating the measure of an arc between two points, consider the position of the points and whether you need to add or subtract the measures of known arcs.
 - If your calculated answer doesn't match any of the choices, re-check your assumptions and calculations.
 - Practice problems involving circles and arcs to improve your spatial reasoning skills.
