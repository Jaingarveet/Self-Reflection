Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully to understand what type of permutation is being asked for (with or without repetition).
 - Remember that for permutations without repetition, the formula is simply n!, where n is the number of distinct objects.
 - For permutations with repetition, you need to account for the repeated elements by dividing n! by the product of the factorials of the number of repetitions for each repeated element.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the problem and your calculations before selecting your answer.
