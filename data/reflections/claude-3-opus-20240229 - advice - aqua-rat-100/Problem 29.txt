Advice:
 - Always consider the boundary conditions or edge cases in problems involving sequences or iterations.
 - Be careful of "off-by-one" errors, especially when dealing with sequences starting from 0 or 1.
 - When a problem involves reaching a specific target value, consider whether you need an extra step after reaching the target.
 - Verify your solution by working through the problem with the calculated result to ensure it makes sense.
