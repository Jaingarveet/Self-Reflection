Advice:
 - Always consider whether order matters in a counting problem. If order doesn't matter, use combinations, not permutations.
 - Remember that with n items, you can create nC2 = n(n-1)/2 unique unordered pairs.
 - Break the problem down into cases and solve each case systematically.
 - Check your work by verifying that your solution yields the correct total number of unique codes.
