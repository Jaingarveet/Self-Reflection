Advice:
 - Always consider all explicit and implicit constraints in the problem.
 - Check your solution against all constraints to ensure it is valid.
 - If a problem seems unsolvable, consider the possibility that there may be no solution.
 - When dealing with percentages, remember that the sum of all percentages must equal 100%.
