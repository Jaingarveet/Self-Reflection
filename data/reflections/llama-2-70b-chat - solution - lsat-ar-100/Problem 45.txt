Solution:
Let's analyze the information given:

* Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
* None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
* Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
* Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

From the information above, we can deduce the following:

* Truvest's website target is 2 days (since it's shorter than its voicemail target).
* Truvest's voicemail target is 3 days (since it's longer than its website target).
* Image's voicemail target is 1 day (since it's the shortest voicemail target).
* Image's website target is 2 days (since it's longer than its voicemail target).
* Solide's website target is 1 day (since it's shorter than Truvest's website target).

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
