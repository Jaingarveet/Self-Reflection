Solution:
Start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row.
One of the restaurants must be in space 7, so place it there.
The other restaurant must be separated by at least two other businesses, so place it in space 3.
The optometrist must be next to the pharmacy, so place it in space 2.
The veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy or the optometrist, so place it in space 4.
The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so place it in space 6.
The shoe store is in space 4, so it is next to the veterinarian.
