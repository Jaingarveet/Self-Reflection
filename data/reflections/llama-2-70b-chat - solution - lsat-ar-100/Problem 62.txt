Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again, considering all possible scenarios:
If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then:
* Novetzke can be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia.
* Jaramillo can be assigned to either Venezuela or Zambia.
* Ong cannot be assigned to Yemen.
* Landon must be assigned to Zambia.
Given these assignments, the only possible assignment that satisfies all the constraints is:
* Kayne as ambassador to Yemen.
* Novetzke as ambassador to Venezuela.
* Jaramillo as ambassador to Zambia.
* [REDACTED]
