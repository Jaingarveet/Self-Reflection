Solution:
Let's analyze the given information:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they can be featured on any three consecutive days, as long as they are not featured on day 1 or day 7.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
