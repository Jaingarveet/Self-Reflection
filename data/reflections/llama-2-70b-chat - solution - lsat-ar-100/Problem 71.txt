Solution:
I should have carefully read and analyzed the conditions provided to determine the correct answer. Based on the conditions, we know that Parra and Tiao work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Given these conditions, the only possible combination of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr, which is option [REDACTED].
