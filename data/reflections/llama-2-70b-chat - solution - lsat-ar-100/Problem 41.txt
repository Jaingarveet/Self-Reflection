Solution:
Let's analyze the given information and the question again:

* Theresa tests G on the second day, so she cannot test H on the second day.
* Since Theresa must test H, she must test it on the first day.
* Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F or G on the first day.
* Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Yuki must test F on the first day.
* The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus must test F on the second day.
* Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G or J on the first day.
* Since Theresa tests G on the second day, Reynaldo must test J on the first day.

Now, let's look at the question again:
"If Theresa tests G on the second day, then which one of the following must be true?"

The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

Since Yuki cannot test J, Yuki must test H on the second day.
This answer choice is not dependent on the other given information, so it is the correct answer.
