Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions again:

* The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
* If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
* F and K cannot both be selected.
* K and M cannot both be selected.
* If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If both G and H are selected, then we have two botanists. According to the second condition, we can select at most one zoologist. Therefore, we must select either F or K.
