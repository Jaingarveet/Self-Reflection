Solution:
The correct order for the compositions to be performed is:

1. L
2. P
3. S
4. O
5. T
6. F
7. R
8. H

This order satisfies all the conditions stated in the problem:

* T is performed either immediately before F (in this case, immediately after R) or immediately after R.
* At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R (S and O), or after R and before F (T and L).
* O is performed either first (in this case, fourth) or fifth.
* The eighth composition performed is either L or H (in this case, H).
* P is performed at some time before S (in this case, second).
* At least one composition is performed either after O and before S (T), or after S and before O (R).
