Solution:
Let's re-evaluate the problem step-by-step:

1. Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
2. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
3. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
4. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.

Now, let's consider the given choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates constraint 2, as Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned together.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates constraint 1, as both [REDACTED] cannot be assigned to the same country.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This satisfies all constraints, as Kayne is assigned to Yemen, and Landon is assigned to Zambia.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates constraint 1, as both [REDACTED] cannot be assigned to the same country.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This violates constraint 4, as Landon must be assigned to Zambia.

We can see that choice [REDACTED] is the only one that satisfies all constraints:

* Landon is assigned to Zambia, satisfying constraint 4.
* Novetzke is assigned to Yemen, satisfying constraint 3.
* Kayne is not assigned to Yemen, satisfying constraint 1.
* Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, satisfying constraint 2.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
