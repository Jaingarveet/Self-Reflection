Solution:
I will re-evaluate the problem and consider all possible combinations of books that could be placed on the shelves.

1. G is placed on the top shelf.
2. I is placed on the middle shelf.
3. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
5. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
6. The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.

Possible combinations:

1. F, K, L, M, O on the bottom shelf.
2. F, L, M, O, K on the bottom shelf.
3. F, L, K, M, O on the bottom shelf.
4. F, M, L, K, O on the bottom shelf.
5. F, M, K, L, O on the bottom shelf.

In all possible combinations, the middle shelf can have either two or three books. The top shelf can have either G alone or G and F. The bottom shelf can have either F, L, M, O, and K or F, M, L, K, and O.
