Solution:
Theresa tests J on the first day, so Yuki must test H on the first day.
Seamus tests H on the second day, as the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day, as Theresa must test H, and Yuki must test J.
Seamus cannot test H on the first day, as Yuki tests H on the first day.
Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J, as Yuki tests J on the first day, and Seamus tests H on the second day.
Theresa cannot be one of the testers for G, as Theresa tests J on the first day.
