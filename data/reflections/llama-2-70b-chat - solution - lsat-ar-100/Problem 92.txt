Solution:
Either Parra or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 1.
Either [REDACTED] or [REDACTED] (but not both) works in Zone 2.
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
[REDACTED] and [REDACTED] work in the same sales zone as each other.
There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
Parra cannot work in Zone 1 if [REDACTED] works in Zone 1.
Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
[REDACTED] or [REDACTED] works in Zone 2.
Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
The only option that satisfies this condition is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
