Solution:
Let's break down the problem step-by-step again:

* The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so it's made on Tuesday.
* The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
* The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
* The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.

Now, let's consider the conditions:

* No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
* At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
* The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
* The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

From the given information, we can infer that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, not Wednesday.

Now, let's evaluate the choices again:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is true, as we have established that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is false, as we have established that only one batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
