Solution:
Let's revisit the question and diagram:

G - H - J
Q - R - S
Y

We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so we can start by placing the finance articles together:

G - H - J

We also know that S must be earlier than Y, so we can place Y in the last position:

G - H - J
Q - R - S
Y

Now, we need to determine where S can be placed. We know that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is [REDACTED]. Therefore, we can place Q in the [REDACTED] position:

G - H - J
Q
R - S
Y

However, this order violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, we must reverse the order of the finance articles:

H - G - J
Q
R - S
Y

Now, we can place S in the [REDACTED] position:

H - G - J
Q
R
S
Y

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
