Solution:
Let's analyze the conditions:

1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
2. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
3. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
4. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
5. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

From condition 1, we know that Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
From condition 2, we know that no breed can be featured on consecutive days, so we can't have the same breed of kitten and puppy on the same day.
From condition 3, we know that any breed featured on day 1 cannot be featured on day 7.
From condition 4, we know that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. This means that Himalayans can be featured on days 3, 5, and 7.
From condition 5, we know that Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. This means that Rottweilers can only be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's analyze the answer choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and Himalayans are featured on day 3, which violates condition 2. Therefore, this pair of days cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Rottweilers are featured on day 2, and Himalayans are featured on day 6, which violates condition 5. Therefore, this pair of days cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Himalayans are featured on both days 3 and 5, which violates condition 4. Therefore, this pair of days cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Newfoundlands are featured on day 4, and Rottweilers are featured on day 6, which violates condition 5. Therefore, this pair of days cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
Himalayans are featured on day 5, and Newfoundlands are featured on day 7, which violates condition 4. Therefore, this pair of days cannot feature both the same breed of kitten and the same breed of puppy.
