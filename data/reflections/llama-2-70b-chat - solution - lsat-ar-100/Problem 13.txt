Solution:
Given that Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, we can deduce that Hong must testify on Monday. Since Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco, Garcia must testify on Tuesday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, and exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Jackson must testify on Tuesday as well. Therefore, the only possible schedule that satisfies all the conditions is:

Monday: Hong, Franco
Tuesday: Garcia, Jackson
Wednesday: Iturbe
