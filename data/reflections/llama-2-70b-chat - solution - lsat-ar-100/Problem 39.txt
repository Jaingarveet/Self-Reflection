Solution:
Let's revisit the question and requirements:
The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, [REDACTED], and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements:
No more than four French works are selected.
At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

If three French novels are selected, we need to select at least [REDACTED] to meet the requirement that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
Therefore, option [REDACTED], which includes only [REDACTED], is not feasible.
Option [REDACTED] includes [REDACTED], which violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is not feasible.
Option [REDACTED] includes [REDACTED] and one Russian play. This option meets all the requirements, as we have selected at least three novels, no more than four French works, and at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is feasible.
Option [REDACTED] includes [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. This option violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is not feasible.
Option [REDACTED] includes two Russian novels and one French play. This option violates the rule that no more than four French works are selected. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is not feasible.
