Solution:
Re-reading the question, I realize that I should have paid closer attention to the conditions governing the selection of the panelists.
If M is the only chemist selected, the panel must include at least one botanist and one zoologist.
F must be selected since K and M cannot both be selected.
G and H can both be selected as botanists, and since M is selected, both P and R must be selected as zoologists.
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
