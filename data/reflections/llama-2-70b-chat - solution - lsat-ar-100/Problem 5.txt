Solution:
I should have carefully analyzed the conditions and considered all possible scenarios before drawing conclusions. Here's the correct solution:

1. F is on the same shelf as M.
2. I is on the middle shelf.
3. K is on a higher shelf than F.
4. O is on a higher shelf than L.

From the conditions, we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the top shelf must have at most two books.

We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf, and F must be on the middle shelf.

Since O is on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf.

Now, we can analyze the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is true. Since O is on the top shelf, and M is on the middle shelf, this condition must be true.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is true. We know that K is on the top shelf, and G is not on the top shelf, so this condition must be true.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is false. Since I is on the middle shelf, and F is on the middle shelf, this condition must be false.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is false. We know that G is not on the top shelf, and O is on the top shelf, so this condition must be false.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is false. Since F is on the middle shelf, and L is on the bottom shelf, this condition must be false.

Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
