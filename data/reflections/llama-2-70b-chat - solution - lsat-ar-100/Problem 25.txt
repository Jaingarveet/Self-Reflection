Solution:
Let's number the articles in the order they'll be edited: 1-7.

From the conditions, we know:

1. Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
2. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
3. S must be earlier than Y.
4. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

If G is fourth, we can create a possible order that satisfies all the conditions:

1. J
2. H
3. Q
4. G
5. R
6. S
7. Y

In this order, G is fourth, and H is fifth, so [REDACTED] is false.
J is first, so [REDACTED] is false.
Q is third, so [REDACTED] is false.
[REDACTED], so [REDACTED] is false.
Y is sixth, so [REDACTED] is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
