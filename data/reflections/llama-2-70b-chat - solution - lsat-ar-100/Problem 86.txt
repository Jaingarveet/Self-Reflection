Solution:
Given that bay 4 is holding produce, we can deduce the following:

* Bay 3 must be holding textiles since it is next to bay 4 and has a lower number.
* Bay 5 must be holding fuel since it has a lower number than bay 4 and cannot hold textiles or produce.
* Bay 6 must be holding machinery since it is the only type of cargo left and must be in one of the last [REDACTED] bays.

However, we cannot determine the type of cargo in bays 1 and 2 based on the information provided. There are multiple possible configurations for the types of cargo in bays 1 and 2 that are consistent with the information provided.
