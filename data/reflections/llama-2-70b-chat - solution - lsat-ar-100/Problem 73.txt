Solution:
Let's re-examine the given information:

* Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
* Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
* Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
* Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.

If exactly three students review Undulation, then we can list them as U1, U2, and U3. We can also deduce that U1 and U2 cannot be Megregian, as Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, U1 and U2 must be Kramer and O'Neill.

However, we still need to identify U3. We know that U3 cannot be Lopez, as Lopez does not review Undulation. Therefore, U3 must be Jiang, as Jiang reviews a different play than Kramer and O'Neill.

Thus, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
