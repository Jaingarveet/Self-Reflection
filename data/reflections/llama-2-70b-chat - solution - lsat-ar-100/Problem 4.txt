Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again, considering all possible scenarios:

1. If Lan leads a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] cannot lead a Wednesday session. In this case, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session, and [REDACTED] must lead a Friday session.
2. If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then [REDACTED] can lead a Wednesday session. In this case, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session, and [REDACTED] must lead a Friday session.
3. If Lan leads a Thursday session, then [REDACTED] cannot lead a Thursday session. In this case, [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday session, and [REDACTED] must lead a Friday session.
4. If Lan does not lead a Thursday session, then [REDACTED] can lead a Thursday session. In this case, [REDACTED] must lead a Wednesday session, and [REDACTED] must lead a Friday session.

From the above scenarios, we can see that in all cases, [REDACTED] must lead a Thursday session. Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
