Solution:
Re-read the question and identify the key conditions:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
4. Hong does not testify on Monday.
5. At least one witness testifies on Monday.

Now, let's consider all possible schedules that meet the conditions:

Schedule 1:

* Monday: Franco, Garcia
* Tuesday: Hong, Iturbe
* Wednesday: Jackson

This schedule violates condition 1, as Franco and Garcia testify on the same day.

Schedule 2:

* Monday: Franco, Hong
* Tuesday: Garcia, Iturbe
* Wednesday: Jackson

This schedule violates condition 4, as Hong testifies on Monday.

Schedule 3:

* Monday: Garcia, Hong
* Tuesday: Franco, Iturbe
* Wednesday: Jackson

This schedule violates condition 3, as only one witness (Franco) testifies on Tuesday.

Schedule 4:

* Monday: Garcia, Iturbe
* Tuesday: Franco, Hong
* Wednesday: Jackson

This schedule satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], as the schedule cannot have Jackson testifying on Tuesday and two witnesses testifying on Monday.
