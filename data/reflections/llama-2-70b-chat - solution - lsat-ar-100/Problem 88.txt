Solution:
We are given that:

* More books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf
* I is on the middle shelf
* K is on a higher shelf than F
* O is on a higher shelf than L
* F is on the same shelf as M

We can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K goes on the top shelf and F goes on the middle shelf.
We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so O goes on the top shelf and L goes on the bottom shelf.
We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so F and M go on the middle shelf together.

Now, let's place the remaining books:

* H goes on the bottom shelf with L.
* G goes on the top shelf with K.

Now, all the books are placed on the shelves:

Top shelf: K, G
Middle shelf: I, F, M
Bottom shelf: L, H, O
