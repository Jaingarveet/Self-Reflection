Solution:
We know that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, so we can infer that the three batches of cookies made on Monday, Thursday, and Friday will be different kinds of cookies.

We also know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, we can create the following possible schedules:

Schedule 1:

* Monday: Batch 1 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Tuesday: Batch 2 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of sugar cookies
* Thursday: Batch 2 of sugar cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Friday: Batch 3 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 3 of sugar cookies

Schedule 2:

* Monday: Batch 1 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of sugar cookies
* Tuesday: Batch 2 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Thursday: Batch 2 of sugar cookies, Batch 1 of peanut butter cookies
* Friday: Batch 3 of oatmeal cookies, Batch 3 of sugar cookies

In both schedules, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, and at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday and Thursday. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
