Solution:
Let's analyze the question again, taking into account all the given constraints:

1. Grain is in a higher numbered bay than livestock.
2. Livestock is in a higher numbered bay than textiles.
3. Produce is in a higher numbered bay than fuel.
4. Textiles are next to produce.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

* Bay 1: Fuel (since it's in a lower numbered bay than produce)
* Bay 2: Textiles (since it's next to produce and in a higher numbered bay than livestock)
* Bay 3: Grain (since it's in a higher numbered bay than livestock and not in conflict with any other cargo)
