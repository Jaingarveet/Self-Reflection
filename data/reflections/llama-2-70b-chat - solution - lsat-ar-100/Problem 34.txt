Solution:
Let's analyze the problem again, taking into account the correct conditions:

1. If F is selected as the botanist, then K cannot be selected as the chemist since K and M cannot both be selected. In this case, L must be selected as the chemist. This combination satisfies all conditions.
2. If G is selected as the botanist, then K can be selected as the chemist. This combination also satisfies all conditions.
3. If H is selected as the botanist, then L must be selected as the chemist. In this case, M must be selected as the third scientist, and P must be selected as the zoologist. This combination satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
