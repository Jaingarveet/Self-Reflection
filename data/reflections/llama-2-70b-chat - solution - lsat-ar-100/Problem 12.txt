Solution:
Let's analyze the rules again:

* J must be shown in the evening.
* K cannot be shown in the morning.
* L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

From the given information, we can deduce that the only pair of houses that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is J and K. This is because K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, they cannot be shown together, even if they were shown in reverse order.
