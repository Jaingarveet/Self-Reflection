Solution:
Let's re-evaluate the problem with a fresh perspective:

Given:

1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

If Young is assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, then we can infer that Young must be assigned either #5 or #6.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This violates rule 1, as Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This satisfies rule 1, but violates rule 3, as Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This satisfies rule 3, but violates rule 4, as Robertson cannot be assigned a parking space higher than #4.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This violates rule 2, as Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] This satisfies none of the given rules, as Vaughn is not mentioned in any of the rules.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]

Action: Answer("[REDACTED]")
