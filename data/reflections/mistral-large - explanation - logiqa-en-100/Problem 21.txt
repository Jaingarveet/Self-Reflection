Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the meaning of "refute" in the question. I thought it meant to disagree with the conclusion, but it actually means to prove something is wrong or false. Xiao Wang did not prove Xiao Chen's argument was wrong or false, but rather provided an alternative explanation for the observed phenomenon.
