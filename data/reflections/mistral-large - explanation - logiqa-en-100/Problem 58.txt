Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the percentage increase in housing prices compared to land prices, rather than the absolute increase in land prices.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in understanding the context of the problem.
I did not consider that a small percentage increase in land prices could still result in a significant absolute increase, which could be the chief culprit in soaring housing prices.
