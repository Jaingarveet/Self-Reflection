Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the argument and the question. I thought the argument was based on the increase in posts about certain social issues, and that the question was asking for a factor that could explain the increase in posts without necessarily indicating a deterioration in the social atmosphere. However, the argument was actually based on the comparison of posts about social issues published by netizens in the past year and 5 years ago, and the question was asking for a factor that would weaken the argument that the social atmosphere is rapidly deteriorating.
