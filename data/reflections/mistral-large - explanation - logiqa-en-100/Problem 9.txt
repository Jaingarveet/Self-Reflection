Explanation:
I made an error in my interpretation of the conditions.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the conditions and applying them correctly.
I misinterpreted condition (3) to mean that K and J must always be in the same group, but it only states that if K is in a group, then J must also be in that group.
I also overlooked condition (5) which states that at least one employee must be in both groups.
