Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the logical relationships between the statements.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the logical implications of the given statement.
I incorrectly assumed that if a company needs financing, it cannot pay dividends, and therefore, the only way for a company to finance is to issue new stocks.
However, the given statement does not imply that a company cannot have both financing needs and dividends.
It only states that a company with dividends does not need financing and that only companies with dividends can issue new stocks.
