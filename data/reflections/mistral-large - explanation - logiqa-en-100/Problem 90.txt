Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I focused on the trade-off between economic development and social stability, but I did not consider the overall impact of the situation on the country.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in understanding the broader implications of the statement.
I knew the correct relationship between the variables but failed to consider the overall impact on the country.
