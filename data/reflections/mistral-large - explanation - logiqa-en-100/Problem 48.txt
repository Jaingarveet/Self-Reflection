Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the argument and did not carefully consider the options.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the argument and identifying the best counterargument.
I misinterpreted the argument as being about the increase in transaction volume, rather than the increase in the number of Chinese buyers.
I also failed to consider that the argument was specifically about the transfer of property abroad, not just any real estate investment.
