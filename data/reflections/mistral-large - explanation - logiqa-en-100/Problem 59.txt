Explanation:
I made an error in my analysis of the conditions and the choices.
The gap in my knowledge was not in logic but in attention to detail.
I misread condition 3 as "If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department" when it should have been read as "If X is allocated in the sales department, W cannot be allocated in the production department."
I also misread condition 4 as "F must be allocated in the production department" when it should have been read as "F cannot be allocated in the production department."
