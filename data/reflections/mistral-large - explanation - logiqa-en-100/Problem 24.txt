Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the fallacy in the statistical reasoning.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the fallacy but in identifying the correct fallacy from the given options.
I knew that the sample size was small and biased, but I failed to recognize that the fallacy was a form of selection bias, not a problem with the sample size.
