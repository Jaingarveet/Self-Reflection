Solution:
An unstable lie can be due to several reasons, including placenta previa. [REDACTED]via is a condition where the placenta partially or completely covers the mother's cervix, which is the outlet for the uterus. This can cause the baby to change positions frequently, resulting in an unstable lie. Even though placenta previa often presents with other symptoms such as bleeding, it can still be the cause of an unstable lie even in the absence of these symptoms.
