Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose in the absence of oxygen, producing ATP and NAD+. The NADH produced in glycolysis is used to reduce pyruvate to lactate, regenerating the NAD+ needed for glycolysis to continue. Therefore, the net end products are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
