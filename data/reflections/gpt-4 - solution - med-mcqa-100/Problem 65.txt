Solution:
Post-radiation skin lesions like desquamation can sometimes heal on their own without active treatment. The correct approach depends on the severity of the lesion, the patient's overall health, and the presence of any complications. In this case, the correct answer is observation alone (B), which means monitoring the patient's condition but not providing any active treatment unless it becomes necessary.
