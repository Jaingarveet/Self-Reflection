Solution:
The Bishop score is calculated based on five parameters: dilation, effacement, station, cervical consistency, and cervical position. Each parameter is given a score from 0 to 3 (or 0 to 2 for station), and the scores are added together. 
In this case:
- Dilation: 3 cm (score of 2)
- Effacement: <0.5 cm (score of 3)
- Station: -1 (score of 1)
- Cervical consistency: slightly soft (score of 1)
- Cervical position: anterior (score of 1)
Adding these scores together gives a total Bishop score of [REDACTED].
