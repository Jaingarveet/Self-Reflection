Solution:
In the event of an obstruction in the second part of the axillary artery, the anastomosis that would maintain the blood supply to the upper limb is between the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery and the subscapular artery. This is because these arteries form an anastomotic network that can provide collateral circulation to the upper limb in case of obstruction.
