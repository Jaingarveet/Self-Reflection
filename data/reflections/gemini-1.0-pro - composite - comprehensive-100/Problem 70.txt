Explanation:
I made a mistake in setting up the equation that represents the equality of the populations in 2015. I incorrectly assumed that the population of City X in 2015 was 1.2 times the population of City Y in 2010, when it should have been 1.2 times the population of City X in 2010.
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect equation setup
- Population growth/decline calculation error
Solution:
Let $x$ be the population of City Y in 2010.
In 2010, the population of City X was 120,000.
From 2010 to 2015, the population of City X increased by 20%, so in 2015 it was 1.2 * 120,000 = 144,000.
From 2010 to 2015, the population of City Y decreased by 10%, so in 2015 it was 0.9 * $x$.
Since the populations were equal in 2015, we have 144,000 = 0.9 * $x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = 144,000 / 0.9 = 1[REDACTED]$.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and identify the key information.
