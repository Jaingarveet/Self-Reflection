Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are horror stories. 
However, the passage only states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
Therefore, not all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are horror stories. 
Error Keywords:
 - Overgeneralization
 - Assumption error
 - Logical fallacy
Solution:
The passage states that both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
Therefore, any story that describes a violation of a law of nature would also have to be intended to produce dread in the reader. 
However, the passage does not state that all stories that describe violations of the laws of nature are horror stories. 
Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
