Solution:
When the toy car moves from the inclined track to the flat surface, the forces influencing it change. On the incline, the force of gravity has two components: one parallel to the surface, contributing to the car's acceleration, and one perpendicular to the surface, which is counteracted by the normal force of the surface. When the car reaches the flat surface, the parallel component of gravity disappears, and only the perpendicular force remains, now balanced by the normal force from the flat surface. This change in forces results in a decrease in the car's speed.
