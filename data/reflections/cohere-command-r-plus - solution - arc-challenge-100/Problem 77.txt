Solution:
The question asks for the initial change in the sheep population following the introduction of a predator. The correct answer, [REDACTED], reflects the understanding that the presence of any predator will first result in a decline in the overall number of sheep, which are now vulnerable to predation. This decrease will affect the more abundant light-wool sheep population first, as they are now more accessible to the predator.
