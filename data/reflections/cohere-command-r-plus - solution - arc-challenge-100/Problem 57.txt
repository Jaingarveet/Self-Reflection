Solution:
The question asks for an inherited trait, which refers to characteristics passed down through genetics from one generation to the next. While the type of minerals absorbed from the soil can vary based on environmental factors, it is not inherently a genetic trait. 

The change in leaf color during autumn is a trait influenced by genetics. The genes of the buckeye tree determine the production and breakdown of pigments, resulting in the characteristic autumn colors. This trait is inheritable, as it is passed on to the next generation through genetic information.
