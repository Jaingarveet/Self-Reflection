Advice:
- Consider the broader context of the argument, not just isolated elements. 
- Understand the relationships between the argument's components and how they contribute to the conclusion. 
- Recognize that assumptions often address potential consequences or relationships between variables, filling in logical gaps in the argument. 
- Avoid focusing too narrowly on a single aspect of the argument; consider how the various elements interact to form the conclusion.
