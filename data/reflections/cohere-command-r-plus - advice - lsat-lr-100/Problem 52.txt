Advice:
- Be cautious when identifying fallacies and consider the specific structure of the argument, including necessary and sufficient conditions. 
- Look for clear relationships between premises and conclusions, indicated by phrases like "only if" or "if and only if." 
- Remember that Denying the Antecedent is a fallacy, but the correct answer may involve identifying necessary or sufficient conditions.
