Advice:
 - Carefully identify the argument's core assumptions and logic. 
 - Evaluate each answer choice based on how it challenges or supports these assumptions. 
 - Recognize that vulnerabilities often lie in unstated assumptions or logical gaps, so be critical and analytical in your interpretation. 
 - Avoid focusing on peripheral details that may distract from the central issue. 
 - Always ensure you fully understand the argument's structure and potential weaknesses before selecting an answer.
