Advice:
 - Carefully analyze the argument and identify its underlying assumptions and implications. 
 - Consider the role of each element in the argument and how they relate to one another. 
 - Look for answer choices that directly engage with these assumptions and their potential consequences. 
 - Avoid choices that introduce irrelevant or tangential concepts, even if they are related to the broader topic. 
 - Remember that the correct answer should reflect the logical foundation of the professor's conclusion, not necessarily its broader implications or potential benefits.
