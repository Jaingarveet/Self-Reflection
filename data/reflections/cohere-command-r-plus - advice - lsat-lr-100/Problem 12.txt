Advice:
- Be cautious of arguments that present a limited set of options, especially when they do not justify excluding other alternatives. 
- Recognize the fallacy of a false dichotomy, where two choices are presented as the only possibilities, ignoring other potential solutions or perspectives. 
- Consider the context and scope of the argument. Does it address all relevant factors and possibilities? 
- Evaluate the argument's structure critically and identify any assumptions or limitations that may affect its validity. 
- Remember that a strong argument should consider a comprehensive set of options and provide justifications for any exclusions.
