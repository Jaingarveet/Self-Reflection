Advice:
1. Ensure you fully understand the researcher's argument and the specific conclusion they are drawing. 
2. Identify the key factors and variables in the argument. 
3. Look for choices that introduce alternative explanations or common factors that could influence the results, rather than those that provide additional support for the argument. 
4. Consider how each choice might impact the validity or interpretation of the researcher's findings. 
5. Always read the question carefully and pay attention to the specific wording, such as "weaken the argument" or "support the argument."
