Advice:
 - Be cautious of arguments that assume causation based merely on correlation or co-occurrence.
 - Always consider alternative explanations for correlations, such as the possibility of a common cause.
 - Don't take for granted that because something is present when a condition occurs, it must be a cause of that condition.
 - Scrutinize the logical connection between an argument's premises and its conclusion.
 - Eliminate answer choices that identify flaws not present in the argument or that don't directly undermine the reasoning.
