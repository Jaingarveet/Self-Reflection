Advice:
 - Always look for gaps or invalid leaps in the logical reasoning.
 - Be careful not to get distracted by tangential assumptions and focus on the core logic.
 - Remember that people's motivations and the actual outcomes of their actions can often diverge.
 - Consider unintended consequences and side effects, not just intended results.
 - The correct answer will often pinpoint the central flaw that undermines the whole argument.
