Advice:
 - In legal reasoning questions, focus on the principles or rules that the decision-maker is relying on.
 - Pay attention to the implications of what is said, not just the explicit statements.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are too broad, too narrow, or unrelated to the specific reasoning used.
 - The correct answer will capture the key legal principle that makes the decision-maker's argument valid.
 - Don't get distracted by tangential details; focus on the core logic of the argument.
