Advice:
 - Always read the argument carefully and identify the premises and conclusion.
 - Look for the gap between the premises and the conclusion, and focus on finding the assumption that bridges this gap.
 - Be cautious of answer choices that are too specific or irrelevant to the argument's scope.
 - Consider the broader implications of each answer choice and how they relate to the argument as a whole.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure that the chosen answer, when combined with the premises, logically leads to the conclusion.
