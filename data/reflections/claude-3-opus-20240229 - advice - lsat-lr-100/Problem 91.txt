Advice:
 - Always read the passage closely, highlighting or noting the key facts and details.
 - Focus on what the passage directly states or implies, not just what it suggests or assumes.
 - Look for logical connections and inferences that can be drawn from the given information.
 - Be careful not to choose answers that are only partially supported or are based on information not in the passage.
 - Eliminate answers that are not supported, even if they could be true, and select the one with the strongest direct evidence.
