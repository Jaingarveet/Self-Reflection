Advice:
 - Always read arguments carefully and break them down into their component parts.
 - Identify both the explicit premises and the conclusion of the argument.
 - Look for unstated assumptions that are necessary for the conclusion to follow from the premises.
 - Be careful not to select an answer just because it is stated in the argument; it must be the key assumption.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or insufficient to make the conclusion follow logically.
