Advice:
 - Always break arguments down into their component logical steps.
 - Identify the specific nature of flawed reasoning, don't just note that it's flawed.
 - When comparing reasoning, focus on the logical structure, not just surface similarities.
 - Map out the logic of each argument fully before judging similarities.
 - Don't be distracted by arguments that are flawed in different ways than the original.
