Advice:
- Take your time to fully understand the argument before trying to identify the assumption.
- Focus on what the argument must assume to be true, not just what it explicitly states.
- Be careful not to bring in outside assumptions or interpret the argument too broadly.
- Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, extreme, or contrary to the argument's reasoning.
- Select the answer that is most integral to the logic of the argument as written.
