Advice:
 - Always keep the main point of the argument in mind; don't get sidetracked by minor details.
 - Consider the scope of the claim being made - does it apply to all or most of a group, or just to a specific subset?
 - Evaluate how each piece of information relates to and impacts the overall argument.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences that go beyond the given information.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant or fail to address the key issue raised in the objection.
