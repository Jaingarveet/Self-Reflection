Advice:
 - Focus on the logical structure of the argument.
 - Don't bring in outside knowledge or make unsupported assumptions.
 - The correct answer choice will be a critical piece of information required for the conclusion to follow from the premises.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are irrelevant, already stated, or go beyond the scope of the argument.
 - Consider how the argument would be impacted if each answer choice were false.
