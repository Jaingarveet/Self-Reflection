Advice:
 - In questions asking you to identify analogous reasoning, always start by clearly mapping out the structure of the original argument.
 - Break down each answer choice argument into its core components and reasoning structure.
 - Systematically compare each answer choice's structure to the original argument's structure.
 - Focus on the deep structure and logic of the arguments, not superficial similarities in topic or wording.
 - Always double check your chosen answer to ensure it truly is the closest match to the original argument's reasoning.
