Advice:
- In parallel reasoning questions, focus on the structure of the arguments, not just their superficial details.
- Break down arguments into their key components and relationships.
- Carefully consider all elements of the original argument and look for them in the answer choices.
- Eliminate answers that don't match the original reasoning pattern, even if they have other similarities.
- The correct answer will mirror the original argument's structure, not just its topic or wording.
