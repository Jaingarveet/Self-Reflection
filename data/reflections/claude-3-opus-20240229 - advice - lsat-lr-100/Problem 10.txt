Advice:
 - Don't get too fixated on the specific examples given in the question stem. Look for the broader principles.
 - The correct answer often expresses a general principle rather than just restating details from the question.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are too specific or that focus on tangential issues.
 - The correct answer should justify the reasoning, not just be consistent with the final decision.
 - If two answers seem to fit, choose the one that expresses the broadest relevant principle.
