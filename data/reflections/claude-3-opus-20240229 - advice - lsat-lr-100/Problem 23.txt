Advice:
 - Always read questions carefully and make sure you are addressing exactly what is being asked.
 - Break down arguments into their component parts and the logical relationships between those parts.
 - Map out the structure of an argument before attempting to identify the role of any one statement.
 - Be precise in your analysis - look for the answer choice that most fully and accurately captures the logical role of the statement in question.
 - Don't be distracted by other aspects of the argument that are not directly relevant to answering the question at hand.
