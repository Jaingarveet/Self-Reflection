Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the specific example given in the passage about regulating peer-group relationships and did not consider the broader context of proverb use in Mexican American communities.

Error Keywords:
- Overemphasis on specific example
- Lack of consideration of broader context

Solution:
The passage discusses the use of proverbs in Mexican American communities and their various functions, including the instruction of the young, regulation of peer-group relationships, and fostering a consciousness of ethnicity. It also mentions that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the most frequent use of proverbs is in regulating peer-group relationships. However, the passage does not suggest that this is the only or even the most important function of proverbs in Mexican American communities. Instead, it emphasizes that proverb use is shaped by the larger community and that the way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.

Instructions:
1. Read the passage carefully and identify the main topic.
2. Consider the various functions of proverbs discussed in the passage.
3. Identify any specific examples given in the passage, but do not overemphasize them.
4. Consider the broader context of proverb use in Mexican American communities.
5. Identify the answer choice that best reflects the main idea of the passage.

Advice:
- Always read the passage carefully and identify the main topic.
- Consider the broader context of the topic, not just specific examples.
- Identify the answer choice that best reflects the main idea of the passage, not just specific details.
- Be aware of any biases or assumptions that may influence your interpretation of the passage.
- Always double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately reflects the information in the passage.
