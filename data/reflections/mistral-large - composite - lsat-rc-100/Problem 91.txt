Explanation:
I misinterpreted the author's argument in passage [REDACTED] and failed to apply it correctly to the plan described in passage [REDACTED].
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the author's perspective on discretionary nonenforcement and how it applies to the situation in passage [REDACTED].
I incorrectly assumed that the author would prefer a more equitable solution, such as placing liens on properties, rather than selectively enforcing the rule against certain individuals.
However, the author's argument is that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusive rules, and the plan described in passage [REDACTED] is an example of this.
