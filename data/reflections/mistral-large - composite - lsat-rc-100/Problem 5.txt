Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not pay close enough attention to the specific details of the question and the answer choices. I misinterpreted the question as asking for the overall organization of the passage, rather than the specific organization of the material presented in the passage.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the question
* Lack of attention to detail
* Incorrect focus on overall organization rather than specific organization

Solution:
To solve the problem again, I would first carefully read the question and the answer choices to ensure that I understand what is being asked. I would then identify the three positions presented in the passage and analyze how they are organized. I would notice that the third position is differentiated from the second position in detail, rather than from the first position. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Carefully read the question and the answer choices to ensure understanding.
2. Identify the three positions presented in the passage.
3. Analyze how the positions are organized in relation to each other.
4. Focus on the specific organization of the material presented in the passage, rather than the overall organization of the passage.
5. Choose the answer that most accurately describes the specific organization of the material presented in the passage.

Advice:

* Always read the question and answer choices carefully to ensure understanding.
* Pay close attention to the specific details of the question and answer choices.
* Focus on the specific task at hand, rather than getting distracted by irrelevant information.
* Break down complex questions into smaller, more manageable parts.
* Use logical reasoning and analysis to arrive at the correct answer.
