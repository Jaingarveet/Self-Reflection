Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the author's praise of Toni Morrison's work and not enough on the specific aspect of her work that the author was discussing.

Error Keywords:

* Misinterpretation of the author's primary purpose
* Focusing too much on praise and not enough on the specific aspect of the work being discussed

Solution:
The author's primary purpose in the passage is to describe a particular aspect of one work by a particular writer, specifically how Toni Morrison uses jazz as a structuring principle in her novel Jazz. The author discusses how the narrative slips easily from third-person omniscience to first-person lyricism, and how this is analogous to the playing of a jazz band. The author also highlights how Morrison's use of language and narrative point of view serves to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.

Instructions:

1. Read the passage carefully and identify the author's primary purpose.
2. Focus on the specific aspect of the work being discussed, rather than the author's overall praise or criticism.
3. Identify any examples or evidence provided by the author to support their argument.
4. Choose the answer choice that best reflects the author's primary purpose.

Advice:

* Always read the passage carefully and identify the author's primary purpose before answering the question.
* Focus on the specific aspect of the work being discussed, rather than the author's overall praise or criticism.
* Identify any examples or evidence provided by the author to support their argument.
* Choose the answer choice that best reflects the author's primary purpose, rather than making assumptions based on your own interpretation.
* Always double-check your answer to ensure that it accurately reflects the author's primary purpose.
