Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the end products of anaerobic glycolysis. While it's true that glycolysis produces [REDACTED] and 2 NADH, in anaerobic conditions, the NADH is used to reduce pyruvate to lactate, regenerating the NAD+ needed for glycolysis to continue. Therefore, the net end products are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
Error Keywords:
- Misunderstanding
- Biochemistry error
- Anaerobic glycolysis
Solution:
Anaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose in the absence of oxygen, producing ATP and NAD+. The NADH produced in glycolysis is used to reduce pyruvate to lactate, regenerating the NAD+ needed for glycolysis to continue. Therefore, the net end products are [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
Instructions:
1. Understand the question and the process it refers to.
2. Recall the process of anaerobic glycolysis.
3. Remember that in anaerobic conditions, NADH is used to reduce pyruvate to lactate, regenerating NAD+.
4. Identify the net end products of anaerobic glycolysis as [REDACTED] and 2 NAD+.
5. Choose the answer that matches your understanding.
Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the process it refers to.
- Remember the specific details of biochemical pathways, including the conditions under which they occur and their end products.
- Don't rush your answer. Take your time to recall and understand the process.
- Always double-check your answer before finalizing it.
