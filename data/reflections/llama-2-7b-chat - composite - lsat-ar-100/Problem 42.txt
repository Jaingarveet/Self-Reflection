Explanation:
The problem states that a panel of five scientists will be formed from among three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists. The selection criteria are as follows:

1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
3. K and M cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

We are given five choices, and we need to determine which one is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel.

Let's analyze each choice:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates condition 1 because there are only two botanists (F and G) and no zoologists.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates condition 3 because K and M are both selected.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates condition 4 because R is selected but P is not.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates condition 1 because there are only two botanists (H and K) and no zoologists.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED] - This choice violates condition 2 because two botanists (H and L) are selected, and no zoologists are selected.

Therefore, the only acceptable selection of scientists for the panel is:
