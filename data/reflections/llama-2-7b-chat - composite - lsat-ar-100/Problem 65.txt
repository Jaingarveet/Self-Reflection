Explanation:
The conditions for selection are:

1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
2. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
3. F and K cannot both be selected.
4. K and M cannot both be selected.
5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

If M is the only chemist selected for the panel, then the conditions for selection are not satisfied.

1. There is no botanist selected, which violates condition 1.
2. There is only one chemist selected (M), but at most one zoologist can be selected, so there is no zoologist selected, which violates condition 2.
3. F and K cannot both be selected, but K is selected, which violates condition 3.
4. K and M cannot both be selected, but M is selected, which violates condition 4.
5. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected, but only one zoologist (R) is selected, which violates condition 5.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) [REDACTED]
