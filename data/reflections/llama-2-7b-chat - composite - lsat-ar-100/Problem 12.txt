Explanation:
The question is asking which pair of houses cannot be shown consecutively in either order. After analyzing the information given in the question, we can conclude that the only pair of houses that cannot be shown consecutively in either order is J and K.

Here's why:

1. K cannot be shown in the morning, and J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order.

The other options are incorrect because they cannot be shown consecutively in either order:

[REDACTED]: J and M cannot be shown consecutively in either order because M must be shown after L is shown, and L must be shown before M.

[REDACTED]: J and O cannot be shown consecutively in either order because O cannot be shown in the afternoon.

[REDACTED]: J and P cannot be shown consecutively in either order because P must be shown after J is shown, and J must be shown in the evening.

[REDACTED]: M and P can be shown consecutively in either order, so this is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order.
