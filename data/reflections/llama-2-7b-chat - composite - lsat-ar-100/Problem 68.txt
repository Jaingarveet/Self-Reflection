Error Keywords:

Solution:
Let's re-evaluate the conditions:
1. J is third, so G cannot be fourth.
2. If J is third, then G must be earlier than J.
3. S must be earlier than Q, so S cannot be fifth.
4. Y cannot be fifth because it covers wildlife, and the other articles cover finance (G) and nutrition (Q, R, S).

The correct answer is (E) [REDACTED].

Instructions:
1. Identify the position of each article based on the conditions given in the question.
