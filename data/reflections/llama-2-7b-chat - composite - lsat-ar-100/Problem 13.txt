Explanation:
The correct answer is (D) Hong testifies on Tuesday.

Here's why:

1. Franco does not testify on the same day as Garcia, so Franco cannot testify on Monday.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so at least one witness must testify on Monday.
3. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday.

The only possible schedule that meets all the conditions is:

Monday: Franco, Garcia, Hong
Tuesday: Iturbe, Jackson
Wednesday: None

Therefore, the answer is (D) Hong testifies on Tuesday.
