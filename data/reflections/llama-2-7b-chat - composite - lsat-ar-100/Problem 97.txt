Explanation:
You are correct in your analysis of the situation. Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on a different day.
2. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means it is made on Thursday.
3. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Now, let's evaluate each of the options:

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This cannot be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, which means that only one kind of cookie (peanut butter) has its first batch made on Monday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is the correct answer. Since the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then two different kinds of cookies (peanut butter and oatmeal) have their first batch made on Tuesday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This cannot be true because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is also not true because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

[REDACTED]: [REDACTED]
This is not possible because there are only three batches of cookies made each week, and the third batch is always the third batch of the same kind of cookie.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) [REDACTED]
