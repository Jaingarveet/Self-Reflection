Explanation:
You have correctly analyzed the problem and identified the possible selections based on the given requirements. Great job!

The correct answer is indeed option [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]. This selection meets all the requirements given in the problem, as you have mentioned:

1. No more than four French works are selected, so we can eliminate options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], as they have more than four French works.
2. At least three but no more than four novels are selected, so we can eliminate option [REDACTED], as it has only two novels.
3. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected, so we can eliminate option [REDACTED], as it has more Russian novels than French novels.
4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected, so we can eliminate option [REDACTED], as it selects the Russian play.

Well done! It's important to carefully analyze the problem and identify the possible selections based on the given requirements.
