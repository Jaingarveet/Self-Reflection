Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I incorrectly answered the question as "[REDACTED]" ([REDACTED]) when the correct answer is "[REDACTED]" (Injected into the portal vein).

The site of transplantation for islet cell transplantation in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is indeed the portal vein. Islet cells are typically transplanted into the portal vein, which is a major blood vessel that carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in the process:

1. Islet cell isolation: Islet cells are isolated from a donor pancreas using a specialized technique.
2. Islet cell purification: The isolated islet cells are then purified to remove any impurities.
3. Islet cell injection: The purified islet cells are then injected into the portal vein of the recipient.

The correct answer is therefore "[REDACTED]" (Injected into the portal vein).

I hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions!
