Explanation:
I apologize for my mistake in the previous response. I incorrectly selected answer "[REDACTED]" for the treatment of post-radiation skin lesions, such as desquamation. The correct answer is actually "[REDACTED]" - observation alone.

Post-radiation skin lesions, such as desquamation, can be treated with observation alone in most cases. Desquamation is a common side effect of radiation therapy and typically resolves on its own within a few weeks to months after treatment. In some cases, topical treatments such as petroleum jelly or antibiotic coverage may be recommended to help manage symptoms, but observation alone is usually the primary course of treatment.

I hope this clears up any confusion, and please let me know if you have any further questions.
