Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints and their implications: 
    - Pharmacy and veterinarian must be next to each other. 
    - Restaurants must be at opposite ends with at least two businesses between them. 
2. Identify the fixed positions: 
    - If the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 4. 
3. Determine the implications for restaurant placement: 
    - With the pharmacy in space 4, one restaurant must be at the opposite end (space 1 or 7) to ensure separation. 
4. Analyze the remaining options: 
    - Space 5: Veterinarian
    - Space 4: Pharmacy
    - Space 3, 2, or 1: Open for other businesses
    - Space 1 or 7: Restaurant
5. Conclude that a restaurant in space 4 fulfills all the constraints.
