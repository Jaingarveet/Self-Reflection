Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
2. Review the constraints and their implications:
    - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
    - Kevin and Rebecca must be on the same day.
    - Lan and Olivia cannot be on the same day.
    - Julio's session is earlier in the week than Olivia's.
3. Determine the sessions for the other lab assistants:
    - Nessa: Wednesday or Friday afternoon
    - Kevin and Rebecca: Thursday
    - Lan: Wednesday or Friday morning (Nessa afternoon, Kevin/Rebecca Thursday)
    - Olivia: Friday (Julio Thursday, earlier day constraint)
4. Count the number of lab assistants for whom we can determine the sessions.
