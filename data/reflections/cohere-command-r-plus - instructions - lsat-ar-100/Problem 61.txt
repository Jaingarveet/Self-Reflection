Instructions:
1. Understand the constraints:
    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both.
    - If Jaramillo, then Kayne.
    - If Ong to Venezuela, then not Kayne to Yemen.
    - If Landon, then to Zambia.
2. Identify the implications and possibilities:
    - Kayne and Novetzke cannot both be assigned.
    - If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
    - Ong and Kayne can be assigned, but not to Venezuela and Yemen, respectively.
    - Landon can be assigned, but only to Zambia.
3. Evaluate each choice for its truth potential:
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it satisfies Jaramillo-Kayne and leaves other assignments open.
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it satisfies the Kayne-Novetzke constraint and leaves other assignments open.
    - [REDACTED]: Not possible, as it violates Kayne-Novetzke and Landon-Zambia constraints.
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it leaves all assignments open except for Landon.
    - [REDACTED]: Possible, as it leaves all assignments open except for Ong.
4. Choose the answer that presents a situation that cannot be true.
