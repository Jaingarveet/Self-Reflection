Instructions:
1. Read and understand the conditions for setting the service targets carefully.
2. Identify the constraints and relationships between the clients' targets.
3. Start eliminating choices that violate the conditions:
   - Choice [REDACTED] can be eliminated as it violates the condition that website targets cannot be longer than voicemail targets.
4. Assign targets based on the remaining conditions:
   - Image must have the shortest voicemail target, so assign it a 1-day voicemail target.
   - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's, so assign Solide [REDACTED] and Truvest [REDACTED].
5. Review the choices and identify which target cannot be set for more than one client:
   - Choice [REDACTED] is the only option that violates the conditions for all clients.
