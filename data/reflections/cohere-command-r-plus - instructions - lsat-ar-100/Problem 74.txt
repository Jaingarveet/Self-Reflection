Instructions:
1. Read and understand the context and constraints carefully.
2. Identify the given constraints:
    - Landon, if assigned, must go to Zambia.
    - Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned.
    - If Jaramillo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned.
    - If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen.
3. Deduce the assignments based on the constraints:
    - Landon is assigned to Zambia.
    - Kayne and Jaramillo can be assigned, but not with Ong assigned to Venezuela.
    - Novetzke cannot be assigned due to the constraint.
4. Determine the pair of candidates who are not assigned:
    - Given the above, it is clear that [REDACTED] are the pair who are not assigned.
5. Choose the answer choice that reflects this deduction.
