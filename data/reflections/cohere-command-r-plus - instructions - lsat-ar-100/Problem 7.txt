Instructions:
1. Identify the given conditions: Jackson testifies on Monday, exactly two witnesses on Tuesday, Franco and Garcia don't testify together, Iturbe on Wednesday, and Hong not on Monday.
2. Start with the condition that has the least flexible options; Jackson testifies on Monday, and Hong cannot testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday. 
3. Build the schedule from there: Tuesday has two witnesses, so it could be Franco and Garcia, or Franco and Hong, or Garcia and Hong. 
4. Apply the remaining conditions: Franco and Garcia cannot testify together, so they must testify on Wednesday and Tuesday, respectively. 
5. Finalize the schedule: Monday - Jackson, Tuesday - Hong and Garcia, Wednesday - Iturbe and Franco.
