Instructions:
1. Read and understand the original constraint carefully, paying attention to the phrase "at least two other businesses."

3. For each choice:
   - Assess whether it guarantees the minimum separation of two spaces between the restaurants. 
   - Consider the placement and relationships between the businesses mentioned in the choice. 
4. Compare your interpretations with the original constraint to determine if they have the same effect. 
5. Choose the answer that mirrors the original constraint's requirement.
