Instructions:
1. Read the conditions carefully, especially those related to Nina, Helen, and Irving's reports. 
2. Interpret the conditions accurately: Nina's report influences the timing of Helen's and Irving's reports, but it does not require them to present on consecutive days. 
3. Assign George to Tuesday morning. 
4. Assign Olivia and Robert to morning sessions due to their inability to present in the afternoon. 
5. Assign Nina to Tuesday afternoon, allowing flexibility for Helen and Irving's reports. 
6. With Kyle and Lenore not presenting, match the remaining students to the available slots: Irving on Monday afternoon, Robert on Wednesday morning, and Helen on Wednesday afternoon.
