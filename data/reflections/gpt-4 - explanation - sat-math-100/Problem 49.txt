Explanation:
I made a mistake in the process of equating the numerators of both sides of the equation. I incorrectly combined the terms on the right side of the equation, which led to an incorrect quadratic equation. This error in the initial steps of the problem led to an incorrect conclusion about the value of 'a'.
