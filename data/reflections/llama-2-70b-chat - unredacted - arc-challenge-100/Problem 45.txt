  Explanation:
I made a mistake in my calculation of the weight of the astronaut on the Moon.
I correctly calculated the weight of the astronaut on the Moon as 31/6 = 5 pounds, but then I incorrectly converted it to kilograms.
I mistakenly thought that 5 pounds was equal to 14 kilograms, when in fact it is equal to approximately 2.3 kilograms.
Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Conversion error
- Unit confusion
Solution:
The weight of an object on the moon is about one-sixth of its weight on Earth, because the moon has only about one-sixth of the Earth's gravity.
So, the weight of the astronaut on the moon is about 31/6 = 5 pounds.
The mass of the astronaut is not affected by the location, so it remains at 84 kilograms.
The weight of the astronaut on Earth would be 5 x 6 = 30 pounds.
Instructions:
1. Calculate the weight of the astronaut on the Moon by dividing his weight on Earth by 6.
2. Convert the weight of the astronaut on the Moon from pounds to kilograms.
3. Recognize that the mass of the astronaut is not affected by the location and remains constant.
4. Calculate the weight of the astronaut on Earth by multiplying the weight on the Moon by 6.
5. Choose the answer that matches the calculated weight and mass of the astronaut.
Advice:
- Always double-check your calculations and unit conversions.
- Make sure you understand the difference between weight and mass.
- Pay attention to the given information and use it to your advantage.
- Don't make assumptions or confuse similar values.
- Practice solving similar problems to improve your problem-solving skills.
