  Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between weathering and deposition. I thought that weathering was the process that led to the construction of new land, but it is actually deposition that plays this role. Deposition is the process of sediment settling in a new location, which can lead to the formation of new land.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding
