I answered the question incorrectly because I overlooked the importance of independent verification in scientific research. While testing on human volunteers is a crucial step in drug development, it is not the most immediate way to strengthen the initial conclusions about the antibiotic's effectiveness. Independent verification through a separate lab can help eliminate bias and confirm the initial findings, thus strengthening the conclusions.
