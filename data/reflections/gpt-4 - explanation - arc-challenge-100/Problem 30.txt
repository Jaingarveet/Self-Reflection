Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the term "sublimation". I thought sublimation only referred to the process where a solid turns directly into a gas, without passing through the liquid phase. However, sublimation can also refer to the reverse process, where a gas turns directly into a solid, which is also known as deposition. In the context of the question, frost is formed when water vapor (a gas) turns directly into ice (a solid), which is a form of sublimation.
