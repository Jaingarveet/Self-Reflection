Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question. I interpreted the question as asking for a trait that is not influenced by genetics at all, rather than a trait that is not solely or primarily inherited. While all the traits listed can be influenced by both genetics and environment, [REDACTED] is generally considered to be less heritable than the other traits listed.
