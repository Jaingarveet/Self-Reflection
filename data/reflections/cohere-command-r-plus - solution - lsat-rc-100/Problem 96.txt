Solution:
Passage [REDACTED] discusses the admissibility of fingerprint evidence, with a focus on the longstanding use of fingerprint identification and the existence of established standards and practices. It mentions the "points and characteristics" approach and uniform standards through professional training and peer review. 

Passage [REDACTED] critiques the lack of consistent and objective standards among fingerprint examiners, emphasizing the varying practices and the absence of a consensus on what constitutes a match. It highlights the unknown error rates and the potential for mistaken identifications due to the subjective nature of fingerprint analysis. 

The central issue in both passages is the reliability of fingerprint identification practices, specifically the differences in identification practices and the lack of uniform standards. This is reflected in Choice [REDACTED], which mentions "[REDACTED]."
