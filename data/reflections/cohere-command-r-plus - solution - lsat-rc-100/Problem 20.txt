Solution:
The author presents a nuanced perspective on the obligations of defense lawyers. While the author acknowledges the lawyer's duty to both the defendant and the court/society, the key insight is that these obligations do not inherently conflict. 

The author's argument centers around the idea that defense lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false and should not deny a defendant's guilt if they are certain of it. Instead, they should focus on presenting the case in the best light, considering extenuating circumstances, and arguing for leniency if warranted. This approach respects the defendant's rights while also upholding the integrity of the court process. 

The correct answer, [REDACTED], conveys that the author is "convinced" that this two-fold obligation does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. It captures the essence of the author's argument, which is that defense lawyers can fulfill their duties to both the defendant and the court/society without these obligations interfering with each other.
