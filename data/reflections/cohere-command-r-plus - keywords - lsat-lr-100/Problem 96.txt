Solution: The provided context states that heavily congested highways have a low rate of fatal accidents. To explain this phenomenon, we must consider factors that reduce the severity of accidents, despite the heavy traffic. 

Instructions to solve the problem:
1. Focus on the key aspect of the question: why congested highways have a lower rate of fatal accidents.
2. Interpret "help explain the phenomenon" as seeking a factor that reduces accident severity.
3. Analyze each choice for its impact on accident severity, not congestion.
4. Choice [REDACTED] states that high speeds increase accident severity, which is a critical factor in fatal accidents.
5. Thus, [REDACTED] is the correct answer as it provides a direct explanation for the low rate of fatal accidents on congested highways.
