Solution: The argument presents a counterfactual situation: if the party's economic theories had been sound, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased, so the theories are deemed incorrect. This is similar to Choice [REDACTED], which argues that if the company had succeeded in a particular venture, its stock price would have doubled, but since the stock price didn't increase, the company must have failed. 

Both arguments commit the fallacy of denying the alternative. They assume that because the predicted outcome didn't occur, the opposite must be true, without considering other factors or explanations. Choice [REDACTED], my original selection, differs in that it uses architectural continuity to argue against the possibility of invasion, ignoring other potential reasons for the lack of change.
