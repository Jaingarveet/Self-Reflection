Solution: To weaken the researcher's argument, we need to find a factor that could influence the injury rates in both groups, regardless of their stretching habits. 

Choice [REDACTED]: This suggests that external factors reduced the overall injury rate, which could indeed weaken the argument. However, it does not explain why both groups had similar injury rates, as one might expect the group that stretched to have a lower injury rate if stretching was effective. 

Choice [REDACTED]: This choice introduces a potential difficulty for injured joggers in performing stretches, but it does not explain how this would impact the injury rates of those who do not stretch. 

Choice [REDACTED]: While most injuries may result from factors unrelated to flexibility, this does not explain why the group that stretches still had a similar injury rate to the non-stretching group. 

Choice [REDACTED]: This choice introduces a potential common factor that could influence both groups' injury rates. If prone to injuries, joggers may be more likely to stretch, which could result in both groups having similar injury rates, regardless of the effectiveness of stretching. 

Choice [REDACTED]: While stretching may reduce injury severity for certain exercises, this does not address the specific comparison made by the researchers between joggers who stretch and those who do not.
