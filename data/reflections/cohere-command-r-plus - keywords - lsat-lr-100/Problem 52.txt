Solution: The original argument states: "If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. Squirrels eat from a bird feeder if it lacks a protective cover." This argument presents a conditional statement with a flawed inference. 

Choice [REDACTED] presents a similar argument structure: 
"If a tire's pressure is too low, it will wear out prematurely. [REDACTED] tire's pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly." 

Here, the argument correctly identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions. The correct answer, Choice [REDACTED], uses the phrase "only if," indicating a necessary condition, and presents a clear relationship between the premises and the conclusion.
