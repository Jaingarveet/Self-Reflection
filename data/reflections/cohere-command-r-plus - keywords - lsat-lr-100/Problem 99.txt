Solution: The professor's argument revolves around the tension between freedom of thought and intellectual discipline. While freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue ideas without restraint, the professor introduces the notion that intellectual discipline is necessary to fully explore the implications of interrelated ideas and make true intellectual progress. 

Choice 'C' states: "[REDACTED]" This choice directly contradicts the professor's argument, as it suggests that in societies that uphold freedom of thought, thinkers are unable to exercise the necessary intellectual discipline to make meaningful progress. The professor's argument implies that this lack of discipline, resulting from unrestrained freedom, hinders the very progress it aims to facilitate.
