Solution: The science journalist's statements are about the classification of celestial objects based on their mass and the presence or absence of lithium in their atmospheres. 

Brown dwarfs are defined by having more mass than planets but less mass than stars, and they lack fully functional nuclear furnaces, which means their lithium is not consumed. 

Choice [REDACTED] states, "[REDACTED]" This is supported by the journalist's explanation that brown dwarfs are distinguished by their mass range and the presence of lithium, as their nuclear furnaces are not active enough to consume it. If an object has no lithium, it cannot be a brown dwarf because brown dwarfs are the only category of objects expected to retain lithium.
