Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the author's argument. The author's argument is not that increased size always leads to monopoly power, but rather that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power. Choice [REDACTED] undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power by suggesting that there are diminishing returns to specialization, which would limit the ability of larger businesses to achieve increasing returns to scale.
