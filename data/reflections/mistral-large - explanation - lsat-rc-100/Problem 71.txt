Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the author's criticism of the argument made in passage [REDACTED]. I thought that the author was criticizing the assumption that all human behavior can be explained by the proliferation of genes, but the author was actually criticizing the assumption that it is sufficient to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.
