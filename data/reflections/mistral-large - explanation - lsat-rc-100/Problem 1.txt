Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the objection raised by the proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph. I thought they objected to the use of Western scientific methods to investigate nonscientific cultures, but they actually objected to the use of one society's literary theories to criticize the literature of a society that has different values.
