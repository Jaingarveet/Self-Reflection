Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misunderstood the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. I thought the criticism was that the second version was not essentially different from the first because it still used Western scientific methods, which are value-laden and may distort the understanding of non-Western cultures. However, the criticism is actually that the second version is not essentially different from the first because it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
