Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on Dostoyevsky's definition of "artistic" and not enough on the radical critics' view of "useful" literature.
The gap in my knowledge was not understanding the context of the radical critics' view of literature.
I knew Dostoyevsky's views on literature, but I did not fully comprehend the radical critics' perspective.
