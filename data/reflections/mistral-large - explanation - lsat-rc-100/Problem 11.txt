Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and the author's assertion. The author's assertion is that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is the first to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel, not that it is the first novel to use music as a theme or metaphor.
The gap in my knowledge was in understanding the author's assertion and the question.
I did not carefully read and analyze the question and the author's assertion.
I made an assumption about the author's assertion without fully understanding it.
