I incorrectly answered the question because I focused too much on the disagreement between the proponents of the two proposals and their critics, rather than identifying the main point of the passage. The main point of the passage is that both proposals for promoting multicultural understanding are flawed because they are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system.
