Solution:
The passage states that "Akira came directly, breaking all tradition" in his approach to Chie. It then questions if Chie would have been "more receptive" if Akira had "followed form" by going through his parents and a "go-between" to arrange the proposal. This establishes that Akira's direct approach violated social norms and expectations.
Later, Akira explicitly acknowledges the "unseemliness of this proposal" and explains he came directly only because going through intermediaries "takes much time." This shows Akira recognizes his proposal is inappropriate, but felt he had no choice given his time constraints. 
Chie's amusement at Akira's earnestness is mentioned, but it is a minor detail compared to the major emphasis placed on the inappropriate nature of his surprise visit and proposal. Akira's concerns about being seen as childish are never directly stated, while his fear of his proposal being deemed unseemly is made explicit.
