Solution:
The passage makes the following key points about the Constitution's provisions for slavery:
1. The Constitution has allowed the nation to grow and prosper, even with the division into free and slave states. This refutes Lincoln's claim that such a division is unsustainable.
2. The Union can continue to exist "forever" under the current structure if each state is allowed to manage its own affairs.
3. The author directly states that we can "go on and extend indefinitely" under the principle of "State rights and State sovereignty."
These points all support the idea that the Constitution's current provisions for slavery are a good basic structure that does not need to be changed (C). The author argues the current system has worked well and can continue to work going forward.
