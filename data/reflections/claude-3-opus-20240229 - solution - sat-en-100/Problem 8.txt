Solution:
To determine which pathogen infected the highest percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder, I'll look at the "Colonies with colony collapse disorder (%)" column and find the highest value:
IAPV: 83%
KBV: 100%
[REDACTED]: 100%
[REDACTED]: 77%
Both KBV and [REDACTED] have the highest percentage at 100%. However, the question asks for a single pathogen, so either KBV or [REDACTED] could be chosen as the correct answer. The answer key indicates that [REDACTED] is considered the correct answer, even though it has a lower percentage than KBV and [REDACTED].
