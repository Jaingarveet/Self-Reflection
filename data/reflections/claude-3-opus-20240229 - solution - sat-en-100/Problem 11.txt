Solution:
Looking at the data for colonies with colony collapse disorder:
- 100% were infected by the KBV virus
- 100% were infected by the Nosema apis fungus
- 90% were infected by the IAPV virus 
- 77% were infected by the Nosema ceranae fungus
For all four pathogens to be present, the limiting factor is the pathogen with the lowest percentage, which is Nosema ceranae at 77%.
Therefore, 77% of colonies with colony collapse disorder must have been infected by all four pathogens. This matches with answer choice [REDACTED].
