Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not accurately understand the differentiation between the third position and the second one. I thought the third position was differentiated from both the first and second positions, but the passage primarily differentiates the third position from the second one.
Error Keywords:
- Comprehension error
- Differentiation error
- Position identification error
Solution:
The passage presents three positions on the role of art and literature. The first two positions are briefly described, while the third position, which is Dostoyevsky's, is elaborated in detail. The passage primarily differentiates Dostoyevsky's view from the second position, the radical critics' view, by discussing Dostoyevsky's disagreement with their insistence on art's utility and their understanding of reality.
Instructions:
1. Identify the positions presented in the passage.
2. Understand the characteristics of each position.
3. Identify which position is elaborated in detail.
4. Identify from which position the detailed position is primarily differentiated.
5. Choose the answer that accurately describes the organization of the material in the passage.
Advice:
- Always read the passage carefully and understand the positions presented.
- Pay attention to the details of each position and how they are differentiated.
- Understand the organization of the material in the passage.
- Be careful not to make assumptions about the superiority or inferiority of positions unless explicitly stated in the passage.
