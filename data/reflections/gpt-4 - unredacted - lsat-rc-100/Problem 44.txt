Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused on the multiple purposes of proverbs mentioned in the passage, but overlooked the part that states the use of proverbs is also shaped by the larger community. This led me to choose an answer that was too broad and not directly supported by the passage.
Error Keywords:
- Reading comprehension error
- Contextual understanding error
- Overgeneralization error
Solution:
The passage states that "Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs." It also mentions that "proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts." Therefore, the correct answer is B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
