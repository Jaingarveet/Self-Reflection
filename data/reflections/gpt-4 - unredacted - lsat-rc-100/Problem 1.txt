Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I misinterpreted the question. I focused on the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, which argues against using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures. However, the question asked for what would be objectionable to the proponents of the version discussed in the third paragraph, not its critics. 
Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Reading comprehension error
- Contextual understanding error
Solution:
The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods for examination. However, it does not advocate for using the theories of one society to criticize another society with different values. Therefore, a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values (Choice D) would be objectionable to these proponents.
