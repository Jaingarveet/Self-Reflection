## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:**
I incorrectly recalled the redox state of NADH in the context of anaerobic glycolysis. I should have remembered that NADH is reduced, while NAD is the oxidized form. 
**Error Keywords:**
*   Factual error
*   Biochemistry knowledge gap
*   Redox state confusion 
**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Recall the process:** Anaerobic glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose without oxygen, resulting in the production of ATP.
2.  **Identify key molecules:** The process involves NAD+, which acts as an electron carrier.
3.  **Consider redox reactions:** During glycolysis, NAD+ is reduced to NADH by accepting electrons.
4.  **Analyze end products:** Therefore, the end products of anaerobic glycolysis include 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules (the reduced form of NAD+).
**Instructions for Future:**
1.  Review the fundamentals of redox reactions and the roles of NAD+/NADH.
2.  Pay close attention to the specific molecules involved in each metabolic pathway.
3.  Differentiate between oxidized and reduced forms of electron carriers.
4.  Practice applying knowledge to different biochemical scenarios.
**General Advice:**
*   **Strengthen foundational knowledge:** Ensure a solid understanding of core concepts before tackling complex topics.
*   **Focus on details:** Pay attention to subtle differences between molecules and processes.
*   **Visualize the process:** Use diagrams or mental imagery to understand the flow of reactions.
*   **Practice active recall:** Regularly test your knowledge to reinforce learning.
