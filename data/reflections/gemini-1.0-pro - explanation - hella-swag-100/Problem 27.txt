Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the most likely completion was the one that described the man continuing to fly kites. However, the correct answer is the one that describes the man walking away with a woman speaking to the crowd. This is because the text states that the man is flying kites "around in the middle" of the auditorium, which suggests that he is performing for an audience. The woman speaking to the crowd is likely the host or organizer of the event, and the man is probably walking away after his performance is over.
