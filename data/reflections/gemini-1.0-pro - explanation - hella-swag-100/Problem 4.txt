Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the most likely completion to the text. 
I focused on the specific steps for writing a story about the relationship, rather than the overall goal of breaking a trauma bond. 
The correct answer, writing the story in the third person, is more likely to help the writer gain perspective on the relationship and break the trauma bond.
