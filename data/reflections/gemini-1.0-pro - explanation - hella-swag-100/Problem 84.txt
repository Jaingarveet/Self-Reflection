Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the next step in the recipe would be to remove the eggplant from the salted water. However, the correct answer is to drain the eggplant after 10 minutes and leave it to one side for later use. This is because the eggplant needs to be patted dry before being coated in the egg mixture.
