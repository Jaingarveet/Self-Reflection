   - Choice [REDACTED]: Mentions promo codes but lacks context and does not provide clear guidance on obtaining free minutes. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: Refers to finding and using codes but does not align with the guide format and does not offer a practical method for obtaining codes. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: Provides a practical suggestion to search online for codes specific to one's prepaid phone service provider, offering a direct path to the desired outcome. 
   - Choice [REDACTED]: Is illogical and irrelevant, as it suggests an impossible task of creating promotion codes by the customer.
