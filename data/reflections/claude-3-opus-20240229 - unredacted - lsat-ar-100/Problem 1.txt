Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice E was possible, but it actually violates the conditions. I failed to consider that if Jackson testifies on Tuesday, and two witnesses testify on Monday, then the condition that exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday would be violated.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Constraint violation
 - Overlooking stated conditions
 - Witness scheduling error
Solution:
Given:
- 5 witnesses: Franco, Garcia, Hong, Iturbe, Jackson 
- 3 days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
- Each witness testifies exactly once
- Franco and Garcia do not testify on the same day
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday 
- Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday
- Hong does not testify on Monday
- At least 1 witness testifies on Monday
Analyzing the choices:
A) Possible. Franco on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, Garcia and Iturbe on Wednesday.
B) Not possible. Iturbe testifies Wednesday, Franco can't be same day as Garcia.
C) Possible. Garcia and Hong on Tuesday, 1-2 on Monday, Iturbe + 0-1 other on Wednesday. 
D) Possible. Garcia on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, Hong and Iturbe on Wednesday.
E) Not possible. If Jackson is on Tuesday, and 2 are on Monday, then <2 would be on Tuesday.
Therefore, E CANNOT be true.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed constraints that must be met.
3. Analyze each answer choice one by one.
4. For each choice, check if it violates any of the given constraints.
5. If a choice violates a constraint, rule it out as a possibility.
6. Choose the answer that cannot be possible without violating constraints.
Advice:
- Always read the constraints carefully and identify the non-negotiable ones.
- Consider the implications of each constraint on the possible scenarios.
- Methodically test each answer choice against the constraints.
- Be careful not to introduce unstated assumptions.
- Double-check that your answer does not introduce any constraint violations.
