Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible arrangements of breeds on each day. I focused on one possible arrangement without considering all the constraints. Specifically, I didn't properly account for the fact that any breed featured on day 1 cannot be featured on day 7.
Error Keywords:
 - Incomplete constraint analysis
 - Focused on single arrangement
 - Ignored day 1 / day 7 constraint
 - Logical reasoning error
Solution:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can't be featured on any other day, including day 7.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or day 7. So they must be featured on three of days 2-6.
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. 
4. No breed can be featured on two consecutive days.
5. If Himalayans are on days 2, 4, 6, then Rottweilers must be on days 3, 5. Manx/Siamese on 1, 7.
6. If Himalayans are on days 3, 5, then Rottweilers can only be on day 4. Manx/Siamese on 1, 2, 6, 7.
7. In both cases, days 2 and 6 must feature different breeds, either Himalayan/Newfoundland or Manx/Siamese and Newfoundland.
8. All other pairs of days in the choices could potentially feature the same breeds in some arrangement.
Therefore, days 2 and 6 CANNOT feature both the same breed of kitten and puppy.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints. List out all the key facts.
2. Identify the specific item the question is asking for (e.g., pair of days that cannot have same breeds).
3. Systematically consider the implications of each constraint on the possible arrangements.
4. Consider multiple possible arrangements that satisfy the constraints.
5. For each answer choice, check if it could be true in any valid arrangement.
6. Eliminate choices that could be true in some valid arrangement.
7. Select the choice that must be false in all valid arrangements.
Advice:
 - Always read the constraints carefully and consider their implications.
 - Don't focus on a single arrangement; consider multiple possibilities.
 - Systematically analyze each constraint and its logical consequences.
 - Consider the specific question being asked and how the constraints relate to it.
 - Eliminate answer choices that could be true; select the one that must be false.
 - If stuck, try working backwards from the answer choices.
