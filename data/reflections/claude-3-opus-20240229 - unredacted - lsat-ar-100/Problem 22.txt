Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that if both G and H were selected, the panel could include either F or M as the chemist. However, I overlooked the condition that if M is selected, both P and R must also be selected. This would violate the rule that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, if both G and H are selected, the chemist must be either F or K, not M.
Error Keywords:
 - Overlooked constraint
 - Violated condition
 - Incorrect deduction
 - Faulty reasoning
Solution:
1. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type (botanist, chemist, zoologist).
2. If both G and H are selected (two botanists), then at most one zoologist can be selected. 
3. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.
4. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
5. If both G and H are selected, M cannot be selected as the chemist because that would require selecting both P and R, violating the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected.
6. Therefore, if both G and H are selected, the chemist must be either F or K.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all the conditions and constraints.
2. Identify the key information given in the question.
3. Consider each condition one by one and think through the implications.
4. Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the given conditions.
5. If a condition leads to a contradiction with another condition, that scenario is not possible.
6. Choose the answer that satisfies all the conditions and constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and note all the conditions and constraints.
 - Consider the implications of each condition and constraint separately.
 - Look for contradictions that arise when combining different conditions.
 - Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the given conditions.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or overlook any given information.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure it is logically sound and consistent with all the given conditions.
