Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Wayne must perform at least one traditional piece. However, upon re-reading the question and conditions, I realize there is no explicit requirement for Wayne to perform any traditional pieces. My error was in making an assumption not supported by the given information.
Error Keywords:
 - Unsupported assumption
 - Misinterpretation of conditions
 - Failure to consider all possibilities
Solution:
1. The third solo is a traditional piece. This could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. This means that either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and fourth solos are traditional.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. This means that if the third and fourth solos are traditional, then Wayne could perform the fourth solo, but he doesn't have to.
4. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. This doesn't directly affect the number of traditional pieces Wayne performs.
5. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means that Wayne must perform a modern piece before any traditional piece is performed, but it doesn't require him to perform any traditional pieces.
6. One possible scenario that satisfies all conditions is: 
   - First solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
   - Second solo: Zara performs a modern piece
   - Third solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - Fourth solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - Fifth solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
7. In this scenario, Wayne performs zero traditional pieces, which is the minimum possible.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the key information and conditions.
2. Consider each condition separately and think about its implications.
3. Be careful not to make any assumptions that are not explicitly supported by the given information.
4. Consider all possible scenarios that satisfy the given conditions.
5. Identify the scenario that minimizes the quantity in question (in this case, the number of traditional pieces performed by Wayne).
6. Double-check that your identified scenario satisfies all given conditions.
7. Choose the answer that matches the minimum value from your identified scenario.
Advice:
 - Always read the question and conditions carefully, and make sure you understand them fully before attempting to solve the problem.
 - Be careful not to make any unsupported assumptions. Only use the information that is explicitly given.
 - Consider all possibilities that satisfy the given conditions. Don't stop at the first scenario you find.
 - When trying to minimize or maximize a quantity, consider extreme scenarios that push the boundaries of the conditions.
 - Always double-check your reasoning and make sure your answer satisfies all the given conditions.
