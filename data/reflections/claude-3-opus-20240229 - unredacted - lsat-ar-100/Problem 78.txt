Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the possible scenarios given the constraints. I incorrectly concluded that Nina must give her report on Wednesday, which led me to incorrectly choose answer E. I failed to consider all possible valid scenarios.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incomplete analysis of constraints
 - Failure to consider all possible scenarios
Solution:
1. George must give his report on Tuesday, as that's the only day he can do so.
2. Robert cannot give an afternoon report. 
3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.
4. Let's consider the scenario where Nina gives her report on Monday:
   - Nina gives her report on Monday
   - Helen and Irving must then give their reports on Tuesday
   - George gives his report on Tuesday
   - Robert can give his report on Wednesday morning
5. In this scenario, all the constraints are satisfied. Importantly, Helen gives a report on Wednesday, so answer A is a possible scenario.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed constraints (e.g. George must present on Tuesday).
3. Consider each answer choice one-by-one.
4. For each choice, try to construct a scenario that satisfies all the constraints.
5. If you can find a valid scenario, then that answer choice is possible.
6. If you cannot find a valid scenario after thorough consideration, then that answer choice is impossible.
7. Choose the answer that represents a possible scenario.
Advice:
 - Always carefully read and re-read the question and constraints.
 - Always consider each answer choice methodically.
 - Always try to construct concrete scenarios to test each answer choice.
 - Never assume an answer is impossible until you have thoroughly tried to find a valid scenario.
 - Always double-check that your chosen scenario satisfies all the given constraints.
 - Remember that for "could be true" questions, you only need to find one possible valid scenario.
