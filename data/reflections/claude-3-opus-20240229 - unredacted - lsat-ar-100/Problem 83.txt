Explanation:
I incorrectly determined that choice A was possible given the constraints. I failed to consider that if Julio leads Wednesday morning and Kevin leads Thursday or Friday morning, then Lan cannot lead Wednesday morning because Lan and Olivia must lead on different days, and Olivia must lead on a later day than Julio.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Constraint satisfaction error
 - Scheduling conflict
 - Overlooked constraint
Solution:
Given:
1. Julio and Kevin both lead morning sessions.
2. Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
3. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
4. Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
5. Julio's session must be on an earlier day than Olivia's.
If Julio leads Wednesday morning and Kevin leads Thursday or Friday morning, then:
 - Rebecca must lead the afternoon session on the same day as Kevin (Thursday or Friday).
 - Olivia must lead on a later day than Julio (Thursday or Friday).
 - Lan must lead on a different day than Olivia.
 - The only day left for Lan is Wednesday, and it must be the afternoon session since Julio has the morning.
 - Nessa will lead the remaining afternoon session (Thursday or Friday).
Therefore, Lan cannot lead the Wednesday morning session, so choice A is the exception - it cannot be true.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and constraints.
2. Identify the fixed assignments based on the given information.
3. Systematically consider each remaining choice and test if it can satisfy all constraints.
4. For each choice, mentally assign the lab assistants to sessions chronologically, checking for conflicts at each step.
5. If a choice leads to an impossible situation or conflict, it cannot be true.
6. Choose the answer that cannot be true based on the given constraints.
Advice:
 - In constraint satisfaction problems, always consider the most restrictive conditions first.
 - Mentally simulate the schedule chronologically, assigning roles one at a time.
 - At each step, check if any constraints are violated before proceeding.
 - If a partial assignment leads to an irreconcilable conflict, backtrack and consider a different assignment.
 - Be sure to consider all constraints for each possible choice before deciding if it can be true or not.
 - Don't rush to judgment; carefully reason through each choice step-by-step.
