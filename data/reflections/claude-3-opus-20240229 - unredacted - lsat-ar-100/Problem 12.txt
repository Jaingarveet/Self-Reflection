Explanation:
I incorrectly analyzed the constraints on when houses J and K could be shown. I failed to recognize that since J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpreting constraints
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Overlooking key information
 - Incorrect deduction
Solution:
The problem states that J must be shown in the evening, which means it will be either the 6th or 7th house shown.
It also states that K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in either the afternoon (3rd, 4th, or 5th) or evening (6th or 7th).
Since J is always in the evening and K is never in the morning, there is no way for J and K to be shown consecutively. If K is shown in the afternoon, it will not be next to J. If K is shown in the evening, it can only be 6th if J is 7th, or 7th if J is 6th.
Therefore, J and K cannot be shown consecutively in either order, making A the correct answer.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the problem and note all constraints on the order of events.
2. Identify the specific constraints on each individual element (house).
3. Consider the possible positions for each element based on its constraints.
4. For each answer choice, check if the pair of elements can be placed consecutively while satisfying all constraints.
5. Eliminate answer choices that allow the pair to be consecutive.
6. Select the answer choice that cannot be consecutive due to the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and identify all given constraints.
 - Always consider the implications of each individual constraint.
 - Always think through the possible positions or orders for each element.
 - Always methodically consider each answer choice against the constraints.
 - Remember that "cannot be consecutive" means there is no possible order where the elements are next to each other.
 - If the constraints on two elements prevent them from ever being consecutive, then that is likely the correct answer.
