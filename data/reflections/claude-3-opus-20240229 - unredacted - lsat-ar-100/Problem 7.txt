Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning. I incorrectly concluded that the scenario was impossible if Jackson was the only witness on Monday. However, it is possible to schedule the other witnesses to meet all the conditions.
Error Keywords:
 - Logical reasoning error
 - Incorrect inference
 - Overlooked possible solution
Solution:
1. Jackson is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday.
2. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
3. This leaves Franco, Garcia, and Hong to testify on Tuesday.
4. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
5. Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
6. Therefore, Hong and either Franco or Garcia must testify on Tuesday.
7. Since the question asks what must be true, Hong testifying on Tuesday is the only certain conclusion.
Instructions:
1. Carefully read the question and note all the given conditions.
2. Identify the fixed elements of the schedule (e.g., Jackson on Monday, Iturbe on Wednesday).
3. Determine the possible placements for the remaining witnesses.
4. Consider each condition and eliminate placements that violate the conditions.
5. Look for conclusions that must be true based on the remaining possible placements.
6. Select the answer choice that matches a necessary conclusion.
Advice:
 - Always consider all possible scenarios before concluding that something is impossible.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are not certain conclusions based on the given information.
 - If a question asks what must be true, look for the answer choice that is true in all possible scenarios.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or inferences beyond what the information strictly implies.
 - In scheduling problems, start with the most constrained elements and work towards the less constrained ones.
