Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the distribution of representatives across the zones. I incorrectly assumed that for Zone 1 to have the most representatives, it must have at least 3. However, this is not necessarily true. Zone 1 could have just 2 representatives and still be the zone with the most if Zones 2 and 3 each have only 1 representative.
Error Keywords:
 - Incorrect assumption
 - Faulty logic
 - Distribution error
 - Zonal allocation error
Solution:
1. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
2. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
4. The question states that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
5. The only way for more representatives to be in Zone 1 than Zone 3, while still having more in Zone 3 than Zone 2, is if Zone 1 has 2 representatives, Zone 3 has 1, and Zone 2 has 0.
6. For this to happen, Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 1 (since they must be together), Tiao must also be in Zone 1 (since either Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1), and Udall must be in Zone 3 (since Stuckey and Udall must be together).
7. This leaves Stuckey in Zone 3, and Kim and Mahr to be distributed among the zones.
8. The only answer choice that could be true in this scenario is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and note all the given conditions.
2. Identify the key constraints and relationships between the entities (representatives and zones in this case).
3. Consider the implications of each condition on the possible arrangements.
4. Analyze the specific scenario presented in the question (more in Zone 1 than Zone 3).
5. Systematically work through the possible arrangements that satisfy all the conditions and the given scenario.
6. Eliminate the arrangements that contradict any of the conditions.
7. Among the remaining valid arrangements, check which of the given answer choices could be true.
8. Select the answer choice that fits the scenario and satisfies all the conditions.
Advice:
 - Always consider all the given conditions and constraints in the problem.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions that go beyond the given information.
 - Think through the implications of each condition systematically.
 - Consider edge cases and extreme scenarios that still satisfy the conditions.
 - Eliminate answer choices that contradict any of the given conditions.
 - Double-check your reasoning to ensure you haven't overlooked any conditions or made any logical errors.
