Explanation:
I made an error in my reasoning about the constraints on the Himalayan kittens. I correctly identified that Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days, but I incorrectly assumed that they could not be featured on consecutive days. The problem states that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, but this applies to all breeds collectively, not to each individual breed. My misinterpretation of this rule led me to eliminate correct answer E and incorrectly choose C.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of constraints
 - Incorrect assumption about breed featuring rules
 - Misapplication of non-consecutive day rule
Solution:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so a kitten breed must be featured on day 2.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. 
3. No breed (kitten or puppy) is featured on any two consecutive days. This means that the same kitten breed cannot be featured on consecutive days, but different kitten breeds can.
4. Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. This doesn't directly affect the kitten breeds.
5. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. This means the kitten breed featured on day 1 (if any) can't be featured on day 7.
Looking at the choices again:
A: Violates the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
B: Violates the condition that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
C: Violates the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
D: Violates the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
E: Satisfies all conditions. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days (2, 4, 7), no kitten breed is repeated on consecutive days, and the breed featured on day 1 (Siamese) is not featured on day 7.
Therefore, the correct answer is E.
Instructions:
1. Read the problem carefully and list out all the constraints.
2. Analyze each constraint separately and understand its implications.
3. Be careful not to make assumptions or misinterpret the constraints.
4. Eliminate answer choices that violate any of the constraints.
5. Choose the answer that satisfies all the constraints.
Advice:
 - Always read the problem carefully and understand all the constraints before attempting to solve.
 - Be careful not to make unwarranted assumptions or misinterpret the constraints.
 - Consider each constraint individually and think through its implications.
 - Eliminate answers methodically by checking each against the constraints.
 - The correct answer must satisfy all the constraints given in the problem.
