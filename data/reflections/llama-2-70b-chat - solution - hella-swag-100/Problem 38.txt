Solution:
The text describes a man in the kitchen preparing food, specifically mentioning seasonings and swishing a pan.
The most likely completion would be a video of the man continuing to prepare a meal, not introducing a baking segment (A), showing multiple videos of food (B), showing an aerobics video (C), or suddenly showing pasta pouring out of a pot (D).
The correct answer is (B) because it matches the context of a cooking show introduction.
