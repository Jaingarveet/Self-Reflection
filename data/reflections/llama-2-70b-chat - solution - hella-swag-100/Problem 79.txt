Solution:
[REDACTED] dog is in a tub, being sprayed with soap before being rubbed down, and finally, rinsed clean.
The sentence describes a dog being bathed, and the phrase "a closing image" suggests that it is the final step of the bathing process.
The most likely completion would be a description of the dog being rinsed clean, perhaps with a closing image of the dog shaking off excess water.
Instead, the correct answer is [REDACTED], which provides additional information about the wash.
