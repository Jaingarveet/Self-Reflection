Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite causing falciparum malaria, preferentially invades senescent red blood cells. However, it is actually Plasmodium malariae, the parasite responsible for quartan malaria, that has a greater affinity for older, senescent red blood cells. My knowledge gap was in the specific red blood cell preferences of different malaria parasites.
