Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the isthmus as the narrowest part of the uterine tube. While the isthmus is indeed narrow, I failed to consider that the interstitial portion, which passes through the uterine wall, is even narrower. My knowledge gap was in the relative sizes of the different segments of the uterine tube.
