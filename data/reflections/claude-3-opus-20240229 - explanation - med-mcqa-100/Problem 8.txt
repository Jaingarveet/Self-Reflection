Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that "unknown chances" was a key aspect of randomness in the context of randomization. However, in a properly designed randomized study, the chances of being assigned to each group are both equal and known.
My error was in confusing the concepts of unpredictability (unknown outcome) with unknown probability. While the actual group assignment for each subject is unknown and unpredictable before randomization occurs, the probability of being assigned to any particular group is known and equal for all subjects.
