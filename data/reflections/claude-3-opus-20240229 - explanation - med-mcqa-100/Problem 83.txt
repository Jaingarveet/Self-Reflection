Explanation:
I incorrectly chose the buttocks as the best site for harvesting split skin grafts in young children. While the buttocks meet many of the criteria for a good donor site, the thigh is actually the preferred location. I failed to consider that the thigh has a larger surface area and can yield more graft tissue than the buttocks. Additionally, the thigh is less prone to contamination and infection compared to the buttocks.
