Explanation:
I incorrectly selected petroleum jellies as the best treatment for post-radiation desquamation. While petroleum jellies can help soothe the skin, observation alone is actually the most appropriate management for this condition in most cases. I overestimated the severity of desquamation and the need for active intervention.
