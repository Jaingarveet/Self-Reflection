Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that all the listed investigations would be useful for diagnosing and evaluating spondylolisthesis. While lateral X-ray, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] are indeed valuable, I failed to recognize that anteroposterior (AP) X-ray is not particularly helpful in this condition. The key diagnostic feature of spondylolisthesis is the forward slippage of one vertebra over another, which is best visualized on a lateral view X-ray. AP X-rays do not provide the necessary perspective to assess this slippage.
