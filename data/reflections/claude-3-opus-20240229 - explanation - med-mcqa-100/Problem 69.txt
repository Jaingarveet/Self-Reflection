Explanation:
I answered this question incorrectly because I did not have enough information about the specific clinical features mentioned in the question stem. Without knowing the details of the clinical presentation, I could not definitively determine which amino acid deficiency was the most likely cause. I made an educated guess based on the rarity of cysteine deficiency, but this was not sufficient to arrive at the correct answer, which was tryptophan deficiency.
