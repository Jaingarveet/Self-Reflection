Explanation:
I incorrectly chose [REDACTED] as the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's age, symptoms, and the mention of biopsy findings. However, I failed to consider that the question stem specifically mentioned that biopsy findings were provided, which would be crucial in distinguishing between the different granulomatous conditions. Without actually seeing the biopsy findings, I should not have assumed [REDACTED] was the correct answer.
