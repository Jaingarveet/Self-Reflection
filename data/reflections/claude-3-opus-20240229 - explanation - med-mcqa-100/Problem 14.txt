Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the end products of anaerobic glycolysis. While I correctly stated that glycolysis produces [REDACTED] and 2 NADH, I failed to account for the fact that in anaerobic conditions, the NADH is oxidized back to NAD+ to allow glycolysis to continue. My knowledge gap was in understanding the regeneration of NAD+ in anaerobic conditions.
