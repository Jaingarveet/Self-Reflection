Explanation:
I incorrectly recalled the recommended daily dose of iron and folic acid for pregnant women under the MCH program. While I correctly remembered the folic acid dose of 500 mcg, I mistakenly thought the iron dose was 60 mg instead of the correct 100 mg. This error was due to a gap in my knowledge of the specific dosage recommendations.
