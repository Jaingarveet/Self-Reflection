Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that a 'liver shrinkage diet' is most commonly used before liver resections. While such a diet can be beneficial before liver surgery, it is more routinely used prior to bariatric surgery. I focused too narrowly on liver-related procedures and did not give enough consideration to the other options.
