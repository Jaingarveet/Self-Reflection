Explanation:
I incorrectly chose the liver as the site of islet cell transplantation, when in fact the correct answer is that the cells are injected into the portal vein. My reasoning about the liver being a good site for transplantation was sound, but I failed to distinguish between the liver parenchyma and the portal vein that supplies it. The key fact I was missing is that the cells are introduced into the portal vein, not directly into the liver tissue.
