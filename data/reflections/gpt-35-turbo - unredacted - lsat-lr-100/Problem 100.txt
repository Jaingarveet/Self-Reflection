Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question by choosing option D instead of option A. I misunderstood the argument and chose an answer that did not directly support the idea that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery. Instead, I chose an answer that provided evidence that the harm to the victim is the same in both cases. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding the argument
 - Choosing an answer that is not directly related to the argument
 - Focusing on a specific detail instead of the main idea
Solution:
The argument is that lawmakers in some jurisdictions consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery because they have instituted identical penalties for both crimes. To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that the harm resulting from theft is indeed equal to the harm resulting from bribery. 
Option A provides evidence that supports the idea that lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes. If lawmakers believe that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery, then it makes sense for them to institute identical penalties for both crimes. 
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the argument.
2. Identify the main idea of the argument.
3. Read each answer choice carefully and identify the one that directly supports the main idea.
4. Eliminate answer choices that are not directly related to the argument.
5. Choose the answer choice that provides evidence that supports the main idea.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the argument.
 - Identify the main idea of the argument.
 - Read each answer choice carefully and eliminate those that are not directly related to the argument.
 - Choose the answer choice that provides evidence that supports the main idea.
 - Be careful not to focus on a specific detail instead of the main idea.
