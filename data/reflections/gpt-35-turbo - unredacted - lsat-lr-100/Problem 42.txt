Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice D because I did not fully understand the argumentative technique employed in the passage. The author is not advocating for a factic that would help the group reach a consensus, but rather suggesting a way to make an accusation stick. The author is conditionally advocating for a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion. The author is suggesting that the term "unyielding" is the best choice for an accusation because it is difficult to deny that someone has not yielded.
