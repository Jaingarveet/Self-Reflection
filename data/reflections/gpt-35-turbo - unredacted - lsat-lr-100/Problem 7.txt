Explanation:
I incorrectly chose option A because it presents a choice between two options and eliminates one based on a specific reason. However, the reason for eliminating one option in option A is different from the reason for eliminating one option in the radio producer's argument. In option A, the more expensive option is eliminated because of cost concerns, while in the radio producer's argument, the less popular option is eliminated because it does not generate enough revenue. Option B is the most similar in pattern of reasoning to the radio producer's argument because it presents a choice between two options and eliminates one based on a specific reason that is relevant to the situation at hand.
Error Keywords:

 - Pattern recognition error
 - Specific reason error
Solution:
The radio producer is faced with a choice between two options, one of which is more popular but less loyal, and the other is less popular but more loyal. The producer chooses the more popular option because it generates more revenue. Option B is the most similar in pattern of reasoning to the radio producer's argument because it presents a choice between two options and eliminates one based on a specific reason that is relevant to the situation at hand.
