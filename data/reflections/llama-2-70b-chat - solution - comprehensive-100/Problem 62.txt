Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination.
By substitution, we have:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\2 y-x=-19\end{array}$$
Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get:
$$3x + 4(2y - x) = -23$$
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
$$3x + 8y - 4x = -23$$
$$-x + 8y = -27$$
Solving for x and y, we get:
$$x = 3$$
$$y = -8$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(3, -8)$.
