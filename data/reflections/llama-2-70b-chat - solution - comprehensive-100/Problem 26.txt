Solution:
Given that the shoe store is in space 2, we can start by placing the pharmacy in space 1, as it must be at one end of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so we can place one of them in space 3 and the other in space 6. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so we can place the optometrist in space 4 and the veterinarian in space 5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can place it in space 7.
