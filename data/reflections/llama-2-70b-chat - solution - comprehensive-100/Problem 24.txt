Solution:
Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. Exactly six students will give individual oral reports.
2. Exactly two reports will be given each day.
3. Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so George will give a morning report on Tuesday.
4. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
5. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
6. Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we need to find the morning reports for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
7. Olivia can give a morning report on Monday, and Robert can give a morning report on Wednesday.
8. George can give a morning report on Tuesday.
9. Helen can give a morning report on Wednesday.
10. Irving can give a morning report on Monday.
