Solution:
We can solve the system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. Solving the first equation for x, we get x = -3y - 14. Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

3(-3y - 14) - 2y = -6

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

-9y - 42 = -6

Adding 9y to both sides, we get:

[REDACTED]2 = -6

Therefore, the value of x - y is not defined, since we have a contradiction.
