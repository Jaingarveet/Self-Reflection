Solution:
We can start by expanding the given expression:

$(a x+2)(b x+7) = a b x^{2} + (a+b) x + 2 b x + 14$

Since $a+b=8$, we can substitute this into the expression above:

$a b x^{2} + (8) x + 2 b x + 14 = 15 x^{2} + c x + 14$

Now, equating the coefficients of the two expressions, we get:

$a b = 15$
$2 b = c$

Solving for $a$ and $b$, we get:

$a = 5$
$b = 3$

Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are:

$c = 2 \times 3 = 6$
$c = 5 \times 3 = 15$
