Solution:
From (1), we know that Prince Lima is tall, handsome, and a doctor.
From (2), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are both doctors.
From (3), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are the same height.
From (4), we know that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are not both tall.

We can deduce that [REDACTED] is not tall, and [REDACTED] is tall.
[REDACTED] is a doctor, and we know that he is tall because [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are the same height, and [REDACTED] is not a doctor.
Therefore, [REDACTED] meets all of Li Na's requirements.
