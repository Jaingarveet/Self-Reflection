I incorrectly assumed that the editorial's criticism of the party's inconsistency was based on the assumption that it is inconsistent to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education. However, the editorial's criticism is actually based on the assumption that a consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
