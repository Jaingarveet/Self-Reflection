Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption on which the argument depends. 
My error was in assuming that the argument relies on the claim that non-native speakers hear speech more accurately than native speakers. 
However, the argument actually relies on the claim that native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than the perceptions of non-native speakers.
