Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the assumption that supports the argument's conclusion. 
My error was in focusing on the behavior of rational consumers rather than their expectations. 
The argument claims that consumers who do not bother to acquire information are behaving rationally because they do not expect the benefits to outweigh the costs. 
I mistakenly focused on the statement that it is rational not to acquire information, overlooking the crucial element of expectations.
