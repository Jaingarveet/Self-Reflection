Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that the most important factor in evaluating the argument was the likelihood of cocker spaniels straying. However, the key factor is whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods. If residents of Flynn Heights are less likely to license their dogs, then the argument is weaker. This is because the fact that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in Flynn Heights may not be a reliable indicator of the actual number of cocker spaniels in the neighborhood.
