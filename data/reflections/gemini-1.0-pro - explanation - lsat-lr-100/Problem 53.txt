Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the main point of Wexell's argument and the vulnerability of Robinson's response. 
I focused on the claim about the artistic significance of the props and costumes, while the main point of Wexell's argument was that the museum wasted its money by purchasing items that have no use outside of a performance. 
Robinson's response fails to address this point.
