Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the reasoning error in the argument. 
The argument assumes that because Hana received a recording from her brothers, they must have been at her party. However, it is possible that they gave her the recording without attending the party. 
The argument fails to establish that something true of some people (Hana's brothers who gave her the recording) is true of only those people (Hana's brothers who attended her party).
