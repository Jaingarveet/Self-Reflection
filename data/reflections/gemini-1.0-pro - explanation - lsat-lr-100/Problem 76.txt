Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the argument that most closely resembled the original argument. 
My error was in failing to recognize that the original argument was about the desirability of a certain action (adopting a fish-based diet) and the undesirable consequences of its universal adoption. 
Only two of the answer choices shared this structure: [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. 
I chose [REDACTED] because it was the first answer choice that seemed to fit this structure, but I failed to consider the other answer choices carefully enough.
