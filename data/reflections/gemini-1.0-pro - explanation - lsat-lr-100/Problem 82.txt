Explanation:
I incorrectly identified the strongest counter-argument Patricia could make to Tamara's objection. 
My error stemmed from a misunderstanding of the context and the specific claims being made. 
While I correctly recognized that Patricia was disputing the prevalence of ninja activity, I failed to grasp the significance of the population distribution during the Tokugawa period.
