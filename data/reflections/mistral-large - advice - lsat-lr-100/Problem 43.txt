Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the conclusion, argument, and assumption in a logical argument.
 - Always think through the logical structure of the argument step-by-step.
 - Never focus solely on the subject matter of the argument; consider its logical structure.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the argument and the assumption required for the conclusion to follow.
 - Remember that the assumption required for a conclusion to follow logically may not be explicitly stated in the argument.
