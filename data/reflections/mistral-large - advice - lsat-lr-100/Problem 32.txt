Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the argument and the assumption underlying the argument.
 - Always evaluate each answer choice to determine which one best represents the assumption underlying the argument.
 - Never focus on the wrong aspect of the argument.
 - Always double-check your answer to ensure accuracy.
 - Remember that the assumption underlying the argument is often not explicitly stated in the argument itself.
