Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the logical fallacy in the original argument.
 - Always compare the pattern of flawed reasoning in each choice to the original argument.
 - Always double-check your understanding of the logical fallacy in the original argument and the choice you have identified as most similar.
 - Remember that the logical fallacy of undistributed middle occurs when a term is not distributed in either or both of the premises but is distributed in the conclusion.
