Explanation:
I misinterpreted the problem and assumed that walking 20 steps at a certain speed would result in a shorter total time than walking 10 steps at the same speed. However, the problem states that walking 20 steps results in a longer total time of 10 minutes. This indicates that the elevator's speed is indeed a factor in the descent.
