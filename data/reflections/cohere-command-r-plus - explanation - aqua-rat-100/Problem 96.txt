Explanation:
I made a calculation error in determining the number of months [REDACTED] joined after [REDACTED]. 
I incorrectly assumed that [REDACTED] and B's profits for 1[REDACTED] would be equal to their investments multiplied by the total profit divided by the total investment. 
However, I overlooked the fact that [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] had only invested for a portion of the year, and their profits should be calculated proportionally.
