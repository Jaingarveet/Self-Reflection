Explanation:
I misunderstood the question and the options provided. The task was to rearrange the given letters to form 7-letter words, but I focused on the fact that there were repeated letters and concluded it was not possible. I overlooked the fact that the question asks for permutations, which is why factorial values are provided as options.
