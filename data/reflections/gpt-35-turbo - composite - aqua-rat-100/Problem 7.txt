Explanation:
My mistake was that I did not consider the possibility of using a pair of the same letters to represent a type of book. 
If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she will need [REDACTED] letters. 
If she uses a pair of two different letters, she will need to choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first letter, and 1 letter out of 2[REDACTED] for the second letter (since the order of letters in a pair does not matter). This gives us 26*2[REDACTED]/2 = [REDACTED]2[REDACTED] possible pairs. 
If she uses a pair of the same letters, she will need to choose 1 letter out of 26. This gives us 26 possible pairs. 
Therefore, the total number of unique codes needed is [REDACTED].
