Explanation:
I made a calculation error. I calculated [REDACTED]% of the total number of matches played instead of [REDACTED]% of the matches lost. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Percentage error
 - Misinterpretation of the problem
Solution:
The team won 20 matches.
The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches.
To find the number of matches lost, we need to calculate [REDACTED]% of the total number of matches played.
[REDACTED]% of the total number of matches played is 0.[REDACTED]*(20+lost) = 6+0.[REDACTED]*lost.
We know that the team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, so 0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = lost.
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = lost = 0.[REDACTED]*(20+lost)
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = 6+0.[REDACTED]*lost
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches - 0.[REDACTED]*lost = 6
0.[REDACTED]*(total_matches - lost) = 6
total_matches - lost = 20
lost = 20 - total_matches
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches = 20 - total_matches
0.[REDACTED]*total_matches + total_matches = 20
1.[REDACTED]*total_matches = 20
total_matches = 20/1.[REDACTED]
total_matches = 1[REDACTED].[REDACTED]8
The team lost [REDACTED]% of their matches, which is 0.[REDACTED]*1[REDACTED].[REDACTED]8 = 4.61, rounded to [REDACTED].
