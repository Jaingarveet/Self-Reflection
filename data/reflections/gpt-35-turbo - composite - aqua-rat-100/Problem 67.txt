Explanation:
I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pita breads equivalent to two baguettes. 
I multiplied [REDACTED]/5 by [REDACTED] instead of [REDACTED]. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Conversion error
Solution:
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
We need to find [REDACTED] baguettes = ? pita breads
Let's start by finding the number of falafels in 1 roll.
6 pita breads = [REDACTED] rolls
So, 1 roll = 6/[REDACTED] = [REDACTED] pita breads
[REDACTED] rolls = 5 baguettes
So, 1 roll = 5/[REDACTED] baguettes
Therefore, 1 baguette = [REDACTED]/5 rolls = [REDACTED]/5 * [REDACTED] pita breads = 9/5 pita breads
[REDACTED] baguettes = [REDACTED] * 9/5 pita breads = 18/5 pita breads
So, [REDACTED] baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads.
We need to simplify this fraction.
18/5 = [REDACTED].6
18/5 = [REDACTED] [REDACTED]/5
Instructions:
1. Read the question carefully and understand the problem.
[REDACTED]. Identify the relationships between the different types of bread.
[REDACTED]. Use the given information to find the equivalent number of pita breads for one roll.
4. Use the given information to find the equivalent number of baguettes for one roll.
5. Use the equivalent number of pita breads for one roll to find the equivalent number of pita breads for one baguette.
6. Use the equivalent number of pita breads for one baguette to find the equivalent number of pita breads for two baguettes.
7. Simplify the resulting fraction if necessary.
8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the relationships between the different types of variables.
