Explanation:
I made a mistake in calculating the distance traveled by the plane when they meet. 
I multiplied the speed of the ship by the time instead of multiplying it by 10 times the time. 
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Multiplication error
 - Algebraic manipulation error
Solution:
Let's assume the speed of the ship is "s" and the time it takes to meet the plane is "t". 
The distance traveled by the ship before meeting the plane is 180 miles.
The distance traveled by the plane before meeting the ship is 10s*t.
The total distance traveled by the plane and the ship when they meet is the same and can be represented as s*t + 10s*t = 11s*t.
The distance traveled by the ship when they meet is s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: s*t = 180
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t, which can be calculated using the formula: 10s*t = 11s*t - 180
Solving for t, we get t = 20.
Substituting t in the formula s*t = 180, we get s = 9.
The distance traveled by the plane when they meet is 10s*t = 10*9*20 = 1800.
Therefore, the distance from the starting point when they meet is 180 + 1800 = 1980 miles.
Dividing 1980 by 10, we get 198.
