Explanation:
I used the correct method to add two numbers with different signs, but I made a calculation error.
The correct answer is +[REDACTED] because we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
The absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of [REDACTED].
So, we subtract 3[REDACTED] from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
The result is +[REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Addition error
 - Sign error
Solution:
To add +45 and [REDACTED], we subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and keep the sign of the larger number.
The absolute value of +45 is larger than the absolute value of [REDACTED].
So, we subtract 3[REDACTED] from 45 and keep the sign of +45, which is positive.
The result is +[REDACTED].
