Explanation:
I made a calculation error while finding the area of the field. 
I used the diameter instead of the radius to calculate the area of the field.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Area calculation error
 - Diameter instead of radius
Solution:
The rope tied to the cow is the radius of the circular area it can graze.
The area of the circle is pi*r^2, where r is the radius of the circle.
We need to find the area of the field and divide it by the area the cow can graze in a day.
The radius of the circle is 14/2 = 7 feet.
The area of the field is [REDACTED] = pi*r^2 = pi*7^2 = 153.94 sq.ft. (rounded to two decimal places)
The time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is T = A/10 = 15.39 days (rounded to two decimal places)
Instructions:
1. Identify the radius of the circle that the cow can graze.
2. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula [REDACTED] = pi*r^2.
3. Identify the area that the cow can graze in a day.
4. Divide the area of the field by the area that the cow can graze in a day.
5. Round the result to the nearest whole number or decimal place, as required.
6. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always use the correct formula for the problem.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that the radius of a circle is half of its diameter.
