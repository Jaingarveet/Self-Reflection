Explanation:
My mistake was in the calculation of the difference between the two contributions. 
The correct difference is (D/M) - ([REDACTED]) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Algebraic error
 - Subtraction error
Solution:
Let the initial contribution of each man be x.
So, the total contribution of M men would be Mx = [REDACTED].
Therefore, x = D/M.
After 3 men drop out, the total number of men becomes M-3.
So, the new contribution of each man would be ([REDACTED]).
The difference between the two contributions would be ([REDACTED]) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
Instructions:
1. Identify the initial contribution of each man.
2. Calculate the total contribution of all M men.
3. Calculate the initial contribution of each man using the formula x = D/M.
4. Calculate the new number of men after 3 men drop out.
5. Calculate the new contribution of each man using the formula ([REDACTED]).
6. Calculate the difference between the two contributions using the formula ([REDACTED]) - (D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)).
7. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
8. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
 - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
 - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
 - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
 - Remember that algebraic manipulation requires careful attention to detail.
