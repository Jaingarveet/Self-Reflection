Explanation:
I correctly set up the equation to solve for x, but I made a calculation error while solving it. 
The gap in my knowledge was not in setting up the equation but in solving it. 
I knew the correct approach but made a calculation error.
Error Keywords:
 - Calculation error
 - Ratio error
 - Algebraic error
Solution:
Let's assume that the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x.
So, the total number of boys in the group is 64 + x and the total number of girls in the group is 40 + x.
We can set up the equation 4/3 = (64 + x)/(40 + x) to solve for x.
Multiplying both sides by 40 + x, we get 4(40 + x) = 3(64 + x).
Simplifying the equation, we get 160 + 4x = 192 + 3x.
Solving for x, we get x = 32.
Adding x to the initial number of boys and girls, we get the total number of members in the group, which is 64 + 40 + 32 + 32 = [REDACTED].
