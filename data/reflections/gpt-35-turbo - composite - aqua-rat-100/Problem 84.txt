Explanation:
I correctly identified that there are only two possible arrangements: Susan-Tim-Zen or Tim-Susan-Zen. However, I did not consider that the chairs are identical, so there is only one way to arrange the children on each of the two possible arrangements. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding of identical objects
 - Misapplication of permutation formula
Solution:
There are only two possible arrangements: Susan-Tim-Zen or Tim-Susan-Zen. Since the chairs are identical, there is only one way to arrange the children on each of the two possible arrangements. Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
Instructions:
[REDACTED]. Identify the number of objects to be arranged.
[REDACTED]. Identify any constraints or conditions on the arrangement.
[REDACTED]. Determine the number of possible arrangements.
4. If the objects being arranged are identical, divide the total number of arrangements by the number of identical objects factorial.
5. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.
[REDACTED]. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
Advice:
 - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
 - Always identify the number of objects to be arranged.
 - Always identify any constraints or conditions on the arrangement.
 - Remember that the number of permutations of n objects is n!.
 - If the objects being arranged are identical, divide the total number of arrangements by the number of identical objects factorial.
