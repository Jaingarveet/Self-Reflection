Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that Passage 1 was arguing that running a household and raising children were rewarding for women. However, the passage only argues that women are better suited for these roles due to their "delicate constitutions, peaceful inclinations, and the many duties of motherhood." Passage 1 does not make any claims about the rewards of these roles for men or women. 
Error Keywords:
 - Assumption error
 - Misinterpretation error
 - Inference error
Solution:
Neither passage suggests that running a household and raising children entail very few activities that are difficult or unpleasant. Therefore, the correct answer is C: "entail very few activities that are difficult or unpleasant."
