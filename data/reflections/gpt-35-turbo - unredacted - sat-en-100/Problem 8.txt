Explanation:
I misread the question and chose the wrong answer. 
The question asks for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder, but I chose the answer for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Careless error
Solution:
The table shows the percentage of colonies with and without colony collapse disorder infected by each pathogen. 
The question asks for the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. 
Looking at the table, we can see that Nosema ceranae infected all four pathogens in colonies with colony collapse disorder, but the percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder infected by Nosema ceranae is 0. 
The highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder infected by a pathogen is 48%, which is the percentage of colonies infected by KBV. 
Therefore, the correct answer is B: KBV.
