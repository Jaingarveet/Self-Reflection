Explanation:
I incorrectly inferred that Usherwood used ibises because they were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration. However, the passage clearly states that the ibises were hand-raised and that data loggers were specially built for the study. The correct answer is D because the passage states that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe. 
Error Keywords:
 - Inference error
 - Misinterpretation
 - Assumption error
Solution:
The study used northern bald ibises to investigate how birds fly in a V formation. The ibises were part of an existing project to reintroduce them to Europe. The study required data loggers and GPS to track the birds' flight positions. The passage states that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
