Explanation:
I misread the table and selected the wrong answer. 
I thought that the table showed the percentage of adenine and guanine in yeast DNA, but it actually showed the percentage of all four types of nitrogenous bases. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Careless mistake
Solution:
The table shows the percentage of all four types of nitrogenous bases in yeast DNA, not just the purines. 
To find the percentage of purines, we need to add the percentage of adenine and guanine. 
The percentage of adenine in yeast DNA is 31.3\%, and the percentage of guanine is 18.7\%. 
Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $18.7 \%$ and $31.3 \%$.
