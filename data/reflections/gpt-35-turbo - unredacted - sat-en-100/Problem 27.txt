Explanation:
I misread the question and chose the wrong answer. 
The authors proposed that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine in DNA. 
The question asked if the data in the table supported the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DNA. 
The correct answer is A because for each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Carelessness
Solution:
The authors proposed that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine in DNA. 
The table shows the percentage of each of the four types of nitrogenous bases in the DNA of various organisms. 
For each given organism, the percentage of adenine is closest to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is closest to the percentage of cytosine. 
Therefore, the data in the table support the authors' proposed pairing of bases in DNA.
