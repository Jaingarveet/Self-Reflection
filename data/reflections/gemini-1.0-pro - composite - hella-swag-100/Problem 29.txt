Explanation:
I failed to consider the context of the previous step and the overall goal of the text. 
While both options [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] provide additional information about using calamine lotion or witch hazel, only option [REDACTED] aligns with the goal of the text, which is to provide instructions on how to get rid of chilblains.
Error Keywords:
 - Contextual error
 - Goal-oriented error
 - Information overload error
Solution:
The text is about how to get rid of chilblains.
The previous step is about using calamine lotion or witch hazel for itching.
The most likely completion is to provide additional information about using calamine lotion or witch hazel.
Option [REDACTED] provides information about how long to let the lotion or witch hazel sit on the skin, which is relevant but not the most important information to include in this step.
Option [REDACTED] provides information about which product to use, which is directly relevant to the goal of the text and helps the reader make an informed decision.
Instructions:
1. Read the entire text carefully to understand the context and goal.
2. Identify the previous step and its purpose.
3. Consider the most likely information that would follow the previous step to achieve the overall goal of the text.
4. Evaluate each option based on its relevance to the previous step and the overall goal.
5. Choose the option that provides the most relevant and useful information.
Advice:
 - Always consider the context of the problem and the overall goal.
 - Do not get sidetracked by irrelevant information.
 - Focus on providing information that is directly relevant to the task at hand.
 - Prioritize information that helps the reader achieve the desired outcome.
 - Be concise and clear in your communication.
