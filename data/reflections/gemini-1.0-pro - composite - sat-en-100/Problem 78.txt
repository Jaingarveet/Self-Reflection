Solution:
The passage describes Lady Carlotta being mistaken for a governess named Miss Hope. 
She does not correct the mistake and goes along with it, even though she has no intention of being a governess. 
The passage focuses on the consequences of this mistaken identity, including Lady Carlotta's interactions with Mrs. Quabarl and her new charges.
