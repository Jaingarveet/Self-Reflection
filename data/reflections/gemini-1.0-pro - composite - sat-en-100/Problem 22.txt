Solution:
The previous question asked about the pairing of bases in DN[REDACTED].
The table shows that the percentage of adenine is always close to the percentage of thymine, and the percentage of guanine is always close to the percentage of cytosine.
In sea urchin DN[REDACTED], the percentage of adenine is $32.8 \%$, and the percentage of thymine is $32.1 \%$.
The percentage of guanine is $17.7 \%$, and the percentage of cytosine is $17.3 \%$.
The closest pairing is between [REDACTED].
