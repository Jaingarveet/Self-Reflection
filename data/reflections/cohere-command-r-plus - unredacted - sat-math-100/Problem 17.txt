Explanation:
I incorrectly assumed that $4b$ in the numerator would cancel out with $a$ in the denominator, resulting in a final value of $\frac{2}{1}$. However, my mistake was in not recognizing that $4b$ should be simplified to $2a$ before proceeding with the calculation. This incorrect assumption led me to choose answer option B.

Error Keywords:
- Algebraic simplification error
- Cancellation error
- Assumption error

Solution: 
Given $\frac{a}{b} = 2$, we can rewrite this as $a = 2b$. Now, we substitute this expression into the fraction:
$\frac{4b}{a} = \frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2a}{a} = \frac{2 \cdot 2b}{2b} = \frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2}{1} = C$

Instructions:
1. Identify the given information: $\frac{a}{b} = 2$.
2. Rewrite $a$ in terms of $b$: $a = 2b$.
3. Substitute this expression into the fraction: $\frac{4b}{2b}$.
4. Simplify the fraction: $\frac{2a}{a}$.
5. Further simplify by substituting $a = 2b$: $\frac{2 \cdot 2b}{2b}$.
6. Calculate the value: $\frac{4b}{2b} = \frac{2}{1}$, which matches choice C.

Advice:
- Always simplify algebraic expressions step-by-step, checking each step for accuracy.
- Be cautious when canceling out factors; ensure you're not eliminating information that should be used in subsequent steps.
- Double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that fractions can be simplified by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator.
