Explanation: I misunderstood the question and applied an incorrect methodology. I incorrectly assumed that we needed to find a factor that, when evaluated at $x = 3$, would give us $-2$. However, the question actually asked for the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. 

Error Keywords:
- Misinterpretation
- Incorrect methodology
- Remainder misunderstanding

Solution: 

Given $p(3) = -2$, we know that when $x = 3$, the polynomial $p(x)$ equals $-2$. 

Now, we need to find the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. 

The remainder theorem states that when a polynomial $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$, the remainder is $p(c)$. 

In this case, $c = 3$, and we know that $p(3) = -2$. 

Therefore, the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$ is $-2$. 

So, the correct answer is: 

D: The remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $x-3$ is -2.

Instructions: 

1. Understand the question: Identify the given information ($p(3) = -2$) and the task (determine the factor or remainder). 
2. Recognize the concept: Identify this problem as one that involves the remainder theorem. 
3. Apply the theorem: Use the remainder theorem, which states that the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - c)$ is equal to $p(c)$. 
4. Plug in the value: Substitute $x = 3$ into the polynomial $p(x)$ to find $p(3)$. 
5. Interpret the result: Recognize that $p(3) = -2$ is the remainder when $p(x)$ is divided by $(x - 3)$. 
6. Choose the correct answer: Select the answer choice that matches this conclusion. 

Advice: 

- Take the time to understand the question and identify the relevant mathematical concepts. 
- Be cautious when interpreting the question, especially when dealing with factors, remainders, and related concepts. 
- Familiarize yourself with theorems and their applications to avoid confusion. 
- Practice similar problems to reinforce your understanding and application of these concepts.
