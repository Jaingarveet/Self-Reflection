Explanation: I made a calculation error in expanding the binomial expression and then incorrectly solved the system of equations. I also failed to consider that the question asked for the two possible values of $c$, not the values of $a$ and $b$.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Algebraic error
- Binomial expansion error
- System of equations error

Solution: We are given the equation:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$

Expanding the left side:
$(a x+2)(b x+7)=abx^2 + 7ax + 2bx + 14$

Comparing coefficients:
$ab = 15$
$7a = c$
$2b = 14 \Rightarrow b = 7$

We are also given $a + b = 8$. Plugging in $b = 7$:
$a + 7 = 8 \Rightarrow a = 1$

Now, we can find the value of $c$ from the equation $7a = c$:
$7a = c \Rightarrow c = 7a$
$c = 7(1) = 7$

So, the two possible values for $c$ are both 7. The correct answer is D: 31 and 41, as these are the only options that yield a value of 7 when added together.

Instructions:
1. Expand the left side of the equation and compare coefficients with the right side.
2. Solve for $a$ and $b$ using the given equation $a + b = 8$.
3. Plug the value of $b$ into the equation $ab = 15$ to find $a$.
4. Calculate the value of $c$ using the equation $7a = c$.
5. Find the two values of $c$ that satisfy the equation when $a$ and $b$ are varied.
6. Ensure your values of $c$ satisfy the original equation.
7. Choose the answer option that matches these values of $c$.

Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and identify exactly what is being asked.
- Double-check your expansion of binomial expressions and coefficient comparisons.
- Solve one variable at a time and substitute known values back into the equations.
- Always validate your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.
- Remember that the question may ask for specific values, not variables.
