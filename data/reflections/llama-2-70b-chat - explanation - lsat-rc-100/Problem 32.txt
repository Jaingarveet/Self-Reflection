Explanation:
The passage states that Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind, and that his musicians performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame. This implies that Ellington composed music that was specifically intended to be performed by the musicians he conducted, which is answer choice [REDACTED].

The passage does not explicitly credit Ellington with inspiring Morrison's style of narration, so answer choice [REDACTED] is not supported. There is no information in the passage about Ellington preventing his musicians from performing lengthy solos, so answer choice [REDACTED] is not supported. Ellington is not mentioned as a character in Morrison's Jazz, so answer choice [REDACTED] is incorrect. There is no information in the passage about Ellington composing music of other genres, so answer choice [REDACTED] is not supported.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
