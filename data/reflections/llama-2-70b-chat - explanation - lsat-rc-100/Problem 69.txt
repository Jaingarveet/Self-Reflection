Explanation:
The passage discusses two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding, with critics arguing that both proposals are unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system. The first proposal is criticized for approaching other cultures from the perspective of the majority culture's values, while the second proposal is criticized for using Western scientific methods to study cultures, which are value-laden and may not be appropriate for understanding non-Western cultures. The main point of the passage is that critics argue that a genuine understanding of cultures requires adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, rather than imposing the values and methods of the majority culture. Therefore, choice [REDACTED] is the best answer.
