Explanation:
The passage discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz and how it uses a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel. It highlights how Morrison's narrative strategy is analogous to Duke Ellington's style of musical composition, where individual characters' voices are given prominence within the overall structure of the narrative, just as a jazz ensemble allows for individual solo performances within the framework of the composer's piece. The passage argues that Morrison's approach redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view and is an original and effective literary analogue of Ellington's musical style. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
