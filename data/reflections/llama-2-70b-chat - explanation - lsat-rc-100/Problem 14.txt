Explanation:
Passage [REDACTED] discusses the issue of [REDACTED] and how they can be nullified by law enforcement agencies declining to prosecute violators. The passage mentions that rules of law are often overinclusive, meaning they forbid some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid. This is because the legislature may not have considered all possible scenarios when creating the law, leading to [REDACTED]. Passage [REDACTED] does not explicitly mention [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED].

Passage [REDACTED] discusses the issue of delinquent water bills in a city and how officials plan to selectively cut off water to high-income residences with outstanding bills. The passage mentions a loophole that prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, which is preventing the city from using a lien to collect overdue water bills. Passage [REDACTED] does not explicitly mention [REDACTED], [REDACTED], or [REDACTED].

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED], [REDACTED], as both passages mention [REDACTED] in the context of laws and their enforcement.
