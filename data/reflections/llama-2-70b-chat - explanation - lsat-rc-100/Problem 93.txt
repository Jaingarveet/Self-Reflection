Explanation:
The passage states that digital publishing will eliminate the need for physical inventory, which includes the cost of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. It also mentions that digital publishing will make it possible to print and bind books on demand at the point of sale, making physical bookstores less necessary. However, it does not mention anything about [REDACTED], which suggests that this activity will still be necessary even with digital publishing.
