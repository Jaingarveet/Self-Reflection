Explanation:
Passage [REDACTED] differs from Passage [REDACTED] in that it is more [REDACTED]. While Passage [REDACTED] accepts the reliability of fingerprint identification, Passage [REDACTED] questions its reliability, highlighting the lack of objective standards for evaluating matches, the variation in local practices, and the unknown error rate. Passage [REDACTED] also cites a more rigorous test that showed a 34% rate of erroneous identification, suggesting that the issue is more complex and nuanced than Passage [REDACTED] acknowledges.

Passage [REDACTED], on the other hand, does not rely on unsubstantiated assumptions. It accepts the reliability of fingerprint identification based on its long-standing use in criminal trials and the fact that experts have long concurred about its reliability, despite the lack of scientific standards or rigorous testing.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].
