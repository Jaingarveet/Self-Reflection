Explanation:
The passage states that the long-standing failure of the Pin Factory model to gain prominence among economists was not a problem of ideology, but rather a problem of mathematical rigor. The author explains that the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns - the Pin Factory - are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the correct answer.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

[REDACTED]: The passage does not state that the only way to achieve increasing returns to scale is through increases in the specialization of workers. In fact, the passage suggests that increasing returns can arise from a variety of sources, including specialization and scale.

[REDACTED]: The passage does not state that economics fails in its quest to be scientific because its models lack mathematical rigor. While the author notes that economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations, the passage does not suggest that this quest is unattainable or that economics is inherently flawed.

[REDACTED]: The passage does not state that under the Pin Factory model, no one is in a position to exert monopoly power. In fact, the passage suggests that the natural tendency of increasing returns is toward monopoly, since a large business can achieve larger scale and lower costs than a small business.

[REDACTED]: The passage does not state that [REDACTED] In fact, the author notes that Smith recognized the tension between the two concepts and struggled to reconcile them.

Therefore, the correct answer is [REDACTED].
