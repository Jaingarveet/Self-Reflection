Explanation:
The author refers to the centuries-old belief that wine has healthful effects in order to suggest that a prevailing scientific assumption - that wine, like other alcoholic beverages, has no active ingredients besides alcohol - might be mistaken. The author presents evidence that moderate wine consumption has healthful effects, which contradicts the assumption that alcohol is the only active ingredient in wine. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
