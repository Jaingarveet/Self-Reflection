Explanation:
The passage explains a theory that neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, and it presents evidence that has helped the theory gain acceptance in the scientific community. It also describes an obstacle to the theory's general acceptance - the difficulty some scientists had imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. The passage then presents an explanation that helps the theory overcome this obstacle, by describing the structure of receptors and how they mediate the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. Finally, the passage discusses a further implication of the theory - the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
