Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the criteria for a work of art to be considered "artistic" according to Dostoyevsky's definition. I thought that any work that effectively conveys the author's thoughts and ideas through artistic expression would be considered artistic. However, Dostoyevsky's definition specifically states that a work of art must express the author's thoughts through characters and events.
