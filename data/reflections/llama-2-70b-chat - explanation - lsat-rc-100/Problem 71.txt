Explanation:
The author of passage [REDACTED] would likely regard choice [REDACTED] as the mistaken assumption underlying arguments like that made in passage [REDACTED]. Passage [REDACTED] explains human behavior in evolutionary terms by showing how it would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. However, passage [REDACTED] argues that this approach needs to be handled with great care and that there may be other interests that explain behavior besides gene propagation. Choice [REDACTED] states that to explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans. This assumption is likely seen as mistaken by the author of passage [REDACTED], who suggests that there may be other factors at play that are not necessarily related to gene propagation.
