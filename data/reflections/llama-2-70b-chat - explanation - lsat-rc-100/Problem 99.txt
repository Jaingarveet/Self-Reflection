Explanation:
The correct answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the process of creating written documents that reflect the collaboration between individuals from different cultures. In the context of the passage, this refers to the written accounts of Native American life histories that were created through the collaboration of non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers. The passage suggests that these accounts were based on oral traditions and artifacts of Native American cultures, but were written down by non-Native American collaborators. Therefore, option [REDACTED] accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase, as it implies that the written works are based on oral communication by members of one culture (Native Americans) but are written down by members of another culture (non-Native Americans).
