Explanation:
The author's attitude toward the scientists discussed in the first paragraph can most accurately be described as [REDACTED]. The author criticizes these scientists for assuming that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, has only one active ingredient, alcohol, and for rarely investigating the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. The author believes that this assumption has led scientists to overlook the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption. The author's tone is critical, suggesting that they believe the scientists have been remiss in their research. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
