Explanation:
The passage provides the most support for the statement that [REDACTED] This is stated in the passage as: "Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed." This implies that Marshall declined to pursue cases with plaintiffs who did not meet these criteria, even if the cases were in keeping with the NAACP's goals.

The other choices are not supported by the passage. There is no mention of Marshall's ideological motivations changing during his tenure on the U.S. Supreme Court (choice A). While the passage notes that some legal scholars have criticized Marshall's tactics as pragmatic attempts to influence judges (choice D), there is no indication that Marshall relied more on expert testimony in lower courts. Choice [REDACTED] is also incorrect, as the passage does not mention any opposition from other members of the NAACP. Finally, choice [REDACTED] is not supported by the passage, which does not discuss how Marshall's colleagues at the NAACP subsequently revised his methods or extended their applications.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED].
