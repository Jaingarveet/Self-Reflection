Explanation:
The author's attitude toward the discovery presented in the last paragraph is best described as optimistic about its potential applications. The author notes that the discovery raises the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders and that pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons, which could potentially help ameliorate a number of debilitating conditions. The author does not express any reservations or concerns about the discovery, and the tone of the passage is generally positive and hopeful. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
