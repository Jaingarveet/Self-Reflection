Explanation:
The best answer is choice [REDACTED]: In recent years, the city has rarely, if ever, turned off the water of customers who were late paying their water bills.

The passage states that officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. This implies that the city has not been vigilant in enforcing water bill payments in the past. The passage does not provide information to support the other choices. Choice [REDACTED] is not necessarily true, as the passage only mentions that 231,000 water customers are late paying their bills, without specifying the proportion of customers this represents. Choice [REDACTED] is also not necessarily true, as the passage does not mention the distribution of overdue water bills across different neighborhoods. Choice [REDACTED] is not supported by the passage, as it does not suggest that it is appropriate to turn off the water of high-income residents who pay their water bills late. Choice [REDACTED] is not a reasonable conclusion, as the passage does not mention anything about enacting a law to classify water bills as taxes.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice [REDACTED].
