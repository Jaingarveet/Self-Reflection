Explanation:
The third paragraph provides examples of how pre-contact Native American cultures expressed personal history through various forms of language, such as songs, chants, stories, and oral autobiography. It also describes how dance, drama, tattoos, shields, and robes were used to convey personal history. These examples support the argument that pre-contact Native Americans had a more inclusive and relational concept of self and identity, which was reflected in their modes of autobiography. Therefore, option [REDACTED] is the best answer.
