Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I focused too much on the specific details provided in the answer choices, rather than considering the overall context and purpose of the text.
The gap in my knowledge was not in common sense or health, but in understanding the intent of the text and choosing the most appropriate completion based on that intent.
I made the assumption that the text was providing a step-by-step guide on how to remove calluses, rather than simply offering a general tip on how to soften the skin to make removal easier.
