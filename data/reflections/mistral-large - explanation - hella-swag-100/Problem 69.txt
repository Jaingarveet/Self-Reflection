Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly because I did not consider the context of the competition and the fact that it was a snatch competition, not just a weightlifting competition.
The gap in my knowledge was not in common sense but in understanding the specific context of the competition.
I knew that shaking hands and saluting is a common way for competitors to show respect and sportsmanship towards each other after they have finished their lift, but I did not consider that this may not be the most likely completion of the text in the context of a snatch competition.
