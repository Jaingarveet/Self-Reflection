In this problem, I made a mistake by misunderstanding the problem and writing an incorrect equation. I incorrectly assumed that the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners, when in fact, the cost of each white sharpeners was 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners. I also made a calculation error when solving for [REDACTED]. To avoid this mistake in the future, I should carefully read the problem and understand the cost of each item, write the equation for the total cost of all items, and solve for the variables carefully.
