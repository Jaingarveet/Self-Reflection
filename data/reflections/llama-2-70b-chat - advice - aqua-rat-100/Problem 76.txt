Advice:
- Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.
- Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.
- Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.
- Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.
- Always double-check your calculations and final answer.
- Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them.

In this case, I made a mistake in my calculation, and I did not double-check my work. I simplified the expression for x too quickly and missed a crucial step. In the future, I should take more time to ensure that my calculations are correct and double-check my work to avoid similar mistakes.
