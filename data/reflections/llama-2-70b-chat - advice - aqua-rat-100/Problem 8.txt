Advice:

* Always write down the correct equation based on the given information.
* Always simplify the equation carefully.
* Always check your calculation to ensure accuracy.
* Always choose the answer that matches your calculated result.

Note:

* In this question, the mistake was in the equation. The bus fare was written as four-thirds the train fare instead of four-thirds the train fare for one person. This led to a mistake in simplifying the equation and ultimately to the wrong answer. Therefore, it is important to be careful when writing down the equation and to double-check it before simplifying it.
