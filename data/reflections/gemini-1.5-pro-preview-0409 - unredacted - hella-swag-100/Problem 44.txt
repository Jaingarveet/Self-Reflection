## Reflection on Incorrect Answer
**Explanation:** My reasoning was flawed because I focused on the general idea of preparing a bottle without considering the specific context of a gravity bong. Option A, while related to bottle preparation, doesn't directly address the size issue introduced in the prompt.
**Error Keywords:**
*   Contextual Misinterpretation 
*   Ignoring Specific Clues
*   Focusing on General Concepts
## Step-by-Step Solution
1.  **Analyze the Prompt:** The text discusses choosing a bottle size for a gravity bong, implying the next step would involve size considerations.
2.  **Evaluate Options:**
    *   Option A discusses cleaning and sealing, which is not directly related to size.
    *   Option B talks about cutting and feeding plastic, unrelated to the current context.
    *   Option C directly addresses the size issue by suggesting appropriate bottle sizes for individual or group use.
    *   Option D introduces irrelevant information about rubber gloves and snapping plastic.
3.  **Choose the Best Option:** Option C logically follows the prompt by providing size recommendations based on the number of users.
