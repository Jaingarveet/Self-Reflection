Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which is only supported by Passage [REDACTED]. Passage [REDACTED] argues that there are no objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study. The passage suggests that fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable. This principle underlies the arguments in both passages. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misunderstanding
 - Passage-specific
 - Failure to integrate information
Solution:
The principle that underlies the arguments in both passages is that fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable. 
Instructions:
1. Read the passages carefully and identify the main arguments.
2. Look for common themes or principles that underlie the arguments in both passages.
3. Eliminate answer choices that are only supported by one passage.
4. Choose the answer choice that is supported by both passages.
Advice:
 - Read the passages carefully and identify the main arguments.
 - Look for common themes or principles that underlie the arguments in both passages.
 - Eliminate answer choices that are only supported by one passage.
 - Choose the answer choice that is supported by both passages.
 - Be careful not to misinterpret or misunderstand the information presented in the passages.
