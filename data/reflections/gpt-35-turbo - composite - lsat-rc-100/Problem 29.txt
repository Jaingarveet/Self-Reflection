Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments during the 1930s. However, the passage does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The correct answer is [REDACTED], which states that the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances. The passage mentions that precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. This indicates that the physics community was aware of the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation
 - Unsupported claim
 - Lack of evidence
