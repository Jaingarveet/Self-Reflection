Explanation:
I incorrectly chose answer choice [REDACTED], which discusses African American novelists basing their work on the structure of blues music. This answer choice is not relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16, which is about the uniqueness of Toni Morrison's approach in using the structure of jazz music in her novel Jazz. 
The correct answer is [REDACTED], which states that depending on whether or not a novel is read aloud, it can be found to be somewhat musical in nature. This answer choice is relevant because it suggests that the musicality of a novel is subjective and can depend on the reader's interpretation. The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Toni Morrison's use of the structure of jazz music in her novel Jazz is unique and redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view.
