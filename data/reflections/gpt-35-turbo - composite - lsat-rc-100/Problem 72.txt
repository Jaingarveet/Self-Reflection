Explanation:
I incorrectly answered that moderate wine consumption appears to decrease the thickness of the interior walls of blood vessels. However, the passage does not suggest this. The correct answer is [REDACTED], which is that the passage suggests all of the following except that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. The passage does suggest that high lipid levels are dangerous, but it does not suggest that they lead to increased endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness. 
Error Keywords:
 - Misreading
 - Misinterpretation
 - Inference error
 - Incorrect answer choice
Solution:
The passage suggests that moderate wine consumption appears to have ameliorating effects on endothelial cell reactivity and platelet adhesiveness, which are linked to the development of premature heart disease. The passage also suggests that high lipid levels are dangerous because they lead to premature heart disease. However, the passage does not suggest that moderate wine consumption decreases the thickness of the interior walls of blood vessels.
