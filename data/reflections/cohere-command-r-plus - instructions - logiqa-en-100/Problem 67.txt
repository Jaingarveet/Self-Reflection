Instructions:
1. Identify the argument's conclusion: to understand the true face of the emperor, one must read Ye Shi.
2. Determine the gap in information: why is Ye Shi necessary if the official history is the emperor's diary?
3. Analyze the options: which choice fills this gap and provides the missing link?
4. Evaluate each choice: does it provide a valid reason for the argument's conclusion?
5. Double-check your interpretation: does the chosen assumption align with the argument's logic?
