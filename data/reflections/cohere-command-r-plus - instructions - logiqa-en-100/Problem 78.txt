Instructions:
1. Identify the four distinct roles Mr. Chen's guests fill: 
    - Father's brother-in-law
    - Brother-in-law's father
    - Brother's mother-in-law
    - Brother-in-law's brother
2. Understand that these roles are not mutually exclusive, and each role can be filled by a different person. 
3. Realize that the brother-in-law's brother is not necessarily the same person as the brother's mother-in-law's husband, as they can be brothers married to different people. 
4. Count the number of guests invited (four) and select the answer choice reflecting that count.
