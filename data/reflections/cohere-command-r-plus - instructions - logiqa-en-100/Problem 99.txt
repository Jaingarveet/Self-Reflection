Instructions:
1. Focus on the specific argument to be refuted: the belief that "humans may usher in the era of 'customized babies'."
2. Examine each choice for its effectiveness in refuting this belief.
3. Consider the context and the distinction between gene screening and "customized babies."
4. Identify the choice that clarifies this distinction and refutes the belief effectively.

Step-by-step solution:
1. The context mentions "the world's first test-tube baby screened by next-generation gene sequencing technology." This refers to gene screening, which aims to avoid reproductive defects and create opportunities for human eugenics.
2. Choice [REDACTED] clarifies that gene screening has a specific purpose and scope, distinct from the concept of "customized babies." It refutes the belief by explaining that "customized babies" involve cloning, a separate and more complex ethical issue.
3. Therefore, Choice [REDACTED] is the best option to refute the views of ordinary people who believe that "customized babies" are imminent.
