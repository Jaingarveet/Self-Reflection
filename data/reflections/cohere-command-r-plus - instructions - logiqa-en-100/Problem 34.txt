Instructions:
1. Understand the original statement: "Do not do what you don't want to be done to others."
2. Identify the key idea: avoiding imposing unwanted actions on others.
3. Analyze each choice for logical connections to the original statement:

[REDACTED]. This choice suggests that only those who do as they please can impose their actions on others. This is not an accurate inference as the original statement does not specify a causal relationship.

[REDACTED]. Choice [REDACTED] introduces the idea of "giving it to others," which is not implied by the original statement. It shifts the focus to providing something desirable, rather than avoiding unwanted actions.

[REDACTED]. This choice is a direct application of the original statement, changing the structure to a positive form. It captures the core idea of the original statement.

[REDACTED]. This choice reflects a misinterpretation. The original statement is about avoiding unwanted actions, not about ensuring that all actions are desired by others.

4. Recognize that Choice [REDACTED] introduces a new, unrelated concept and, therefore, is not a logical inference.
