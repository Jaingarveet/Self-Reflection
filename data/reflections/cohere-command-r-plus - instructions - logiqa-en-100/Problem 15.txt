Instructions:
1. Identify the type of argument presented (deductive, inductive, or abductive).
2. Recognize that the argument is not purely deductive, as it involves probabilistic reasoning.
3. Understand that the truth of the premises increases the likelihood of the conclusion being true but does not guarantee it.
4. Consider alternative scenarios or conditions that could affect the conclusion.
5. Choose the answer that reflects the probabilistic nature of the argument.
