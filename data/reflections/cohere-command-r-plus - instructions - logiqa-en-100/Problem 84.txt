Instructions:
1. Identify the structure of the original argument:
   - Premise 1: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED].
   - Premise 2: [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED].
   - Conclusion: Therefore, [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED].
2. Analyze each choice:
   - Look for the same logical structure: All [REDACTED] are [REDACTED]; [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED]; therefore, [REDACTED] is not [REDACTED].
   - Choice [REDACTED] is about respect and kindness, which do not match the structure.
   - Choice [REDACTED] is about cheap vegetables, but it does not follow the [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED] structure.
   - Choice [REDACTED] is about employees and English speaking abilities, but it does not follow the argument form.
   - Choice [REDACTED] follows the structure: Anyone who meets conditions (A) can apply for a loan (B). Sun Wen (C) didn't, so they lack conditions (not A).
3. Choose the answer that matches the structure.
