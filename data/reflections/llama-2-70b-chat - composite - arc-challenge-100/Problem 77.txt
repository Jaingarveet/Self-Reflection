Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between the sheep's traits and their ability to survive and breed. I thought that the larger and stronger sheep with dark wool would have an advantage in the presence of a new predator, but in reality, the opposite is true. The sheep with light wool, which are smaller and weaker, will be better able to escape the predator and survive, leading to an increase in their population.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of the relationship between traits and survival
* Incorrect assumption about the effect of a new predator
* Failure to consider the advantage of smaller size in escaping predators

Solution:
The correct answer is [REDACTED], [REDACTED]. The introduction of a new predator will put pressure on the sheep population, and the smaller and weaker sheep with light wool will be more vulnerable to predation. As a result, their population will decrease.

Instructions:

1. Identify the relationship between the traits of the sheep and their ability to survive and breed.
2. Consider the effect of a new predator on the sheep population.
3. Evaluate the advantage of smaller size in escaping predators.
4. Choose the answer that reflects the likely change in the sheep population.

Advice:

* Always consider the specific traits of the species and their environment when evaluating evolutionary pressures.
* Think carefully about the effects of introducing a new predator on the population dynamics.
* Remember that smaller size can be an advantage in escaping predators.
* Always evaluate the answer choices carefully and consider the likely outcome based on the information provided.
