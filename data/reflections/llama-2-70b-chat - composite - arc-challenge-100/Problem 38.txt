Explanation:
I incorrectly answered the question because I misunderstood the relationship between density and mass. I thought that the higher density of red-clay bricks meant that a given volume of bricks would have a higher mass than the same volume of air. However, the density of an object is actually a measure of its mass per unit volume, so the mass of an object is directly proportional to its density and volume. Therefore, the mass of a given volume of bricks will be higher than the mass of the same volume of air.

Error Keywords:

* Misunderstanding of density and mass relationship
* Incorrect application of density to mass

Solution:
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. The density of red-clay bricks is 2000 kg/m^3.
2. The density of air is 1 kg/m^3.
3. The volume of [REDACTED] is 2 cubic meters.
4. The mass of [REDACTED] is 2 x 2000 = 4000 kg.
5. The volume of [REDACTED] is 6000 cubic meters.
6. The mass of [REDACTED] is 6000 x 1 = 6000 kg.
7. Comparing the masses, we see that 4000 kg is less than 6000 kg.
8. Therefore, the answer is [REDACTED]: [REDACTED].

Instructions:

1. Identify the density of the objects in question.
2. Identify the volume of the objects in question.
3. Calculate the mass of the objects by multiplying their density and volume.
4. Compare the masses to determine the correct answer.

Advice:

* Always carefully read and understand the question.
* Make sure you understand the relationship between density and mass.
* Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.
* Compare the masses of the objects to determine the correct answer.
* Remember that density is a measure of mass per unit volume, so the mass of an object is directly proportional to its density and volume.
