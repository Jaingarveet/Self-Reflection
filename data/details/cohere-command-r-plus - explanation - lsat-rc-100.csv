Choice A is incorrect because it is possible to understand the social and historical circumstances of a different culture, but this requires moving beyond the methods and perspectives of one's own culture.

Choice B is correct. The critics would agree that historical and social circumstances play a role in a culture's values, and that these can differ between cultures. Therefore, trying to understand another culture through the lens of one's own can lead to distortion.

Choice C is incorrect because it is not specifically mentioned in the passage. While it may be true that understanding another culture from multiple perspectives is beneficial, the critics' main argument is that the methods and perspectives of the majority culture are insufficient and can be biased.

Choice D is incorrect because it contradicts the idea of multicultural understanding. Understanding between cultures with different values is possible, but it requires an approach that respects and adopts the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied.

Choice E is incorrect because it focuses specifically on the values of liberalism, while the critics are discussing a broader issue of understanding all cultures through their own perspectives and methods, not just those with liberal values.

","Thought: The author of Passage A discusses the issue of overinclusive rules and how they can be mitigated through discretionary non-enforcement by law enforcement agencies. They argue that while rules of law are often overinclusive, resulting in the unintended prohibition of certain conduct, allowing discretion can reduce the social costs without creating loopholes (underinclusion).

In the plan described in Passage B, officials intend to selectively cut the water of high-income residents who are late in paying their water bills to make an example and encourage timely payments. However, a loophole exists where the city is prohibited from placing liens on properties for debts other than taxes, and water charges are technically not taxes.

The author of Passage A would likely agree with statement E. They emphasize the role of law enforcement agencies in mitigating the issues arising from overinclusive rules and the need for discretionary non-enforcement to reduce social costs. Statement E suggests introducing specific laws related to water bill payments to provide clearer guidelines and effective incentives, aligning with the author's argument.

Choice A is incorrect because it weakens the second proposal by suggesting that only members of a culture can truly understand it, which is not a practical approach for multicultural education.

Choice B is irrelevant as it does not address the specific criticism about the inherent subjectivity of Western scientific methods.

Choice C is incorrect as it reinforces the idea that non-Western societies recognize the influence of their own values when interpreting other cultures, implying that a neutral stance is indeed challenging to achieve.
