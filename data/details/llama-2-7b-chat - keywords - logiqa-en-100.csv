To support this view, the best choice would be:

B: After a slight electric shock to the brain, the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations.

Explanation:
The passage states that the researchers used a technique called transcranial random noise stimulation to lightly shock the areas of the brains of 25 test group members. This suggests that the shocks were not invasive and did not cause significant pain to the subjects. Therefore, option A is not the best choice.

Option B is the best choice because it explains how the micro-shocks in the brain could improve the brain's computing power. The passage states that the blood flow between the neurons in the brain is significantly enhanced after the shocks, but it returns to normal after multiple stimulations. This suggests that the enhancement in blood flow may have a lasting effect on the brain's computing power.

Question: Can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?

Reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that I had made a mistake in my reasoning. Here is my self-reflection:

Error Keywords:

* Inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge
* Large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River being taken by road or railway

Reasoning:
The expert's point of view is based on the assumption that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the only obstruction in the Yangtze River waterway. However, this is not the case. There are other bridges along the Yangtze River with similar clear height restrictions, including the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing, and other places, which also have a clear height of 24 meters.

Therefore, even if the Nanjing Bridge were to be demolished and rebuilt, it would not completely dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River. The issue of large ships being unable to pass through the Yangtze River Bridge is not limited to the Nanjing Bridge alone.

Conclusion:
The expert's point of view is not entirely accurate, and there are other factors to consider when addressing the issue of large ships passing through the Yangtze River waterway. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

I previously answered this question incorrectly. My reasoning was as follows:

The correct answer is (B) Li Si's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's.

Question: Which of the following reasoning clearly shows that the above argument is not valid?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and after reflecting on my solution and the correct answer, I realized that I made a mistake. Here is my self-reflection:

I mistakenly chose option A, which is not a valid argument to refute the given argument. The argument being made is that all people under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China are Chinese, and Taiwanese are not under the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, therefore Taiwanese are not Chinese.

To refute this argument, we need to provide a logical reasoning that shows that the premise is false or that the conclusion does not follow from the premise.

Option B is not a valid argument, as it does not address the premise of the argument being made.

Option C is also not a valid argument, as it does not provide any logical reasoning to refute the argument.

Option D is a valid argument, as it provides a logical reasoning to refute the argument being made. By pointing out that not all criminal behaviors are illegal behaviors, and that violations should not be condemned by society, we can show that the argument being made is false.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.

Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above argument?

Self-reflection:
After initially answering the question incorrectly, I reflected on the problem and my solution. I realized that I had misunderstood the argument and the information provided. Here is my revised answer:

The best choice to support the argument is (B): During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%. At that time, there were many giant insects on the earth, and the wingspan of the dragonfly was close to one meter.

This choice is the best fit because it provides evidence that high oxygen levels can support larger insects. The argument states that the amount of oxygen content can determine the size of insects, and the example from the Carboniferous period provides a historical precedent for this claim. The fact that there were many giant insects during this time period when oxygen levels were higher supports the argument that higher oxygen levels can lead to larger insects.

The conditions given in the problem are:

1. E or F has one person to participate, but not both.
2. One of J or K will participate, but not both.
3. If J participates, then G participates.
4. Unless F participates, M does not participate.

From condition 2, we can conclude that one of J or K will participate, but not both.
From condition 3, we can conclude that if J participates, then G will participate.
From condition 4, we can conclude that unless F participates, M will not participate.

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations of players:

1. E participates: In this case, F cannot participate, and G must participate. So, the answer is (B) E and M.
2. F participates: In this case, J cannot participate, and K must participate. So, the answer is (D) G and K.
3. Both E and F participate: This is impossible, as condition 1 states that only one of E or F can participate.
4. Both J and K participate: This is also impossible, as condition 2 states that only one of J or K will participate.

Question: Which of the following is most similar to the above argument?

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand why. The argument is based on the premise that Li Wenbing's family cannot see the landscape, which means they are not a landscape room. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Anyone who meets the basic conditions can apply for a small loan. Sun Wen did not apply for a small loan, so she did not meet the basic conditions.

Here's my original answer and the reasoning behind it:

Original answer: (C) Employees of Jiutian Company can speak English, Lin Yingrui is an employee of Jiutian Company, therefore, Lin Yingrui can speak English.

Reasoning: The argument states that Li Wenbing's family is not a landscape room, which means they are not a type of room that can see the landscape. Therefore, the conclusion that Lin Yingrui can speak English because she is an employee of Jiutian Company is incorrect. However, I realize now that the argument is not about the ability to speak English, but rather the ability to meet the basic conditions for a small loan.

","  Thought:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand the mistake. Let me reevaluate the problem and find the correct solution.

The conditions given in the problem are:

1. If G or H is arranged to play, they must be in the front.
2. If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.
3. If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.
4. Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.
5. P cannot be in the same team as Q.
6. If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.

From the given choices, the only acceptable arrangement for Team 1 is:

C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G

Explanation:

* H is in Team 2, so Q must be in the middle of Team 1.
* G must be in the front, as per condition 1.
* L must be in the middle, as per condition 2.
* Q must be in the back, as per condition 3.
* Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N, so P cannot be in Team 1.
* P cannot be in the same team as Q, so Q must be in the middle of Team 1.

Therefore, the only acceptable arrangement for Team 1 is: Before? L Middle? Q After? G.",,,A,0,621,325,946,
