Given that Image's website target is 2 days, and considering the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, Image's voicemail target can be either 2 days or 1 day.

The conditions state that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, meaning there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf. However, this does not mean that there cannot be two books on the bottom shelf if there is only one book on the top shelf. Therefore, options A and B should not be eliminated based on this condition.
The conditions also state that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option C can be eliminated. 
The conditions also state that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, option D can be eliminated. 
This leaves options A, B, and E as possible answers. However, option E can be eliminated because it includes four books, and there are only three shelves, with at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.

Given the conditions, the first batch of sugar cookies could be made on Monday. This does not conflict with any of the conditions. The condition that ""No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day"" does not prevent the first batch of sugar cookies from being made on Monday.

","Thought: 
The conditions state that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means that a 3-day website target can only be set for a client if its voicemail target is also 3 days. However, since there are only three possible targets (1 day, 2 days, and 3 days), a 3-day voicemail target would mean that the website target would also have to be 3 days. Therefore, a 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one client.

","Thought: 
Given that the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy cannot be in space 6 because it must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. However, since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, and one restaurant must be at the end of the row, a restaurant must be in space 7. This means the pharmacy must be in space 1. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4 to maintain the required separation.
