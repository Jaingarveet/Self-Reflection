I previously answered this question incorrectly, stating that the branch of the internal carotid artery that is not a branch of the cavernous part is the Ophthalmic artery. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is the Inferior hypophyseal artery.

The cavernous part of the internal carotid artery gives rise to several branches, including the anterior cerebral artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the posterior cerebral artery. These branches supply blood to different regions of the brain. The cavernous branch, on the other hand, is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies blood to the cavernous sinus, a structure located in the sinus cavity of the brain.

In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint.Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals.Treatment:Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base.

I mistakenly selected option D, Ergotamine, as a drug commonly used in PPH. However, upon further review, I realized that Ergotamine is not commonly used in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) management. Ergotamine is actually a medication used to treat migraines and other vascular headaches, and it has no role in PPH management.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, Oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in PPH management, as it helps to stimulate uterine contractions to control bleeding after childbirth. Mifepristone, Misoprostol, and Ergotamine are not commonly used in PPH management.

I hope this reflection helps me to accurately answer this question in the future.","Atonicity is the most common cause of PPH. Any drug which increases the tone of uterus or the force of contraction is used to control PPH and is called oxytocic.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4.

Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions.

The correct reason for preferring time sector scanning of neonates is ""Better resolution."" Neonates have small skulls and brain structures, which makes it difficult to obtain high-quality images using traditional scanning techniques. Time sector scanning, on the other hand, allows for higher resolution images to be obtained, which is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment of neonatal conditions.

Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

Question: Which of the following is NOT a branch of intracranial part of Internal carotid artery(103 - BDC- 3) 4th edition
Choices:

Action: Reflecting on my previous answer and the correct answer, I realize that I made a mistake in identifying the branch of the internal carotid artery.

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered that the Middle cerebral artery is a branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery. However, upon reviewing the correct answer, I see that the Middle cerebral artery is actually a branch of the posterior communicating artery, not the internal carotid artery.

Correct Answer: The branch of the intracranial part of the internal carotid artery that is NOT a branch is the Posterior communicating artery.

  A: Timolol

","  Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and I understand now that I misunderstood the effect of drugs on the trabecular meshwork. I confused the functions of different drugs, including Timolol, Pilocarpine, Brimonidine, and Brinzolamide.

To answer this question correctly, I will break down the information provided:

* Trabecular meshwork: This refers to the network of collagen fibers in the trabecular tissue of the eye.
* Aqueous outflow: This refers to the flow of aqueous humor from the eye through the trabecular meshwork and into the canal of Schlemm.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

* A: Timolol is a beta-blocker that reduces aqueous production in the eye. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork directly.
* B: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agent that increases aqueous production in the eye. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork directly.
* C: Brimonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist that reduces aqueous production in the eye. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork directly.
* D: Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces aqueous production in the eye. It does not affect the trabecular meshwork directly.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Pilocarpine, as it increases aqueous production in the eye but does not affect the trabecular meshwork directly.

In conclusion, I made a mistake in my previous answer due to confusion regarding the functions of different drugs and their effects on the trabecular meshwork. I hope this reflection and analysis help me answer the question correctly this time.",Refer katzung 12e p161 KDT 6/e p 145 Miotics like pilocarpine act by increasing the trabecular outflow Drugs for glaucoma -mechanism of action Brimonidine- reducing access production increasing uveoscleral outflow lantonoprost- increase the uveoscleral outflow pilocarpine - increases trabecular outflow Betaxolo- reduces aqueous secretion by ciliary body,,B,0,435,412,847,

Reflection:
I reflected on my previous answer and realized that I overlooked the importance of the patient's elevated AFP and hCG levels. These findings are highly suggestive of a germ cell tumor, which is a type of tumor that originates in the gonads. The location of the mass at the left renal hilum is also consistent with this diagnosis. I should have given more weight to these findings in my initial answer.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, and upon reflection, I realized that I misunderstood the context of the question. The correct answer is (B) Whipple's procedure.

Whipple's procedure is a surgical procedure used to treat pancreatic cancer that has spread to the stomach. It involves removing the tumor, as well as the affected part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct. The 'Liver shrinkage diet' is recommended before this procedure to reduce the size of the liver and make the surgery easier.
