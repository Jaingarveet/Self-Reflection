Reflection:
In my previous answer, I chose option A, but upon reflection, I realize that option C is the better choice. The passage suggests that proponents of the second version of multicultural education argue that scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would likely be considered objectionable by proponents of this version of multicultural education.

In contrast, option A, a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies, might be considered acceptable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education, as it does not necessarily involve the imposition of Western scientific methods onto non-Western cultures.

The author of passage B calls evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"" because it suggests that human behavior is driven by an unacknowledged interest in propagating genes. In passage A, the author explains that evolutionary psychology seeks to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution, and that altruism presents a difficult problem for this field. The author then suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother's instinct to help her injured child.

This explanation implies that the mother's behavior is not solely motivated by her own interests or desires, but is also influenced by an unconscious drive to promote the survival and replication of her genes. This is what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"" - it suggests that human behavior is secretly driven by an interest in propagating genes, even though the individual may not be aware of or acknowledge this interest.

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question because I misunderstood the relationship between increased size and monopoly power. I thought that the key factor was the ability of larger businesses to exert monopoly power, rather than the natural tendency towards monopoly that arises from increasing returns to scale.

Upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This answer choice undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that not all industries will naturally tend towards monopoly. Instead, some industries may have a smaller minimum efficient scale, meaning that smaller businesses can still achieve economies of scale and compete effectively with larger firms. This reduces the likelihood of monopoly power and suggests that increased size alone is not sufficient to guarantee dominance in a market.

The passage elaborates on Dostoyevsky's position, explaining that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real and that artistry is the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After re-reading the passage and reflecting on my previous answer, I realize that my mistake was due to a lack of careful reading and understanding of the author's main point.

The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view by simulating the style of a genius of music, Duke Ellington, while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity. The author argues that Morrison's use of multiple narrative voices and perspectives creates a sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, similar to how Ellington's compositions intertwine ensemble sound with individual solo performances.

Therefore, the best answer to the question would be choice A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. This choice is supported by the passage, which states that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, analogous to the way in which Ellington's compositions intertwine ensemble sound with individual solo performances.

The other choices do not directly challenge the author's assertion. Choice B mentions that some African American novelists sought to base their work on the structure of blues music, but this does not contradict the author's claim about Morrison's unique approach in Jazz. Choice C states that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question, but this is not directly related to the author's assertion about Morrison's use of jazz in Jazz. Choice D mentions that any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature, depending on whether or not it is read aloud, but this does not challenge the author's specific claim about Morrison's use of jazz in Jazz. Choice E states that a smaller number of African American writers than non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music, but this does not directly relate to the author's assertion about Morrison's unique approach in Jazz.

The passage suggests that secondary substances in plants are the result of genetic mutations and have evolved to provide defense mechanisms against insects. These substances can be harmful to insects, warning them of the presence of other harmful substances, or they can be characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade insects from feeding. The passage also states that insects have evolved ways to circumvent these defenses, such as detoxifying harmful substances or avoiding their effects.

In passage A, the author suggests that law enforcement agencies have the power to exercise discretionary nonenforcement to reduce the costs of overinclusive laws without increasing underinclusion.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.

The author mentions ""crimes of passion"" in line 3 to provide a contrast that helps to define a deliberate crime. The author is not giving an example of a kind of deliberate crime (choice A), nor are they demonstrating that not all crimes can be deterred (choice C). The mention of ""crimes of passion"" does not directly help illustrate one side of the current debate in the legal community (choice D), although it does provide a contrast that helps to define a deliberate crime. The author is also not mentioning a crime that is a product of the influence of societal norms (choice E).

The physics community during the 1930s neglected earlier theoretical developments indicating that atoms could be split.
This answer choice aligns with the passage's information, stating that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms, despite some theoretical physicists producing calculations indicating it was possible.

Let's review the other answer choices:

B: It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
This choice is incorrect, as the passage states that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms, implying they did not reevaluate the calculations.

C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
This choice is incorrect, as the passage states that Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and Hahn identified one of the substances as barium.

D: It showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split.
This choice is incorrect, as the passage does not mention anything about the ease of splitting uranium atoms.

E: It recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.

After re-reading the passages and the question, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the term ""capricious enforcement."" I thought it referred to the arbitrary or random application of the law, but it actually refers to the selective enforcement of the law based on the legislature's intent.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws. This answer choice aligns with the idea of discretionary nonenforcement, which allows law enforcement agencies to selectively enforce the law based on the legislature's intended purpose, rather than strictly following the letter of the law.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. Upon reflection, I realize that I misunderstood the question and focused on the wrong aspect of the passage.

The correct answer is A: Most water customers in the city are late paying their water bills.

This answer can be inferred from the statement in passage B that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills, which is a significant portion of the total number of water customers in the city.

My previous answer, E: The only reasonable solution to the problem of overdue water bills in the city is to enact a law that classifies water bills as taxes, is not supported by the passage. While the passage mentions that a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, it does not suggest that enacting a law to classify water bills as taxes is the only reasonable solution to the problem.

","  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my refection on the problem and my previous answer:

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as ""literature"" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing has aspired to the condition of music, in which form contributes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set off by quotation marks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as if with quotation marks around their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from performing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he conducted.
  E: Though he composed and conducted primarily jazz, he also composed some music of other genres.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A. However, upon reflection, I realize that the passage does not explicitly state that Morrison credited Ellington with inspiring her style of narration. Instead, the passage highlights the similarity between Ellington's compositional style and Morrison's literary style, suggesting that Morrison may have drawn inspiration from Ellington's music. Therefore, the correct answer is D, He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he conducted. This answer choice is supported by the passage's description of Ellington's compositional style, which involved constructing his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind.

Advice:
When answering questions, it's important to carefully consider the information provided in the passage and avoid making assumptions or inferences that are not supported by the text. In this case, I incorrectly assumed that Morrison had explicitly credited Ellington with inspiring her style of narration, when in fact, the passage only suggests a similarity between their styles.

Passage A states that ""fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate,"" while Passage B argues that ""the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study"" and that ""a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.""

Therefore, the correct answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case. The authors have different views on the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification, with Passage A presenting a more optimistic view and Passage B highlighting the limitations and uncertainties of the method.

In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaboratorsâ€”that emerged from ""bicultural composite authorship."" Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiographyâ€” that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

The correct answer is C: The demands of literary agents will be the impetus for completing the transition to the new digital model. The author argues that literary agents will demand a larger share of revenue for their authors under the digital publishing model, which will put pressure on traditional publishers to adapt and offer higher royalty payments to authors.

Here's my reflection on the problem:

The passage states that the Pin Factory model has long been ignored in economic thought because it is difficult to represent mathematically. This suggests that the model is not easily captured by formalism, which may have contributed to its lack of prominence.

The passage also notes that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which contradicts the idea of the Invisible Hand. This implies that there is a tension between the Pin Factory model and the Invisible Hand model.

Finally, the passage states that economists have sought to bring the Pin Factory model into the mainstream of economic thought, but have failed repeatedly due to the lack of mathematical rigor in their ideas.

Based on this information, the correct answer is:

C: The Pin Factory model's long-standing failure to gain prominence among economists was not a problem of ideology.

The passage states that the failure was due to the lack of mathematical rigor in the ideas of economists, rather than any ideological objections to the model. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

The relationship between these two sentences is best described as B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines. The author is presenting a counterargument to the opinion of the legal scholars, stating that defense lawyers should not blindly provide the best defense possible without considering the facts of the case and their own beliefs about their client's guilt or innocence.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realize that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is (E) A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. However, the worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. The worker's action is motivated by a desire to seek revenge and justice, rather than a careful calculation of the expected utility of the action. The worker is not weighing the potential costs and benefits of the action, but rather acting on an emotional impulse. Therefore, option (E) is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

In contrast, options (A), (B), (C), and (D) all involve a calculation of the expected utility of the action, weighing the potential costs and benefits. For example, the waiter in option (A) is making a rational calculation to conceal his tip income to reduce his taxes, as he believes that the likelihood of detection is low and the potential cost of being caught is outweighed by the benefit of paying less tax. Similarly, the motorist in option (B) is avoiding speeding because she knows that the cost of a speeding ticket outweighs the benefit of speeding. The industrialist in option (C) is illegally discharging a pollutant because the cost of treatment exceeds the fine for illegally discharging it, which is a rational calculation of the expected utility of the action. The government official in option (D) is risking prosecution for soliciting bribes because the potential benefit of financial gain outweighs the potential cost of prosecution.

","  Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though ""by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."" For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scaleâ€”the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this ""underground river"" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.

Answer: 
The correct answer is B: illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor.

Explanation:
The reference to railroads in the passage serves to illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor. The passage states that railroads are an example of a business that has characteristics of the Pin Factory, such as increasing returns to scale. However, the passage also states that the economics of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically, which made it difficult for economists to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the reference to railroads serves to illustrate the challenge of mathematically modeling the Pin Factory concept, which is the central idea of the passage.

Self-Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the context of the passage. I thought the reference to railroads was meant to illustrate the shortcomings of economists' emphasis on the Invisible Hand, which led me to choose answer D. However, upon re-reading the passage, I realized that the reference to railroads was actually meant to illustrate the difficulty of stating the concept of the Pin Factory with mathematical rigor, which led me to choose answer B. This mistake taught me the importance of carefully reading the passage and understanding the context in which the reference is made.",,,D,0,1144,1169,2313,

I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the relationship between plants and insects. I thought that the diversity of secondary substances in plants was directly proportional to the number of insects with which they had interacted. However, the passage states that the diversity of secondary substances is not necessarily related to the number of insects, but rather to the evolutionary competition between plants and insects.

The correct answer is D: No particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.

The passage states that secondary substances in plants are not directly created in response to insects, but rather they are the result of genetic mutations. However, insects have played a role in the evolution of these substances because they have influenced which substances are conserved and passed on to subsequent generations. Insects have also evolved ways to circumvent plants' chemical defenses, but they have not developed outright immunity to plants' secondary substances.

The author's discussion in the first paragraph proceeds in which one of the following ways?

The correct answer is (B): from a general remark about two art forms, to a similar observation about a particular artistic tradition, to a specific comment about a particular work that exemplifies the prior remarks.

The author starts by discussing the relationship between music and literature, highlighting their similarities and differences. Then, they focus on the African American tradition, where music is considered one of the greatest artistic achievements. Finally, they introduce Toni Morrison's novel Jazz as an example of how music has influenced literature, specifically in its structure and narrative style.

Therefore, option (B) best describes the author's approach, as they move from a general discussion of two art forms to a specific observation about a particular artistic tradition and then to a specific work that illustrates that observation.

Previous answer: B

Reason: I misunderstood the main point of the passage and thought it was about the importance of recognizing the subjective, intuitive, and mystical in multicultural education.

Correct answer: E

Reason: The passage argues that the first two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding are flawed because they either judge non-Western cultures using Western values (proposal 1) or use Western methods to study non-Western cultures (proposal 2). The passage suggests that a genuine understanding of cultures with different value systems requires adopting their perspectives and methods.

My previous answer was choice C: To explain a type of human behavior in evolutionary terms, it is sufficient to show that the behavior would have improved the reproductive success of early humans.

However, upon reevaluating, I realize that my previous answer was incorrect. The author of passage B does not explicitly mention or challenge the assumption in choice C.

The correct answer is choice B: Any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation.

The author of passage B implies that this assumption is mistaken when stating that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory that imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not even aware of. The author suggests that interests other than the propagation of genes can explain behavior and that it is not necessarily the case that early humans acted solely to promote the self-propagation of their genes.

Reflection:
Previous answer: B

Self-reflection:
I mistakenly chose option B, which asks about the similarity of Jazz to other works by Morrison, thinking it was the best fit. However, upon re-reading the passage, it's clear that option E is the better choice. The passage discusses how Morrison's use of narrative style in Jazz is similar to the way Duke Ellington constructed his compositions, and how it redefines the possibilities of narrative point of view. Therefore, option E, which asks about a characteristic of Jazz that is also present in the work of some other African American writers, is the best answer choice.

Advice:
Always read the passage carefully and understand the main idea before answering the question. In this case, I should have paid closer attention to the discussion of Morrison's narrative style and its connection to music, rather than focusing solely on the mention of other works by Morrison.

Pay attention to the information provided in the passage and identify the correct answer choice based on that information. The passage provides ample information about the connection between Jazz and music, which should have led me to choose option E.

Explanation:
The passage states that abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s. Additionally, it mentions that pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. This implies that abstract expressionism moved from intensity to lyricism over time, which is the correct answer.

Previously, I incorrectly answered this question as ""B"".
Upon reflection, I realized that the passage does not suggest that the conclusion about alcohol's effects on lipid processing should be questioned. Instead, the passage suggests that moderate wine consumption may have healthful effects that are distinct from other forms of alcohol. Therefore, choice ""B"" is not the best answer.

Choice ""C"" is the best answer because the passage suggests that the healthful effects of moderate wine consumption may be due to the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages. This implies that moderate consumption of wine made from other fruits, such as plums or apples, may not have the same healthful effects.

The other choices are not supported by the passage. Choice ""A"" is not supported because the passage does not suggest that scientists should not study the possible healthful effects of moderate consumption of beer and distilled spirits.

In my previous answer, I mistakenly chose option A, thinking that the author's primary purpose was to analyze and commend Toni Morrison's contributions to the art of the novel. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the author's primary purpose was actually to demonstrate the similarities between two seemingly dissimilar arts - literature and music - and how they can inform and enrich each other.

The passage highlights how Toni Morrison's novel Jazz draws inspiration from the structure and style of jazz music, specifically Duke Ellington's compositions. The author argues that Morrison's use of multiple narrative voices and perspectives creates a sense of ensemble improvisation within a carefully constructed collective narration, much like how a jazz ensemble performs within the framework of a composer's piece.

The author emphasizes that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

  C: The plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.

  E: Instead of implementing the plan, specific laws regarding the payment of water bills should be introduced to provide a more effective set of incentives.
","  My apologize for my previous response. After reflecting on the question, I realize that my answer was incorrect. The author of passage A would most likely agree with statement D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills.

The author of passage A emphasizes the importance of reducing the social costs of overinclusive rules by using discretionary nonenforcement. However, in the case of the water department's plan, the author would likely argue that placing liens on the properties of those who are late paying their bills would be a more effective and efficient way to collect debts without imposing unnecessary social costs. This approach would allow the water department to collect the money owed without resorting to selective enforcement or punishing innocent property owners.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: A better plan would have been to place liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills.",,,B,0,1238,216,1454,

  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect. The correct answer is option E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.

The passage argues that the second version of multicultural education, which adopts a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods to examine cultures, is problematic. The critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. Therefore, using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is distorting and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

Option E, genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, is the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education. This option highlights the importance of understanding a culture on its own terms, rather than through the lens of Western scientific methods. It suggests that a genuine understanding of another culture requires an appreciation of its unique value system, perspectives, and methods, which may not be captured by Western scientific approaches. Therefore, option E provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.

The other options do not provide as strong an objection to the criticism in the passage. Option A, it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, is not necessarily true, as outsiders can still learn about and understand a culture's perspectives and methods. Option B, many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another, does not address the issue of whether Western scientific methods are appropriate for studying non-Western cultures. Option C, some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, is not necessarily relevant to the criticism in the passage. Option D, students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations, is not related to the criticism in the passage.

Therefore, option E, genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, provides the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.",,,A,0,1157,540,1697,

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. Let's try again.

The correct answer is option A: ""written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture.""

The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to the collaborative process between non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers, where the written accounts of Native American life histories were created based on oral traditions and artifacts of Native American cultures. Therefore, option A accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase.

In contrast, option B describes a collaborative process between two people from different cultures, but it does not specifically refer to the use of oral traditions and artifacts from one culture to create written accounts. Option C refers to a compilation of writings from people from different cultures, but it does not specify that the writings are based on oral traditions and artifacts of one culture. Option D describes a process where a member of one culture writes originally but is edited and revised by a member of another culture, which is not necessarily related to the concept of bicultural composite authorship. Option E describes a process where a member of one culture writes based on oral communication by a member of another culture, which is closer to the meaning of the phrase, but it does not specifically refer to the use of artifacts and oral traditions.

  E: A decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe.
","  Sure, I'd be happy to help you answer this question.

The correct answer is B: A pictograph that represents a specific person incorporates the symbol for a constellation.

The author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures an inclusive view of identity that is relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. The use of a pictograph that incorporates a symbol for a constellation to represent a specific person would be consistent with this view of identity, as it suggests that the person's identity is connected to the natural world and the cosmos.

In contrast, the other options do not align with the author's description of pre-contact Native American cultures' views on identity. Option A, for example, suggests that a person's identity is fixed at birth and is not relational to their community or environment, which contradicts the author's argument. Option C suggests that there is a universal ritual for assuming a new name that is used across diverse communities, which does not align with the author's description of the inclusive and relational nature of identity in pre-contact Native American cultures. Option D suggests that a name given to one member of a community cannot be given to another member of the same community, which may be true in some cultures but does not necessarily reflect the view of identity as inclusive and relational to the cosmos that the author attributes to pre-contact Native American cultures. Option E suggests that a decorated shield that belonged to an individual cannot be traced to a particular tribe, which does not relate to the topic of identity or the author's description of pre-contact Native American cultures' views on identity.
