The argument is that they should choose the option that will generate more revenue and attract more listeners, even if it means deviating from their traditional programming.

The curator's statements indicate that the museum store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection, which are all twentieth-century works. The store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. However, we don't know if every print in the store is of a work that is either on loan or part of the permanent collection. We also don't know if Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan or not.
Action: Answer(""B"")
Explanation:
Since the museum only displays twentieth-century works and the store sells prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection as well as some works not in the permanent collection, it follows that every print sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. This is the only statement that must be true based on the curator's statements.",,B,C,0,568,202,770,

  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
","Thought:
Tamara's objection is that wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to receive warning if a ninja were in the house, implying that ninja activity was prevalent during the Tokugawa period.
Patricia's argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to provide evidence that the squeaky floors were not necessarily a response to ninja activity.
Choice B provides evidence that the squeaky floors were not necessarily a response to ninja activity, as ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound.

Choice A is not necessarily true, as the information provided does not mention any regulations.

  D: The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers.
  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
","Thought:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins. We can also infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. However, we cannot infer that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others, since the information provided does not mention breeds. We also cannot infer that the allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers, since the information provided does not mention the intensity of allergic reactions. Finally, we cannot infer that there is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer, since the information provided does not mention prediction.
