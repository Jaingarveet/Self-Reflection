Choices:
  A: number of leaves that fall during winter
  B: change in leaf color during the autumn season
  C: type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil
  D: amount of water that is available for growth
","Choices:
  A: number of leaves that fall during winter
  B: change in leaf color during the autumn season
  C: type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil
  D: amount of water that is available for growth
","Thought:
Inherited traits are passed down from parent to offspring through genes. 
Options A, B, and D are influenced by environmental factors, not genetics.
The type of mineral absorbed is likely determined by the tree's genetic makeup.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","Thought:
The introduction of a predator will likely favor traits that aid in escaping or hiding. Since the sheep with light wool have increased in number despite the strength advantage of dark wool sheep, it suggests their lighter color might offer better camouflage or other survival benefits.

  D: the squeezing of food through the intestines
","Thought:
Physical changes involve alterations in form or state, not chemical composition. 
Options B and C describe chemical changes due to the alteration of molecules.
Option A describes the formation of a food bolus, which is a physical change.
Option D describes the movement of food, which is also a physical change.
Between A and D, squeezing food through the intestines seems more significant in the context of digestion.
