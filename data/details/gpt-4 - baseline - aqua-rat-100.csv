","Thought: 
The diameter of the sphere is the same as the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. 
The formula to find the diagonal of a rectangular solid is √(l² + w² + h²), where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the rectangular solid respectively. 
So, the diagonal of the rectangular solid is √(3² + 4² + 15²) = √(9 + 16 + 225) = √250 = 15.8113. 
This is the diameter of the sphere.
Action: Answer(""B"")","In an inscribed rectangle in a sphere, we will have a line joining the opposite vertices as the diameter.
According to the Pythagoras theorem, sides 3, 4 give diagonal as 5 ==> with 5 and 15, we get 5sqrt(10).
5sqrt(10) or 15.8113 is the diameter of the sphere.

Amy can use a single letter to represent one type of book. For a pair of two different letters, she can represent (n*(n-1))/2 types of books, where n is the number of different letters. 
Let's try to find the smallest number of letters needed. 
If Amy uses 3 letters:
Single letter codes: 3

Total types of books that can be represented: 3 + 3 = 6
If Amy uses 4 letters:
Single letter codes: 4

At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)

Action: Answer(""B"")","Let 'x' be the distance and 'y' be the speed of the forward journey. Then, we have 6v=d and 4(v+12)=d

The initial ratio of boys to girls is 64:40, which simplifies to 8:5. 
The final ratio is 4:3. 
Since the same number of boys and girls joined, the difference in the ratios should be equal. 
The difference in the ratio of boys is 4 - 8 = -4, and the difference in the ratio of girls is 3 - 5 = -2. 
This means that for every 4 boys that joined, 2 girls joined. 
Since the number of boys and girls that joined is the same, the number of boys and girls that joined is 2 * 2 = 4. 
So, the total number of members now is 64 + 40 + 4 = 108.

","Thought: 
Let's denote the number of toys made by Alex as A and the number of toys made by Jacob as J. We know that A + J = 35. 
Since they worked for almost the same number of hours, the ratio of toys made by Alex to Jacob is the inverse of the ratio of time it takes for them to make a toy. So, A/J = 9/7.
We can solve these two equations to find the number of toys made by Jacob.
Action: 
First, substitute A = 35 - J into the second equation: (35 - J)/J = 9/7.
Solving this equation gives J = 15. 
So, Jacob made 15 toys.
Answer(""A"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

The selling price of the article is Rs. 360, and this is 120% of the cost price (because it includes a 20% profit).

  E: None of these
","Thought:
The car is moving at a uniform speed, and the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. 
In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. 
When the angle of elevation is 45°, the distance of the car from the base of the tower is equal to the height of the tower (since tan(45°) = 1). 
When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance of the car from the base of the tower is the height of the tower divided by √3 (since tan(60°) = √3). 
The difference in these distances is the distance the car travels in 10 minutes. 
So, the car travels a distance equal to the height of the tower (1 - 1/√3) in 10 minutes. 
To reach the base of the tower (a distance equal to the height of the tower), the car will need to travel for a time proportional to the inverse of the distance it has already traveled. 
So, the time it will take is 10 minutes * (1 / (1 - 1/√3)) = 10 * (√3 + 1) minutes.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Let's denote the total number of matches played by Sachin before the final as x. 
So, his total runs before the final would be 51x (since average = total/number of matches).
After the final, his total runs would be 51x + 78 and the total number of matches would be x + 1.
His new average after the final is 54, so we can set up the equation 54 = (51x + 78)/(x + 1).
Solving this equation will give us the value of x, and adding 1 to x will give us the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season.
Action: 
First, we need to solve the equation for x:
54 = (51x + 78)/(x + 1)
54(x + 1) = 51x + 78
54x + 54 = 51x + 78
3x = 24
x = 8
So, Sachin played 8 matches before the final. Adding the final, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8 + 1 = 9.
Answer(""C"")","Let total number of matches = x
then, total runs 54*x

The total number of smaller cubes is 5*5*5 = 125.
The number of smaller cubes that make up the outer layer is 3*3*3 = 27.
So, the number of smaller cubes that are inside and not painted is 125 - 27 = 98.
Each of these unpainted smaller cubes has 6 faces, so the total number of unpainted faces is 98*6 = 588.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of M and J.

Let's denote the number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic as x. The total cost of the eatables is Rs. 96, so each friend was supposed to contribute Rs. 96/x. However, 4 friends did not show up, so the remaining x-4 friends had to contribute Rs. 96/(x-4). According to the problem, this amount is Rs. 4 more than the original contribution, so we have the equation 96/(x-4) = 96/x + 4. Solving this equation will give us the number of friends who attended the picnic.
Action: 
First, we need to solve the equation for x. We can start by multiplying all terms by x(x-4) to get rid of the fractions:
96x = 96(x-4) + 4x(x-4)
Simplifying this gives:
96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x
Rearranging terms and simplifying further gives:
4x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0
Dividing all terms by 4 gives:
x^2 - 4x - 96 = 0
This is a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can solve it using the quadratic formula x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a):
x = [4 ± sqrt((4)^2 - 4*1*(-96))] / (2*1)
x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 384)] / 2
x = [4 ± sqrt(400)] / 2
x = [4 ± 20] / 2
x = 24/2 or -16/2
We discard the negative solution because the number of friends cannot be negative. So, x = 12. This is the total number of friends who were supposed to go to the picnic. Since 4 friends did not show up, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 12 - 4 = 8.

Let's denote the speed of the ship as 's' (in miles per hour), and the time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship as 't' (in hours). 
The ship has a head start of 180 miles, and travels at speed 's'. So, the distance covered by the ship is 's*t + 180'. 
The plane travels at 10 times the speed of the ship, so its speed is '10s'. The distance covered by the plane is '10s*t'. 
Since they meet at the same point, the distances they cover are equal. So, we have the equation 's*t + 180 = 10s*t'. 
Solving this equation for 't', we get 't = 180 / 9 = 20 hours'. 
Substituting 't' back into the equation for the distance covered by the ship, we get 's*20 + 180 = 200s'. 
Since the speed of the ship 's' is irrelevant to the question, we can ignore it. The distance from the starting point when they meet is '200s', which is 200 miles.

Then, we add the amounts of zinc and copper from both alloys to get the amounts in alloy Z. The amount of zinc is 16+23.33=39.33 grams and the amount of copper is 24+36.67=60.67 grams.
Finally, we find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing both amounts by their greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor of 39.33 and 60.67 is approximately 1. So, the ratio is approximately 39:61, which is not one of the choices.
However, if we round the amounts to the nearest whole number, we get 39 grams of zinc and 61 grams of copper, which gives a ratio of 39:61. This is also not one of the choices.
Therefore, there seems to be a mistake in the question or the choices.
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"")","The ratio of zinc and copper in mixture 1 is 6/9 and in mixture 2 is 7/11.

The time it takes for each ball to make a full rotation can be calculated. 
For ball A, it takes 26 minutes/2 rotations = 13 minutes per rotation.
For ball B, it takes 35 minutes/5 rotations = 7 minutes per rotation.
We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7 to find when they will be at the same starting point again. 
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91 minutes. 
Action: Answer(""A"")","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by

Let's denote the number of white sharpeners as W and the number of brown sharpeners as B. We know that W + B = 18 (from the total number of sharpeners) and that the cost of the white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the brown ones. If we denote the cost of a brown sharpener as x rupees, then the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1 rupees. The total cost is 100 rupees, so we have the equation W*(x+1) + B*x = 100. 
We can solve this system of equations. Let's start with the first equation. We can express B as 18 - W. 
Substitute B in the second equation: W*(x+1) + (18 - W)*x = 100. 
Simplify: W*x + W + 18*x - W*x = 100. 
This simplifies to: W + 18*x = 100. 
Since W and x must be integers (you can't buy a fraction of a sharpener), we can try different values for W until we find a solution where x is also an integer. 
If we try W = 10, we get: 10 + 18*x = 100, which simplifies to 18*x = 90, and x = 5. 
So, Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.

The total distance of the journey is 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles.
The first quarter of the journey is 1000 miles * 1/4 = 250 miles, which is covered at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so it takes 250 miles / 100 miles/hour = 2.5 hours.
The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles, which is covered at a speed of 75 miles/hour, so it takes 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday (and the rest of the weekdays) as x. Then, the hotel buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. 
The total cost for the newspapers is $210. We know that the cost for the Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x and the cost for the newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is 6x * $1 = $6x. 
So, we can set up the equation: $8x (for Sunday) + $6x (for Monday to Saturday) = $210. 
Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which is the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday.
Action: 
First, combine like terms: 8x + 6x = 14x.
Then, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for x: 210 / 14 = 15.

The profit share is proportional to the capital invested and the time period for which the capital was invested. 
Let's denote the time period for which C's capital was invested as x months. 
A's capital was invested for 12 months, B's capital was invested for 10 months, and C's capital was invested for x months. 
The ratio of their capital investments is 40,000:60,000:120,000, which simplifies to 2:3:6.
The ratio of their time investments is 12:10:x.
Therefore, the ratio of their total investments (capital * time) is 24:30:6x.
Given that C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, the ratio of C's investment to the total investment is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5.
Setting this equal to the ratio of C's total investment to the total investment gives us the equation 6x/(24+30+6x) = 2/5.
Solving this equation for x gives us x = 4 months.
