Given that J is the fourth speaker, this means J speaks after lunch. 
From the conditions, we know that G must speak before lunch, so G is either the first, second, or third speaker. 
We also know that F speaks in the first or third place, so F cannot be the second speaker. 
Since only one speaker is between M and N, and we know that three speakers speak before lunch and three after, M and N must either both speak before lunch or both speak after lunch. 
Since J is already speaking after lunch, M and N must both speak before lunch. 
Therefore, the third speaker must be either F or M, as G is already accounted for in the first or second place.

A: This option suggests that local herders are becoming more aware of the need to protect the salamanders, which could potentially reduce the number of salamanders being trampled. However, it does not directly contradict the expert's opinion.

Option C explains why people favor college students as nannies, but it does not explain why they would not hire them.
Option D does not explain why people favor college students as nannies, and it only partially explains why they would not hire them.
