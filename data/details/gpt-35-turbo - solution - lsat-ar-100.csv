","Choices:

","I previously answered this question incorrectly. 
To solve this problem, I can use a process of elimination. 
If Lan does not lead a Wednesday session, then Lan must lead a Thursday or Friday session. However, Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Therefore, Olivia must lead a Friday session, and Lan must lead a Thursday session. 
Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session. 
Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday. 
If Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, then they must lead sessions on Thursday or Friday. However, Rebecca cannot lead a Thursday session because Lan is leading a Thursday session. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead Friday sessions. 
So, the lab assistants leading Thursday sessions are Lan and Julio.
