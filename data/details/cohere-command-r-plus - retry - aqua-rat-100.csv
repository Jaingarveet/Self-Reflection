She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

  B: 4

","Thought: 
Amy needs to use at least three letters to create unique codes for 10 types of books.

Explanation:
To ensure that each code is unique, Amy needs a minimum of three elements (in this case, letters) to create combinations.

Using a single letter: Amy has 26 choices for each book type, which is more than enough to distinguish 10 types.

Using a pair of letters: Amy can form combinations without replacement from the 26 letters of the English alphabet. The number of combinations, C, when choosing two out of 26 letters without replacement is given by the formula:

C = nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)

where:
- n is the total number of elements (in this case, 26 letters),
- r is the number of elements being chosen (in this case, 2),
- ! denotes factorial (multiplying all numbers from 1 to n).

Plugging in the values, we get:
C = 26! / (2! * (26 - 2)!) = 26 * 25 / (2 * 24) = 325 / 24 ≈ 13.54

So, with pairs of letters, Amy has more than enough combinations to distinguish the 10 types of books.

Therefore, the smallest number of letters needed is 3, as she can create at least 10 unique codes using combinations of 3 letters (either as single letters or pairs).
Action: Answer(""C"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.
Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",C,D,0,412,346,758,

Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)

For the first 12 months (last year), the store sold an average of 42 ovens per month, so for those 12 months, they sold a total of 12 * 42 = 504 ovens.

For the first 10 months of this year, the store sold an average of 20 ovens per month, so for those 10 months, they sold a total of 10 * 20 = 200 ovens.

The total number of ovens sold during the 22-month period is 504 + 200 = 704.

","Action: Answer(""E"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

","Thought: 
The cow is tethered in the middle of the field, so the field is a circle with a radius of 7 feet (half the length of the rope).
The area of the field is $7^2 \pi \approx 154$ square feet.
At a rate of 10 square feet per day, it will take approximately $154 / 10 = \mathbf{15.4}$ \text{ days } for the cow to graze the whole field.

Choice A, 51 days, is too large.
Choice B, 61 days, is too large.
Choice C, 71 days, is too large.

","Thought: 
To maximize distance, we want to travel many long distances, not a short distance with a high initial cost.

Let's calculate the total cost for distances starting from 1 mile:
- 1 mile: $3.50 + $0.10 = $3.60
- 2 miles: $3.50 + $0.20 = $3.70
- 3 miles: $3.50 + $0.30 = $3.80
...
- 11 miles: $3.50 + $1.10 = $4.60
- 12 miles: $3.50 + $1.20 = $4.70

We can see that traveling 12 miles costs more than $8.50, so the maximum distance achievable is 11 miles.

Now, let's calculate the cost for 11.75 miles:
- 11.75 miles: $3.50 + $1.10 + $0.10 = $4.70

This also costs more than $8.50, so the answer is 11 miles, or choice A: 11.75 miles.

","Thought: 
Let's assume C joined for the remaining 8 months, for a total of 10 months, as B joined after 2 months.
In that case, A's share for the year would be (40000*12)/600000*375000 = 90000,
B's share would be (60000*10)/600000*375000 = 150000,
and C's share would be 120000/600000*375000 = 75000,
which is half of the stated amount of 150000.

Therefore, C joined 4 months after B, for a total of 6 months.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Assume that C was there in the business for x months
A:B:C = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x

=8 : 10 : 2x
= 4 : 5 : x
C's share = 375000*x/(9+x) = 150000
=> 375x/(9+x) = 150
=> 15x = 6(9+x)
=> 5x = 18 + 2x
