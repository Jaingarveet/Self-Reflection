","Thought:
The question asks for a statement that would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. The author argues that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly, as larger firms can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business.

Let's evaluate each choice:

A: This statement describes a situation where monopoly power exists without necessarily being connected to increased size. However, it doesn't undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power in general.

B: This statement discusses worker salaries and specialization, which is not directly related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

C: This statement describes a situation where a few large firms collude to set prices as high as a monopoly. This actually strengthens the connection between increased size and monopoly power, rather than undermining it.

D: This statement suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies by industry. If true, this would mean that increased size doesn't always lead to monopoly power, undermining the connection drawn by the author.

E: This statement discusses potential offsets to gains in productivity from specialization. However, it doesn't directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

The main point of the passage is to discuss the two proposals for promoting multicultural understanding and the criticisms they face. The first proposal is to teach about other cultures from within the context of the majority culture, while the second proposal is to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. However, both proposals are criticized for being distorting and Eurocentric.
Action: Answer(""E"")

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by choosing option C, which only focuses on the second proposal and its criticism. However, the main point of the passage is to discuss both proposals and their criticisms. Option E captures this main point by stating that critics claim these proposals are not value neutral and are therefore unable to yield a genuine understanding of cultures with a different value system. This option is the best choice because it accurately reflects the main argument of the passage.",,E,E,1,1268,187,1455,

The author of passage B criticizes the argument made in passage A by suggesting that it is a mistake to assume that any given behavior can be explained solely by an interest in propagating one's genes. The author argues that there are often multiple interests that could explain a particular behavior, and that it is necessary to show that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had a particular interest in order to make a decisive explanation.

The keywords in the question that indicate the author's criticism are ""mistaken assumption"" and ""arguments like that made in passage A.""

Choice B directly addresses the author's criticism by suggesting that it is a mistaken assumption to believe that any action performed by an early human was necessarily orchestrated by that individual's genes to promote the genes' self-propagation. This is consistent with the author's argument that there are often multiple interests that could explain a particular behavior.

Choices A, C, D, and E do not directly address the author's criticism and can be eliminated.

The passage discusses different views on the purpose of literature during Dostoyevsky's time. The radical critics believed that literature should be useful by contributing to the creation of a new society and exposing injustices. However, Dostoyevsky had a different perspective. He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that artistry is the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts.

The question asks for the description of a work of literature as ""useful"" mainly refers to in the context of the passage.

Choice A is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky believed that the fantastic is intimately bound up with the real, he did not believe that proficiency at depicting the realm of the fantastic is the main description of a useful work of literature.

Choice C is incorrect because while the radical critics believed that literature should help bring about social change, Dostoyevsky did not believe that this is the main description of a useful work of literature.

Choice D is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world, he did not believe that this is the main description of a useful work of literature.

Choice E is incorrect because Dostoyevsky did not believe that a work of literature should advance a particular theory of literature.

Choice B is the correct answer because Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's thoughts. Therefore, effectiveness at communicating the author's ideas is the main description of a useful work of literature according to Dostoyevsky.

The author's primary purpose in the passage is to analyze the unique narrative structure of Toni Morrison's novel ""Jazz"" and how it relates to the structure of jazz music. The author provides specific examples of how the narrative shifts between third-person omniscience and first-person lyricism, and how this is analogous to the playing of a jazz band. The author also discusses how Morrison's use of this structure serves to redefine the possibilities of narrative point of view.

","Thought:
The author discusses primary substances in the context of introducing the two categories of chemical substances found in plants. The primary substances are described as being required for growth and proper functioning and found in all plants. In contrast, secondary substances are described as having no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells. The author then goes on to discuss the role of secondary substances in plant evolution and their relationship with insects.

The author's purpose for discussing primary substances is to help explain what secondary substances are by contrasting them with primary substances.

  E: Instead of implementing the plan, specific laws regarding the payment of water bills should be introduced to provide a more effective set of incentives.
","Thought:
The author of passage A argues that law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws or applications of law by declining to prosecute violators. This power is exercised frequently to reduce the costs of overinclusion, which refers to the situation where a rule forbids some conduct that the legislature did not intend to forbid. The author suggests that discretionary nonenforcement is a technique that can reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.

In passage B, officials plan to selectively cut off water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. However, the author of passage A would likely argue that this plan is an example of overinclusion, as it would impose heavy social costs by punishing innocent people (i.e., those who are unable to pay their bills due to financial hardship) in order to reduce the probability of acquitting guilty ones (i.e., those who can afford to pay but choose not to).

The author of passage A would likely agree with option D, which suggests placing liens on the properties owned by those who are late paying their bills. This alternative method of law enforcement would reduce the costs of overinclusion by targeting only those who are truly responsible for the debt, rather than punishing innocent people.
