  A: It is made up of more than one substance.
  B: It is impossible to separate the substances.
  C: The components retain their original properties.
  D: The components chemically combine with each other.
","Thought:
The key characteristic of a mixture is that its components retain their individual properties. 
The snack's ingredients, like peanuts and raisins, keep their own taste and texture even when mixed.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:
  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool

  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
