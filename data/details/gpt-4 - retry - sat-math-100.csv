A line passes through the origin if the equation of the line is in the form y = mx, where m is the slope of the line. The slope of the line determined by the points (2, k) and (k, 32) is (32-k)/(k-2). Setting this equal to 0 (since the line passes through the origin and thus has a slope of 0), we get 32-k = 0, which gives k = 32. However, this is not one of the options. Therefore, the line does not have a slope of 0, but rather, it passes through the origin, meaning the product of the coordinates of any point on the line should be zero. So, 2*k = 0 or k*32 = 0. This gives k = 0 as a possible value.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$. Multiplying each side of $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$ by $2 k$ gives $k^{2}=64$, from which it follows that $k=8$ or $k=-8$.

","Thought: 
The relationship between x and y is linear, so it can be represented by the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 
The slope can be calculated by taking the difference in y-values divided by the difference in x-values between any two points. 
From the table, the slope m = (0 - (-a)) / (a - 3a) = a / -2a = -1/2. 
The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0, which is not given in the table. 
However, we can use the point (a, 0) to find the y-intercept. Substituting x = a and y = 0 into the equation y = mx + b gives 0 = -1/2*a + b, so b = a/2. 
So the equation of the line is y = -1/2*x + a/2. 
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fractions gives 2y = -x + a. 
Rearranging gives x + 2y = a, which corresponds to choice A.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$.

The second equation is 1.6x + 0.5y = -1.3

The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites.

The equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$ can be expanded to $abx^2 + (7a+2b)x + 14 = 15x^2 + cx + 14$. 
Since the equation holds for all values of x, the coefficients on the left must equal the coefficients on the right. 
So, $ab = 15$ and $7a+2b = c$.

If we solve $ab = 15$ and $a+b = 8$ for a and b, we get two pairs of solutions: (a,b) = (3,5) or (5,3).

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.
