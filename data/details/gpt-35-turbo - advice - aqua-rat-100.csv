The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid inscribed in it.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the three dimensions of the rectangular solid.
The square of the diagonal is 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 = 250.
The diagonal is the square root of 250, which is approximately 15.8113.

The original square piece of cloth has four equal sides.
Let's assume that each side of the original square piece of cloth is ""x"" feet long.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new rectangular piece has one side that is ""x-4"" feet long and the other side that is still ""x"" feet long.
The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
The two triangles are congruent, so they have the same base and height.
Let's assume that the base of each triangle is ""b"" feet long and the height of each triangle is ""h"" feet long.
Then, we have the following equation: (1/2) * b * h = 70.
Solving for ""h"", we get h = 140 / b.
The diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides ""x-4"" and ""h"".
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get (x-4)^2 + h^2 = x^2.
Substituting h = 140 / b, we get (x-4)^2 + (140 / b)^2 = x^2.
Simplifying, we get b^2 * (x-4)^2 + 140^2 = b^2 * x^2.

Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of a house per day.
Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of a house per day.
Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of a house per day.
After 8 days, Mr.Brown has completed 8*(1/6) = 4/3 of the work.

Mr.Black works for 6 days, so he completes 6*(1/8) = 3/4 of the remaining work.
The total work done is 4/3 + 3/4 = 7/3 of the work.
The remaining work is 1 - 7/3 = 2/3 of the work.

There are 10 different types of books, and each type can be represented by either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If we use a single letter to represent each type, we would need at least 10 letters of the alphabet. If we use pairs of letters, we would need to choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first pair, and 25 letters out of 26 for the second pair (since we cannot repeat the first letter). However, since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting. Therefore, the total number of pairs of letters is (26*25)/2 = 325. We need to choose the smallest number of letters, so we should choose the option that is less than 10 and greater than 325/26.

Let's assume the speed of the jeep on the forward journey is S km/hr.

The outer surface of the cube is painted, which means all the faces of the outer layer of the cube are painted.
The given cube is of size 5cm, with a thickness of 1cm, which means the inner cube is of size 3cm.
The number of smaller cubes on the outer layer of the cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150.
Each face of the smaller cube has an area of 1cm^2.
Therefore, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 150 x 6 - 100 = 800.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

The total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96.
The amount each person would have to contribute if all of them attended the picnic is 96/x.
Since 4 of them did not turn up, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.

The man wants to catch the first train that comes, which means he can catch either the main line or the harbor line.
The main line train starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line train starts at 5.02 A.M.
The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, which means they will arrive every 10 minutes.
To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to calculate the probability of him catching the main line train or the harbor line train.
The probability of him catching the main line train is the probability of him arriving between 5 o'clock and 5.10 A.M.
The probability of him catching the harbor line train is the probability of him arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.12 A.M.
We can calculate these probabilities by dividing the time interval by the frequency of the trains.
The total probability of him catching either train is the sum of these probabilities.

From the first scenario, we know that:
- Time = 10 minutes
- Distance = n - 20 (since we stop at the 20th step)
- Speed = s steps/minute
Using the formula: Distance = Speed x Time, we can write:
n - 20 = s x 10
n = 10s + 20
From the second scenario, we know that:
- Time = 20 minutes
- Distance = n - 10 (since we stop at the 10th step)
