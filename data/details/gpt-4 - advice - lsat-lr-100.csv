The radio producer's argument is based on a necessity that forces a choice between two options. The necessity is the need for advertising revenue to pay bills. The two options are sticking with classical music or devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music. The option that does not meet the necessity is sticking with classical music. Therefore, the producer concludes that they should devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music. 
Looking at the answer choices, option A presents a similar pattern of reasoning. The necessity is cost. The two options are buying blinds or making curtains. The option that does not meet the necessity is buying blinds. Therefore, the conclusion is that they should make curtains.
