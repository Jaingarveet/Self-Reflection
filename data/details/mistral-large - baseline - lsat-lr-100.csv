  C: The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two.
  D: New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program.
  E: To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.

The ethicist's argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to it. The conclusion is that we must reject Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.

To properly draw this conclusion, we need to assume that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action does not necessarily mean that we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. Instead, it would allow us to determine whether the action was freely performed and, therefore, whether the person is responsible for it.

Choice C aligns with this assumption, as it states that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard it as freely performed. This implies that knowing a lot about the events leading up to an action would allow us to determine whether it was freely performed, rather than necessarily leading us to regard it as not freely performed.

The argument assumes that because more cocker spaniels are registered in Flynn Heights than in any other neighborhood, a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights is likely to belong to someone in Flynn Heights. However, this assumption could be flawed if cocker spaniels are more likely to stray than other breeds, or if there are simply more dogs in Flynn Heights overall.

To evaluate the argument, it would be most useful to know whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners (choice A). If cocker spaniels are more likely to stray, then it would be more likely that a stray cocker spaniel found near Flynn Heights belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. However, if cocker spaniels are not more likely to stray, then the argument is weaker.

The reasoning in the original argument is that while a certain action (adopting a diet based on fish protein) has benefits for individuals, it would have negative consequences if universally adopted (extinction of marine species).

Choice A presents a similar structure, where a certain action (taking vitamin E supplements) has benefits for individuals, but it is not recommended for everyone due to safety concerns.

  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
","Thought:
Patricia's argument is that there was very little ninja activity in Japan during the Tokugawa period and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara's objection is that many wealthy Japanese had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors to warn them of ninjas.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the squeaky floors were not necessarily for the purpose of detecting ninjas.
Choice B is the strongest counter because it shows that even if the floors were squeaky, ninjas could still move around undetected, which weakens Tamara's argument that the floors were specifically designed to detect ninjas.

  D: No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun.

The science journalist states that brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres because they do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace to consume it. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because it has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.

Based on this information, we can infer that:

* Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun (A) is not necessarily true because it could also be a brown dwarf that has consumed all its lithium.
* Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements (B) is not necessarily true because brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres but do not have a fully functional nuclear furnace.
* No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf (C) is true because brown dwarfs have lithium in their atmospheres.

The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva.

However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins. We can also infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. However, we cannot infer that any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others, since the information does not mention breeds specifically.

The statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains is used to support the main conclusion of the argument, which is that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised.

The argument assumes that technology cannot be beneficial to society as a whole if it is motivated by personal gain or commercial viability. However, this assumption is not necessarily true. Many technological innovations have been motivated by personal gain and commercial viability, but have still had significant societal benefits.

  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
","Thought:
The professor argues that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary. The professor's conclusion is that the argument for freedom of thought fails because it does not take into account the need for intellectual discipline.

To make the professor's conclusion follow logically, we need to assume that intellectual discipline is incompatible with freedom of thought. This is because the professor's argument is that freedom of thought is not enough for intellectual progress, and that intellectual discipline is also necessary. If intellectual discipline is compatible with freedom of thought, then the argument for freedom of thought would not necessarily fail.

Choice E assumes that intellectual discipline is necessary for freedom of thought, which is the opposite of what we need to assume to make the professor's conclusion follow logically. Choice D assumes that freedom of thought leads to creativity, which is not necessarily incompatible with intellectual discipline. Choice B assumes that intellectual progress can only occur in a society that values it, which is not necessarily incompatible with freedom of thought. Choice A assumes that limiting one's line of thought hinders intellectual progress, which is not necessarily incompatible with freedom of thought.

Choice C assumes that thinkers in societies that protect freedom of thought invariably lack intellectual discipline, which is what we need to assume to make the professor's conclusion follow logically.

","Thought:
The argument assumes that the harm resulting from theft is equal to the harm resulting from bribery because the penalties for both crimes are identical. To strengthen this argument, we need to find evidence that supports the assumption that lawmakers mandate penalties based on the harm resulting from the crimes.

Choice A directly supports the assumption by stating that lawmakers generally mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
