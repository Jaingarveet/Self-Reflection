  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step based on the information provided in the passage:
1. The first version of multicultural education advocates teaching about other cultures from the perspective and values of the majority liberal Western culture. 
2. Critics argue this approach distorts the understanding of other cultures that may not share liberal values.
3. The second version adopts a neutral stance regarding cultural value differences, but still uses Western scientific methods to examine other cultures.
4. Critics of the second version argue that Western scientific methods are value-laden, prizing objectivity, logic, and empirical verification. Insisting on using these methods to understand nonscientific cultures is distorting and expresses a form of cultural chauvinism.
5. The critics believe real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the often nonscientific perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Given this, the critics would most likely object to choice D: ""a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values."" 
This commits the error of using the theories and values of one culture to judge another, rather than trying to understand the other culture on its own terms using its own perspectives and methods. This goes against the key principle the critics advocate.

","You're right, upon re-reading the passage carefully, it's clear that while three positions are presented, only Dostoyevsky's third position is differentiated in detail from specifically the second, radical position. The first position is only briefly mentioned without much elaboration.
The passage spends multiple paragraphs explaining how Dostoyevsky's views on reality, the fantastic, artistry, and the purpose of literature contrast with the radical critics' perspective. However, there is no similar detailed comparison made between Dostoyevsky's position and the first position that held art above everyday reality.
Therefore, the organization of the passage is best described by choice C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.

Looking at the choices:
A) This would support, not call into question, the author's assertion.
B) This directly contradicts the author's claim that Morrison was the first to structure a novel based on a musical genre. It would definitively disprove the assertion, not just call it into question.
C) This is an overly broad generalization. The author is making a specific claim about Morrison's novel, not all novels about nonliterary arts.
D) This choice subtly undermines the author's point by suggesting that any novel can be considered musical to some degree. It calls into question whether Morrison's use of jazz structure was truly unique or groundbreaking.
E) This is not directly relevant to the author's main assertion about the structure of Morrison's novel.
Choice D would most call the author's assertion into question, by implying that the ""musical"" nature of Morrison's novel may not be as distinctive as claimed, since any novel can be found somewhat musical.

","Based on the reflection, the key principle underlying the arguments in both passages is that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable. While the passages reach different conclusions, they both focus on the lack of uniform, objective criteria used by fingerprint examiners in making identifications.
Passage A acknowledges the lack of a ""generally accepted standard"" for the number of matching points required to declare a match. However, it argues this is outweighed by the long history and general acceptance of fingerprint evidence.
Passage B emphasizes the lack of consensus on what constitutes a match, varying practices around ""point-counting"", and the absence of data on the likelihood of partial prints from different people matching. It sees these issues as critical to assessing the reliability of fingerprint evidence.
So while they draw different conclusions, both passages' arguments hinge on the premise that objective standards are needed for fingerprint analysis to be reliable. This most closely matches choice E.

","You're right, upon further reflection I see that the author believes the twofold obligation of defense lawyers to both the defendant and the court/society ultimately benefits the defendant. The key evidence is in these lines:
""The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the ""best defense"" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case.""
The author is confident this twofold obligation allows lawyers to properly balance their responsibilities and provide the best possible defense when merited by the facts of the case. The passage does not focus on the twofold obligation preventing lawyers from representing guilty clients, uncovering facts, avoiding conflicts of interest, or interfering with common defense strategies.

This directly states that the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances like the products of the uranium experiments. 
None of the other answer choices are directly supported by the passage:
A and B talk about earlier theoretical calculations about splitting atoms, but the passage suggests these were largely overlooked or not connected to the experimental results, rather than being neglected or reevaluated. 
C is false, as the passage states that barium was conclusively identified as one of the products.
D is not mentioned at all.
Therefore, the best answer choice that is explicitly supported by the passage is E - the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances.

","You're right, I did focus too much on the various advantages of digital publishing mentioned in the passage, rather than honing in on what the author sees as the key driver of the transition to the digital model.
Upon re-reading, the author's main argument becomes clear - that literary agents demanding higher royalties for authors will force traditional publishers to either adapt to the more efficient digital model, or lose authors to digital-only upstart firms. This pressure from agents is presented as the primary impetus that will drive the shift.
The other factors like keeping books in print, consumer tastes, marketing strategies, and data storage are mentioned more as features or results of the digital transition, not the root cause the author points to.

The passage also says ""The term 'proverb' refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context"". This further reinforces choice D by indicating proverbs don't require surrounding verbal context to be understood.
While the passage does discuss proverbs conveying a sense of ethnicity to Mexican American children, this is a more specific point. It's not as strongly implied as the fundamental nature of how proverbs work, which choice D captures.

1. The passage discusses the conflict between the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) and Invisible Hand (perfect competition enabled by diminishing returns) concepts in economics.
2. It states that the Invisible Hand concept dominated economic thought for a long time because the math behind diminishing returns was easier to formalize. 
3. However, many real-world industries, like railroads, exhibited increasing returns to scale (the Pin Factory concept). 
4. Economists tried to incorporate the Pin Factory concept to account for such industries, but struggled to do so with mathematical rigor.
5. The railroad example illustrates an industry with increasing returns, which the Invisible Hand concept fails to properly explain.
Therefore, the railroad example serves to highlight the limitations of economists' overemphasis on the Invisible Hand, which assumes diminishing returns. It points to a real industry that the Invisible Hand concept cannot adequately describe.

The key points of the criticism of the second version of multicultural education are:
1) The Western scientific methods used are value-laden and distorting when applied to non-Western cultures. 
2) Real understanding requires adopting the internal, often non-scientific perspectives of the cultures being studied.
To provide the strongest objection, we need to find a choice that undermines one or both of these points.
Choice A says it's impossible to truly adopt another culture's perspectives unless you are a member of that culture. However, this actually seems to support the criticism rather than object to it. 
Choice B notes similarities between many non-Western value systems. But this is tangential and doesn't address the core of the criticism about methodology.
Choice C says some non-Western societies use their own values to study other cultures. This somewhat parallels the criticism, but doesn't directly refute the key claim that external methods prevent genuine understanding.
Choice D is about Western students understanding their own culture's achievements through a scientific lens. This seems unrelated to the specific criticism being made.
Choice E states that genuine understanding is necessary to appreciate another culture. This aligns with and supports the criticism rather than objecting to it.
After analyzing each choice, A seems to provide the strongest counter to the criticism. If it is in fact impossible for outsiders to truly adopt another culture's perspectives, then the criticism's proposed solution of using internal viewpoints is untenable. This strikes at a core premise of the argument.
