  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Thought: 
The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education, which advocates for a neutral stance towards value differences among cultures and uses Western scientific methods for examination. However, it does not advocate for using the theories of one society to criticize another society with different values. Therefore, a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values (Choice D) would be objectionable to these proponents.

The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that no writer had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz. This assertion would be most called into question if it were true that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music.
