  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
","Thought: The correct answer is that if specialized workers do not lead to increased productivity, this would undermine the connection between firm size and productivity advantage, and by extension, monopoly power. This is because the argument for increasing returns to scale relies on the assumption that specialized workers are more productive, and thus larger firms have a cost advantage.

Answer ""E"" directly addresses this, stating that any gains from further specializing workers are offset by other factors, challenging the notion that increased specialization always leads to increased productivity and cost advantages for larger firms.

Passage A discusses the theory of evolutionary psychology and how it attempts to explain altruistic behavior from an evolutionary standpoint. It introduces the idea that altruism may have evolved due to the presence of shared genetic material in early human ancestors, which triggered psychological states of identification and empathy. This explanation focuses on how these psychological states, brought about by cues of kinship, could have led to behaviors that ultimately promoted the propagation of genes influencing these states.

Passage A defends the use of fingerprint evidence in criminal trials, arguing that while there may be some variation in practices and a lack of established error rates, the technique has been widely used and accepted for many years, and examiners adhere to consistent standards. It mentions that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.

Passage B criticizes the lack of objective standards and consensus in fingerprint examination, highlighting the uncertainty around error rates and the absence of a generally agreed-upon standard for declaring a match. It questions the reliability of fingerprint evidence due to the lack of systematic studies on error rates and the variation in local practices.

The key point of contention between the authors is the reliability and scientific status of fingerprint identification, with one author defending its longstanding use and the other criticizing the lack of rigorous scientific support.

  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
","Thought: The critics discussed would agree that understanding a culture through the lens of another culture's perspective, specifically the majority culture, is insufficient and may be distorted. They argue for the importance of recognizing the unique perspectives and methods of each culture, especially when those cultures differ significantly from the Western scientific perspective.

Choice A is incorrect because it is a broad statement that lacks the specificity addressed in the passage. While it may be true that understanding cultural values is influenced by one's own cultural context, the critics' argument focuses specifically on the methods and perspectives used to understand other cultures.

Choice B is close but lacks the nuance presented in the passage. While historical and social circumstances are mentioned, the critics emphasize the need to adopt the specific perspectives and methods of the culture being studied, not just acknowledging their potential influence.

Choice C is incorrect because it dilutes the critics' argument. While they emphasize the importance of adopting the perspective of the culture being studied, they do not suggest that multiple cultural perspectives are necessary. The focus is on escaping the biases of the majority culture's perspective.

Choice D is the opposite of the critics' argument. They argue that genuine understanding is possible precisely when we recognize and respect cultural differences, rather than insisting on shared values as a prerequisite for understanding.

Choice E is the correct answer. The critics argue that the methods and perspectives of Western science, with its emphasis on objectivity and empirical verification, are inherently value-laden and reflect Western cultural biases. Therefore, understanding values like liberalism requires engaging with them on their own terms, through their respective cultural lenses.

The correct answer is that the reference to railroads illustrates the difficulty of incorporating the concept of the Pin Factory into economic theory in a mathematically rigorous way.

The correct answer is B. The reference to railroads illustrates the challenge of expressing the concept of the Pin Factory (increasing returns to scale) in a mathematically rigorous manner. This portion of the text highlights the tension between the theoretical appeal of the Pin Factory idea and the practical challenges of incorporating it into economic models due to its mathematical complexity.

  E: Marshall's techniques lend themselves to being used even for purposes that Marshall might not have intended.
","Thought: The key phrase in the question is ""most reasonably inferred."" The correct answer should be the one that is most clearly supported by the passage. The passage states that Marshall's work with the NAACP revealed a ""strategic and methodological legacy"" that changed the landscape of public interest law. It also states that his combination of strategies has been widely adopted and used for various purposes, including by those with differing political objectives. Therefore, the correct answer is E: ""Marshall's techniques lend themselves to being used even for purposes that Marshall might not have intended.""

Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not provide enough information to conclude that Marshall's innovations in litigation strategy or his accomplishments on the Supreme Court were undervalued. Choice B is incorrect because, while Marshall's use of sociological and psychological statistics may have been controversial, the passage does not indicate that it was the most controversial or the most successful part of his campaign. Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the use of sociological evidence by lawyers representing private interests. Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not state that Marshall's successes led to the establishment of the first public interest law firms, nor does it describe their establishment as a direct response to his work.

It is important to consider all the information in the passage and make inferences based on the most relevant details to answer this question correctly.

","Thought: 
Passage A discusses the admissibility of fingerprint evidence in a criminal trial, with the defendant challenging the reliability of fingerprint identification theory and the lack of established error rates. The passage concludes that while uniform standards and further testing may be desirable, fingerprint identification has been widely used and accepted for many years, and the trial court was within its discretion to admit the evidence.

Passage B focuses on the lack of consistent and objective standards for fingerprint examination and the resulting uncertainty in declaring a match. It highlights the variation in identification practices, the unknown error rates, and the need for systematic studies to evaluate the reliability of fingerprint identification in criminal cases.

The correct answer is C: differences in the identification practices used by various fingerprint examiners.

Passage A acknowledges that different agencies may have varying standards for positive identification, but it emphasizes the consistent use of the ""points and characteristics"" approach and the existence of uniform standards through training and peer review. On the other hand, Passage B emphasizes the lack of consensus and consistent standards, highlighting the ""point-counting"" method and the criticism of proficiency tests.

By selecting Choice C, we encompass the discussion presented in both passages regarding the reliability of fingerprint identification in the context of differing identification practices and standards employed by fingerprint examiners.
