The passage discusses three versions of multicultural education. The third version argues that real understanding of other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, rather than using Western scientific methods.

The question asks which study would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the third version of multicultural education.

Choice C is a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. This would be objectionable to proponents of the third version of multicultural education because it goes against their belief that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's views on the purpose of literature and its relationship to reality and usefulness. The radical critics believed that art should be useful by depicting reality as it is and contributing to social change. However, Dostoyevsky had a different perspective. He believed that reality was subjective and that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. He also believed that a work of literature should stand or fall on its artistic merit, which he defined as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader fully understands the author's ideas.

The author discusses primary substances in the context of introducing the two categories of chemical substances found in plants. The primary substances are described as being required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. This information is provided to contrast with the secondary substances, which are the focus of the passage.

The author's attitude towards the novel Jazz is positive throughout the passage. The author discusses the novel's connection to music, its unique narrative style, and Morrison's linguistic virtuosity. However, choice C does not explicitly express the author's attitude towards the novel Jazz. Instead, it describes the narration style in the novel.

","Thought:
The author of passage A discusses the use of discretionary nonenforcement by law enforcement agencies to reduce the costs of overinclusion in rules of law. The author argues that this technique can be used to reduce the social costs of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter.
In passage B, officials plan to selectively cut off water to a few residences with outstanding bills in high-income neighborhoods to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. This plan can be seen as an example of discretionary enforcement, as officials are not enforcing the rule to the letter by targeting all 231,000 households that have not paid on time.
The author of passage A would be most likely to agree with choice B, as it suggests that the plan would have a lower social cost than turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time. This is consistent with the author's argument that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the social costs of overinclusive rules.

  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","Thought:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because it still uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden, to study other cultures. The objection argues that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to find a statement that challenges the assumption that using Western scientific methods is inherently problematic or that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary for real understanding.

Choice A is not a strong objection because it does not challenge the assumption that using Western scientific methods is problematic or that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary. It only states that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.

Choice B is not relevant to the criticism because it does not address the use of Western scientific methods or the necessity of adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

Choice C is not a strong objection because it only states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values. It does not challenge the assumption that using Western scientific methods is problematic or that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary.

Choice D is not relevant to the criticism because it only discusses the importance of Western scientific investigations for understanding Western culture's achievements. It does not address the use of Western scientific methods for studying other cultures or the necessity of adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.

Choice E is not a strong objection because it only states that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. It does not challenge the assumption that using Western scientific methods is problematic or that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary.

Action: Answer(""A"")

Reflection:
I initially answered this question incorrectly because I did not fully understand the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that the criticism is based on the assumption that using Western scientific methods is inherently problematic and that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary for real understanding. I then reevaluated the answer choices and determined that choice A is the strongest objection to this criticism because it challenges the assumption that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is necessary. However, upon further reflection, I realized that choice A is not a strong objection because it does not challenge the assumption that using Western scientific methods is problematic. Therefore, I have revised my answer to ""None of the Above"" because none of the answer choices provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. However, since ""None of the Above"" is not an available choice, I will select the best available option, which is choice A.",,A,A,1,1090,643,1733,
