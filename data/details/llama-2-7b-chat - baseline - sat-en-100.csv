C: Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position.

In Passage 1, Douglas criticizes Lincoln for saying that the Constitution is in violation of the law of God and cannot stand, implying that Lincoln's position is unreasonable and misguided. In Passage 2, Lincoln responds by arguing that he never said the Constitution is in violation of the law of God, and that Douglas's criticism misrepresents his position.

Therefore, choice (C) is the best answer.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it.

The passage states that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from monitoring the Venus flytrap's response to varying amounts of electrical current. This is evident in the experiment they conducted where they rigged up very fine electrodes and applied an electrical current to the open lobes of the trap, and measured the electrical charge needed for the trap to close. This information was used to determine the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close, and to determine the amount of electrical current required to flow between the two electrodes to make the trap close.

It is therefore accurate to say that Volkov and his colleagues made the most extensive use of information obtained from measuring the plant's response to varying amounts of electrical current.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov's work was based on Hodick and Sievers's mathematical model in which an electrical charge is required to close the Venus flytrap, that model isn't described as predicting the precise amount of charge required; moreover, although Volkov made use of this earlier model, it served as a starting point, and his work made greater use of the findings generated by his experiment.

The passage describes how Ken Dial and his son Terry observed young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds running along behind their parents and jumping up like popcorn. Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learned to fly, focusing on the Chukar Partridge as a model species. However, during the experiment, Terry observed that the baby Chukars were using their legs instead of flying up to their perches. This observation led to a new discovery, and Ken Dial came up with a series of experiments to film the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles. The birds were found to be using their wings and legs cooperatively, and Ken Dial came up with the term WAIR (wing-assisted incline running) to describe this technique. The passage then goes on to explain the implications of this discovery for the evolution of bird flight.

Therefore, the best choice to reflect the overall sequence of events in the passage is option C, as the passage describes an anomaly observed during an experiment, which led to a new discovery and the modification of the study to better understand the phenomenon.","Choice D is the best answer.

The passage suggests that Usherwood chose to use northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study because they were easily accessible for him and his team to track and observe. The passage states that the researchers used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy, and that a flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. This implies that it was easier to study the ibises because they were already being tracked during their migration, rather than having to track them from scratch. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study is clearly stated at the beginning of the third paragraph: ""The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremit(A)to Europe."" Because the project reintroducing those birds was already underway, it was therefore easy for Usherwood and his team to join it.Choice A is incorrect because it would not be accurate to say that ibises were well acquainted with their migration route, as the third paragraph explains that scientists needed to ""show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route.""

","  Great, let's get started! Grimké's central claim in Passage 2 is:

D: Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.

In Passage 2, Grimké argues that since rights are founded on moral nature, rather than sex, men and women have equal moral rights and responsibilities. She rejects the idea that men have higher rights and responsibilities than women based solely on their sex, and instead argues that individuals should be judged based on their moral nature and their unique roles and responsibilities in life. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Men and women should have equal opportunities to flourish.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66). Her central claim is not that men and women need to work together to change society (choice B), that moral rights are the distinguishing characteristic separating humans from animals (choice C), or that there should be equal opportunities for men and women to advance and succeed.",,A,0,1442,150,1592,

The central claim of Passage 2 is that space mining has positive potential but its effects should be thoughtfully considered before it becomes a reality. The passage highlights the potential benefits of space mining, such as providing valuable resources and spin-off technologies, but also raises concerns about the environmental and ethical implications of exploiting space resources. The author argues that it is important to consider these issues before moving forward with space mining, rather than simply pursuing economic gain without careful consideration. Therefore, the best answer is option B.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. The author of Passage 2 recognizes that space mining may prove beneficial to humanity, stating that ""we all stand to gain: the mineral bounty and spin-off technologies could enrich us all"" (lines 50-52).

","  Based on the content of Passage 2, the most reasonable inference is that Bryan would criticize Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories for being naive.

In Passage 2, Bryan argues that the Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans to resist foreign domination, and that the Republican party should state its position on holding the Philippine Islands permanently. He also notes that the love of liberty is placed in every human heart by God, and that no race of people would welcome a foreign master.

Bryan's argument suggests that he believes the idea of American governance of island territories is unrealistic and naive, as it does not take into account the feelings and aspirations of the islanders. He seems to be implying that the Filipinos would resist any attempt by the American government to establish a colonial regime, and that the idea of a benevolent American empire is not grounded in reality.

Therefore, the answer is (D) naive.","Choice D is the best answer. In Passage 1, Beveridge advocates for American administration of island nations, such as the Philippines. However, in the first paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan warns, ""If it is right for the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party ... must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their ability."" Thus it can most reasonably be inferred from Passage 2 that Bryan would criticize the vision of American governance of island territories that Beveridge presents in Passage 1 for being naive, since the islanders would object to being governed by Americans.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because, in Passage 2, Bryan doesn't imply that Beveridge's vision of American governance of island territories is unrealistic due to most Americans' unwillingness to relocate to distant islands (choice A), deceptive due to the fact that economic domination would be the true goal of the American government (choice B), or impractical due to the islanders' insistence upon an equal distribution of resources (choice C).",,D,0,1389,225,1614,

The conclusion best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is:

C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.

The experiment recorded nerve signals while gently brushing the subjects' arms with their fingertips, and showed that soft stroking prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay in the signal suggested that the nerve impulses were traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers, confirming the presence of these fibers in human hairy skin. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the slow fibers were found to be responsive to gentle pressure, which contradicts the other options. Option A is incorrect because the experiment did not investigate the speed of signal conduction in relation to distance from the brain. Option B is incorrect because the presence of hairs in human skin does not affect the speed of nerve signal conduction. Option D is incorrect because the experiment did not investigate the dependence of nerve signal firing on the strength of pressure applied to the nerve.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer.

Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is that the tendency of certain young birds to jump erratically is a somewhat recent evolved behavior. Ken noticed this behavior in young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds, which led him to design a project to study how baby game birds learned to fly. He observed that these birds jumped up like popcorn, flapping their half-formed wings and taking short hops into the air. This observation led him to conclude that young birds in a controlled research setting are less likely than birds in the wild to require perches when at rest.

According to the narrator, one consequence of Silas adopting Eppie is that he seems more accepting of help from others. The passage states, ""As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.""

In Passage 1, Grimké argues that women should conform to their ""subordinate station"" in society and exercise their influence peacefully and through moral suasion. In contrast, Passage 2 argues that the idea of a subordinate station for women is based on a flawed understanding of human rights and that women have the same moral nature as men, making them equally entitled to the same rights and responsibilities.

Passage 2 directly challenges the central argument of Passage 1 by claiming that the idea of a subordinate station for women is not supported by a moral analysis of human rights. Therefore, choice (B) is the best answer.

In Passage 1, Grimké argues that women have been assigned a subordinate role in society, but this does not mean that their duties or influence are any less important. She emphasizes that women should strive to become cultivated, refined, and benevolent in intellect and action, and that they should use their peaceful and loving nature to gain respect and influence. Grimké also highlights the importance of women's moral nature and their inherent rights as moral beings.

In Passage 2, Grimké responds to Lyman Beecher's argument that men have higher rights and responsibilities than women. She argues that this view is based on a flawed understanding of the relationship between sex and morality. Grimké contends that when human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex becomes insignificant and the differences between men and women in terms of their duties and responsibilities are based on their diverse relations in life, gifts, and talents, rather than their sex.

Throughout the passages, Grimké emphasizes the importance of recognizing and valuing the ethical obligations of women, which are often undervalued or ignored. Therefore, the authors would agree with claim (C) that the ethical obligations of women are often undervalued.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society.

  D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding. 41
","  Great, let's get started! The passage discusses the ideas of two authors, Tocqueville and Mill, on the topic of individual position in society. To answer the question, we need to analyze the ways the authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society.

Tocqueville believes that an individual's position in society should be determined by their sex. He argues that men and women have different natural roles in society, and that these roles should be respected. In contrast, Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor in their position in society. He argues that each person should have the freedom to pursue their interests and abilities without being limited by their sex or any other characteristic.

Therefore, the best answer is (A): Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",,A,0,1459,216,1675,

The passage states that the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.

Choice C is the best explanation for why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer.

The author notes that the procession of educated men has been a ""caravanserai crossing a desert"" for the past twenty years, and that they themselves are now part of that procession. The bridge serves as a metaphor for the passage of time and the continuity of the educated elite, highlighting the idea that the procession of educated men has been a constant presence throughout history.","Choice B is the best answer.

Bryan considers the preference for national sovereignty over foreign rule to be a manifestation of an innate drive in humans toward self-rule. This is evident in Passage 2, where he argues that the Filipinos do not need any encouragement from Americans to resist foreign domination, and that it is impossible to obliterate every word written or spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, as the legacy of perpetual hatred for foreign rule will still exist. Bryan believes that it is a fundamental human desire for self-governance, which is evident in the resistance of the Filipinos and other colonized peoples to foreign rule. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice D is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan argues that the principle of self-rule set forth in the Declaration of Independence is, in fact, a value that all people instinctively aspire to.

D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

The passage explains that the plant needs to maintain a high level of calcium in order to close, and that a single touch to one hair does not reach this level. Therefore, a second touch to a second hair is needed to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap. This delay in closing allows the plant to ensure that it is worth its energy to close the trap, as the prey is large enough to be worth its time.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size.

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

The central difference between Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) view of liberty is that Beveridge presents it as a direct inheritance of European colonization, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.

In Passage 1, Beveridge describes liberty as a ""noble land"" that God has given to the United States, and emphasizes the country's unique destiny as a ""greater England with a nobler destiny."" He presents liberty as a gift from God, and suggests that the United States has a divine mandate to spread its influence and institutions to other regions. This implies that liberty is seen as a product of European colonization and the country's historical mission.

On the other hand, in Passage 2, Bryan argues that the United States cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here. He suggests that the country's commitment to liberty is not just a matter of domestic policy, but is also closely tied to its international reputation and influence. Bryan implies that imperial expansion would undermine the United States' claim to be a champion of liberty and democracy, and that this would damage the country's moral authority in the world.

Therefore, choice (B) best describes the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty.","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",B,B,1,1457,315,1772,
