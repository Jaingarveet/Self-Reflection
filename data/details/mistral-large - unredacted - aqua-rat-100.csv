Explanation:

* Mr. Brown paints 1.33 houses in 8 days.
* Mr. Black paints 0.75 houses in 6 days.
* Together, they have painted 2.08 houses.
* The remaining work is 3 - 2.08 = 0.92 of a house.
* Since Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, he can paint 1/12 of a house in 1 day.
* Therefore, it will take Mr. Blue 0.92 \* 12 = 11.04 days to paint the remaining portion.
* However, since Mr. Blue cannot work for a fraction of a day, he will need to work for a full 11 days to complete the remaining portion of the house.

Therefore, the correct answer is ""D: 11"".","let x is amount of work to be done to paint one house.
So Brown's one day work is x/6, black's can do x/8 work in
one day and blue is x/12.
Total houses is 3, so tatal work to be done is 3x.
3x= 8*(x/6) + 6*(x/8) + y*(x/12)
finally y = 11.
blue will complete the remaining work in 11 days.

","Thought:
Amy can use single letters to code for some of the book types and pairs of letters to code for the rest. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can use combinations to determine the number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of letters.

Let's start with 3 letters (A, B, C). We can use these to code for 3 types of books using single letters. To form pairs, we have 3 choose 2 = 3 combinations (AB, AC, BC). So with 3 letters, we can code for a total of 6 types of books.

Next, let's try 4 letters (A, B, C, D). We can use these to code for 4 types of books using single letters. To form pairs, we have 4 choose 2 = 6 combinations (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD). So with 4 letters, we can code for a total of 10 types of books.

Since Amy has 10 types of books, the smallest number of letters she will need to create the codes for all of them is 4.

Action: Answer(""B"")

Self-reflection:
Previously, I made an error in my calculation of the number of pairs that can be formed from a given set of letters. I incorrectly calculated the number of pairs that can be formed from 3 letters as 6 instead of 3. This led me to choose the incorrect answer of ""A: 3"". After reflecting on the problem and the correct solution, I realized my mistake and corrected my calculation. I now understand that the correct answer is ""B: 4"".","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

Let's denote the train fare for one person as x.
According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)x.
The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512.
So, we can write the equation: 6 \* (4/3)x + 8x = 1512
Solving this equation will give us the value of x.

The company produces 420 units of a computer component every month at a production cost of $110 per component. Therefore, the monthly production cost is 420 \* $110 = $46,200.
The company wants to make a yearly profit of at least $626,400. Therefore, the minimum yearly revenue must be $46,200 \* 12 + $626,400 = $1,190,800.
The company sells all of the components by the end of each month. Therefore, the minimum yearly revenue must be equal to the number of components sold per year multiplied by the minimum selling price per component.
The number of components sold per year is 420 \* 12 = 5,040.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)

Alloy Z has 16 + 23.56 = 39.56 grams of zinc and 24 + 36.44 = 60.44 grams of copper.
The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 39.56 : 60.44, which simplifies to 59 : 91 (approximately). However, since the question asks for the exact ratio, we should not simplify and instead use 39.56 : 60.44. The closest answer choice is ""D: 59:91"".","The ratio of zinc and copper in mixture 1 is 6/9 and in mixture 2 is 7/11.
40 grams of mixture 1 contains 6*40/15=16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper
60 grams of mixture 2 contains 7*60/18=77/3 grams of zinc and 110/3 grams of copper

Explanation:
I made an error in my previous calculation of the time it took Kevin to drive back to A.
The gap in my knowledge was not in understanding the problem but in basic arithmetic.
I knew the correct formula to use but made a calculation error.

Let's denote the distance between A and B as ""d"".
First, we know that Kevin was still 70 miles away from B, 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since he was driving at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour to cover the remaining 70 miles to reach B. Therefore, the total time he spent driving from A to B was 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours.
The time it took him to drive from A to B is equal to the distance between A and B divided by his speed:
d / 70 = 4
Solving for d, we get:
d = 70 \* 4 = 280 miles
Since he drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to drive back is equal to the distance between A and B divided by his speed:
280 / 90 = 3.11 hours (rounded to two decimal places)
The total time he spent driving is equal to the time it took him to drive from A to B plus the time it took him to drive back to A:
4 hours + 3.11 hours = 7.11 hours
However, we know that the total time he spent driving was 3 hours less than twice the time it took him to drive from A to B:
2 \* 4 - 3 = 5 hours
This contradicts our previous calculation of 7.11 hours. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the given choices.
But, if we look at the problem again, we can see that the question asks for the distance between A and B, not the total time Kevin spent driving.
Therefore, the correct answer is the distance between A and B, which we calculated to be 280 miles.

However, none of the given choices match our calculated result. Therefore, the correct answer is ""E: None of the above"".","In the last 70 miles of his approach to B, Kevin was traveling at 70 mph, so he traveled that distance in 1 hr, or 60 minutes. That means, when he arrived at B, 60 minutes had elapsed, and he took (3 hr) – (1 hr) = 2 hr to drive the distance D at 90 mph.

The given property is that the 5-digit number with a 1 after it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
Let's denote the 5-digit number as ABCDE.
According to the given property, ABCDE1 = 3 \* 1ABCDE.

First, let's analyze the right side of the equation:
1ABCDE is equal to 100000 \* A + 10000 \* B + 1000 \* C + 100 \* D + 10 \* E + 1.

Now, let's analyze the left side of the equation:
ABCDE1 is equal to 10000 \* A + 1000 \* B + 100 \* C + 10 \* D + E + 1.

Comparing both sides, we can see that:
100000 \* A + 10000 \* B + 1000 \* C + 100 \* D + 10 \* E + 1 = 3 \* (10000 \* A + 1000 \* B + 100 \* C + 10 \* D + E + 1).

Simplifying the equation, we get:
70000 \* A + 7000 \* B + 700 \* C + 70 \* D + 7 \* E = 2.

Since all the coefficients on the left side are multiples of 7, the number must be divisible by 7.

Now, let's check the given options:
A: 42857 -> 4 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 26, not divisible by 7.
B: 32456 -> 3 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20, not divisible by 7.
C: 76523 -> 7 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 = 23, not divisible by 7.
D: 24567 -> 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 24, divisible by 7.
E: 43566 -> 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 24, divisible by 7.

However, we need to check if the given property holds true for the remaining options.

For option D:
245671 = 3 \* 124567 -> 245671 = 373701, which is false.

For option E:
435661 = 3 \* 143566 -> 435661 = 430698, which is false.

","Thought:
The ages of the members are in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a common difference of 3 months (or 1/4 year).
The youngest member is 7 years old, so the first term (a) of the A.P. is 7.
The sum of the ages of all the members is 250 years.
To find the number of members (n), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression:
Sum = n * (2a + (n - 1) * d) / 2
where Sum is the sum of the ages (250), a is the first term (7), d is the common difference (1/4), and n is the number of terms (members).
We can rearrange the formula to solve for n:
n = (Sum * 2) / (2a + (n - 1) * d)
Substituting the given values:
n = (250 * 2) / (2 * 7 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
We can simplify and solve for n:
n = 500 / (14 + (n - 1) * 1/4)
n = 500 / (14 + n/4 - 1/4)
n = 500 / (13 + n/4)
4n = 2000 / (13 + n/4)
4n(13 + n/4) = 2000
52n + n^2 = 2000
n^2 + 52n - 2000 = 0
Factoring the quadratic equation:
(n - 25)(n + 80) = 0
The possible values for n are 25 and -80. Since the number of members cannot be negative, the number of members is 25.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Let, n be the number of members in the club.Then,

The ratio of pita breads to rolls is 6:2 or simplified to 3:1.
The ratio of rolls to baguettes is 3:5.
To compare pita breads to baguettes, we need to find a common factor between rolls and pita breads.
We can multiply the first ratio by 3 and the second ratio by 1 to get the same number of rolls:
(3:1) x 3 = 9:3
(3:5) x 1 = 3:5
Now we can compare pita breads to baguettes:
9 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 3 rolls, and 3 rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.
Therefore, 9 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes.
To find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes, we can set up a proportion:
9/5 = x/2

The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, so they will arrive at the station at the same time every 10 minutes.
The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M., which means that the harbor line train will arrive 2 minutes after the main line train.
Since the frequency is 10 minutes, the man will have to wait for either 2 minutes or 8 minutes for the next train.
The probability of catching the first train is the ratio of the time he waits for the first train to the total time between the arrival of two consecutive trains.
The probability of catching the main line train is 2/10 = 0.2, and the probability of catching the harbor line train is 8/10 = 0.8.
The total probability of catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of catching either train, which is 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.
However, since the man can only catch one train, the probability of catching the first train is the probability of catching the train that arrives first.

First, simplify the expression for x:
x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Notice that the numerator is a perfect square trinomial:
x = (n + √n + 4)^2 / (n + 4√n + 4)

Now, let's multiply the conjugate of the denominator to the numerator and denominator:
x = (n + √n + 4)^2 / (n + 4√n + 4) \* (n - 4√n + 4) / (n - 4√n + 4)

Simplify the expression:
x = (n^2 - 16) / (n - 4√n + 4)

Now, let's substitute the minimum and maximum values of n to find the range of x:

For n = 36:
x = (36^2 - 16) / (36 - 4√36 + 4) = 28

For n = 72:

Action: Answer(""A"")","Total cost=100
number of sharp=18
cost of white=cost of brown+1
100/18=5.5...-(1)
also 100%18=10...-(2)
as cost of white is 1 more than that of brown
from 1 int. value will be 5
now remainder is 10 so 10 sharp. will be of cost (5+1)
=> 10*(5+1)+8*5

John starts with a 50% strong milk tea. He replaces 15% of it with milk twice, which means he replaces 15% of 50% = 7.5% with milk twice, resulting in a 35% strong milk tea. Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, which means he replaces 10% of 35% = 3.5% with milk, resulting in a 31.5% strong milk tea.

Action: Answer(""E"")

Explanation:
I answered the question incorrectly before because I made a calculation error. To avoid this mistake, I carefully followed the instructions and calculated the final concentration of tea step-by-step. I first calculated the concentration of tea after replacing 15% of it with milk twice, and then calculated the concentration of tea after replacing 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. I double-checked my calculations to ensure accuracy. The final concentration of tea John drinks is 31.5%, which matches answer choice ""E"".","Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50% milk tea.
In step 1, 15% of the tea is replaced with milk. Thus, 85% of the original tea remains. Since this is done twice, we have a concentration of 50x0.85x0.85% (=36.125%) of tea solution.
Finally, 10% of this solution is replaced with milk again. So, the final concentration of tea is 36.125*0.9%
This equals 32.51% of tea solution.
