","Thought:
The original price of the computer can be found by working backwards from the final price paid, $p$.
First, we need to account for the 8 percent sales tax that was added to the discounted price.
To do this, we can divide $p$ by 1.08 (which represents 100% + 8%).
This will give us the discounted price of the computer before tax.
Next, we need to account for the 20 percent discount that was applied to the original price.
To do this, we can divide the discounted price by 0.8 (which represents 100% - 20%).
This will give us the original price of the computer.
Action: Answer(""D"")

Self-reflection:
Previously, I made a mistake in my calculation by not accounting for the sales tax correctly.
I realized that I needed to divide by 1.08 instead of subtracting 8%.
I also made sure to double-check my calculations to ensure accuracy.
In the future, I will be more careful when working with percentages and make sure to follow each step of the problem carefully.","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$. However, this is incorrect because $8 \%$ of the tax is over the discounted price, not the original one. The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them.

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 . Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41 .Choice $A$ is incorrect; the numbers 3 and 5 are possible values for $a$ and $b$, but not possible values for $c$.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.
