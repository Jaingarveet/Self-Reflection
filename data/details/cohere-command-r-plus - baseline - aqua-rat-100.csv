","Thought: 
Amy needs to create distinct codes for 10 different types of books using either a single letter or a pair of letters.

First, let's calculate the number of possible single letters:
- There are 26 choices for the first letter.

Now, let's calculate the number of possible pairs of two different letters:
- There are 26 choices for the first letter of the pair.
- There are 25 choices for the second letter of the pair (since it should be different from the first).
- The order of letters in a pair does not matter, so we divide by 2.
- So, there are 26 * 25 / 2 = 325 possible pairs.

Amy needs a total of 10 unique codes.

The smallest number of letters needed can be found by combining these options:
- She could use 10 single letters (A to J), but that would require more letters than necessary.
- She could use 1 single letter (A) and 9 letter pairs (AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ), which would require 1 + 2*9 = 20 letters.

So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need is 20.
Action: Answer(""E"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.
Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",E,D,0,345,287,632,

","Thought: 
Initially, the total number of members = 64 boys + 40 girls = 104 members.
Let's assume an equal number of boys and girls joined the group as x.
The ratio of boys to girls now is 4:3, so the number of boys to the total members is 4/7, and girls is 3/7.
This can be represented as:
(64 + x) / (40 + x) = 4/7
Simplifying this equation, we get:
3(64 + x) = 4(40 + x)
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x
3x - x = 160 - 192
2x = -32
x = 16
So, the number of new members that joined = 16.
Therefore, the total number of members now = 104 + 16 = 120.

Action: Answer(""C"")","Let us say x boys and x girls joined the group.
(64 + x)/(40 + x) = 4/3
192 + 3x = 160 + 4x => x = 32

This is a math problem that can be solved using a formula for time and work. 

Given that x men can do x units of work in x days, we can represent this as:

","Thought: 
If Alex and Jacob worked for almost the same number of hours, and Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, then he made approximately 35 / 2 = 17.5 toys.
This means Jacob, who takes 9 hours to make a toy, made approximately 17.5 toys as well.

Choice B, 16, is the closest to the calculated value of 17.5, so that is the best answer.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

","Thought: 
Let's denote the height of the tower as $h$ and the distance from the car to the base of the tower as $x$.
Using trigonometry, we can set up the following equations:
$\tan(45^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x} \implies x = h$
$\tan(60^{\circ}) = \frac{h}{x - 10}$

Setting these equations equal to each other and solving for $h$, we get:
$h = x = 5\sqrt{3}$

Now, we can find how much farther the car has to travel:
$x - 10 = 5\sqrt{3} - 10 = 5(\sqrt{3} - 2)$

Therefore, it will take $\mathbf{8(√3 - 2)}$ more minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

Action: Answer(""D"")","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Let X be the number of matches played by Sachin so far.
The total number of runs scored by Sachin after X matches = 51 * X
After the finals (X + 1) match, the total number of runs scored by Sachin = (51 * X) + 78
His batting average after the finals = (Total runs) / (X + 1)
Given that this average is 54.

So, we have:
(51X + 78) / (X + 1) = 54

","Thought: 
The hollow cube consists of 3 smaller cubes in each direction, resulting in a total of $3^3 = 27$ smaller cubes.
Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so there are a total of $27 \times 6 = 162$ faces.
Out of these, only the inner faces are not painted, which amounts to $5^3 = 125$ inner cube faces.
Thus, the number of unpainted faces is $162 - 125 = 37$.
Now, each smaller cube has one face that is part of the outer surface and thus painted, so the number of smaller cubes with unpainted faces is the same as the number of unpainted faces, i.e., 37.
Since each smaller cube has 5 unpainted faces (as one is painted), the total number of unpainted faces is $37 \times 5 = \boxed{185}$.

This question requires a calculation that doesn't align precisely with the provided choices. The closest answer would be to select the choice closest to 185, which is 180, half-way between 175 and 190.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

180 = ship's speed * Time
ship's speed = 20.

Now,
Distance traveled by the ship when they meet = Relative speed * Time

","Thought: 
Let's assume Arjun has $x dollars, and Sajal has $y dollars.

Given that if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice Arjun's remaining amount:
$y + $30 = 2($x - $30) 

Simplifying this equation, we get:
$y + $30 = $2x - $60
$y + $x = $2x - $30
$y = $x - $30

Now, we can use the second condition, where if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal:
$x + $10 = 3($y - $10)

Simplifying this equation, we find:
$x + $10 = 3$y - $30
$x - $y = $30

Using the value of $y from the first equation:
$x - ($x - $30) = $30
$30 = $30

So, Arjun has $x = $62, and using the first equation, we find Sajal has $y = $34.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Suppose Arun has $X and Sajal has $Y. then,
2(x-30)= y+30 => 2x-y =90 …(i)
and x +10 =3(y-10) => x-3y = - 40 …(ii)
Solving (i) and (ii), we get x =62 and y =34.
Arun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes
  E: 5 hour and 31 minutes
","Thought: 
First, we need to find the period of each ball.

For ball A, it completes one full rotation in 13 minutes, as 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes/rotation.
For ball B, it completes one full rotation in 7 minutes, as 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes/rotation.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two periods to determine when they will be at the same starting point again.

The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.

Therefore, it will take 91 minutes for the balls to return to their starting point simultaneously.

So, the answer is 1 hour and 31 minutes.
Action: Answer(""A"")","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

$1abcd = 1000 \times a + 100 \times b + 10 \times c + d$
$abcd1 = 3 \times (1000 \times a + 100 \times b + 10 \times c + d)$

The probability of the man catching the first train is the probability that he arrives during the 10-minute interval between trains.
Given the trains' frequencies, we know a new train arrives every 10 minutes.
So, the probability of catching the first train = 1/6, or 0.6.

","Thought: 
For the given range of n, we find the range of possible values for x.

Step 1: Simplify the expression for x:
= (n^2 + 2n + 8) / (n + 4)

Step 2: Find the range of values for the numerator and denominator separately:
Numerator (N): 
36^2 + 2*36*(36+4) + 16 = 1296 + 2880 + 16 = 4192
72^2 + 2*72*(72+4) + 16 = 5184 + 2160 + 16 = 7360
So, 4192 ≤ N ≤ 7360

Denominator (D): 
36 + 4*36^0.5 + 4 = 36 + 216^0.5 + 4 ≈ 36 + 64 + 4 = 104
72 + 4*72^0.5 + 4 = 72 + 288^0.5 + 4 ≈ 72 + 108 + 4 = 184
So, 104 ≤ D ≤ 184

Step 3: Now, find the range of values for x by dividing the ranges of N and D:
For the lower bound of x, divide the upper bound of D by the lower bound of N:
184/4192 ≤ x
≈ 0.0439 < x

For the upper bound of x, divide the lower bound of D by the upper bound of N:
104/7360 ≤ x
≈ 0.0141 < x

So, we've found that 0.0439 < x < infinity, which doesn't match any of the given ranges.

The key to this problem is understanding that the first quarter mile is more expensive than the subsequent quarter miles. Therefore, traveling further will be more efficient in terms of cost.

Let's calculate the cost for distances varying by one mile, starting from 1 mile and ending at 10 miles, with a step of 1 mile.
1 mile: $0.40
2 miles: $0.50
...
9 miles: $2.90
10 miles: $3.40

Since we have a budget of $8.50 for the ride, the maximum distance we can travel is 10 miles for $3.40, leaving us with a balance of $5.10 for the fare.
