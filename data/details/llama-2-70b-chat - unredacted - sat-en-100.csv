The authors of Passage 1 believe that women are suited for domestic duties and childrearing, and that this is their natural role. They argue that women have ""delicate constitutions,"" ""peaceful inclinations,"" and are suited for ""gentle occupations"" and ""the cares of the home."" They also suggest that this role is distinct from the roles performed by men, and that it is not appropriate for women to aspire to political rights and functions.

Therefore, option D is the best answer, as it most closely aligns with the authors' views. They do not suggest that running a household and raising children are rewarding for men as well as for women (option A), or that these roles yield less value for society than do the roles performed by men (option B). While the authors do suggest that women are suited for domestic duties, they do not imply that these duties are easy or without difficulty (option C).

The question that Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer is: ""Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?"" Maguire and her team wanted to find out if the brains of mental athletes were structurally different from those of the control subjects, or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess. They found that the brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects, but that they were engaging different circuitry when memorizing information. Specifically, they were using regions of the brain involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, such as the right posterior hippocampal region, which was also enlarged in London cabbies who had spent years navigating the city's streets. This suggests that the mental athletes' heightened memorization ability is the result of an unusual use of normal brain structure, rather than abnormal brain structure. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The purpose of Maguire's study of the mental athletes was to try to determine what it is that makes them so good at memorization, and in particular if they have structurally different brains than people without such extraordinary memorization skills or if they have normal brain structures but use them in unusual ways.

","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The main purpose of the passage is to explain research conducted to study why some birds fly in a V formation. The passage describes a study that used data loggers to track the flight patterns of northern bald ibises and found that the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies. The study suggests that birds fly in a V formation to save energy during flight, and the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because while the passage mentions that squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a V formation, this is not the main purpose of the passage.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage discusses the effects of downdrafts on birds and airplanes, this is not the main focus of the passage.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage includes the quotation ""Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing,"" the passage does not focus on how birds sense air currents through their feathers.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer.

The first paragraph continues by focusing on new research that might answer the question of why birds fly in that formation (""presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft - and save energy during flight""). As a whole, the passage can therefore be seen as a discussion of the biological motivation behind migrating birds' reliance on the $V$ formation.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the squadrons of planes mentioned in the second paragraph are used as an example to discuss migrating birds but are not themselves the main subject of this passage.

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the data in the table and incorrectly calculated the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens.

Error Keywords:
- Calculation error
- Data interpretation error
- Percentage calculation error

Solution:
The table shows that 100% of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by at least one of the four pathogens (Viruses, IAPV, KBV, and Fungi).

Furthermore, the table shows that 77% of colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by Nosema apis, and 100% were infected by either Nosema apis or Nosema ceranae (since 100% - 77% = 23%).

Therefore, the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens is:

100% (at least one of the four pathogens) x 77% (Nosema apis) x 100% (either Nosema apis or Nosema ceranae) = 100%

Instructions:
1. Read the table carefully and understand the data.
2. Calculate the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by at least one of the four pathogens.
3. Calculate the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by Nosema apis.
4. Calculate the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by either Nosema apis or Nosema ceranae.
5. Multiply the percentages from steps 2-4 to find the percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens.

Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beecher argues that women have a subordinate relationship to men in society, but this does not mean that their duties or influence are any less important. He states that women are designed to gain influence and exercise power differently than men, specifically through ""the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles"" and by making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved. Therefore, option B, ""Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men,"" is the best answer.

The passage develops a meaningful encounter between Chie and Akira, depicting the scene, characters' actions and reactions, and their dialogue.

The correct answer is D: An unexpected finding arises during the early phase of a study; the study is modified in response to this finding, and the results are interpreted and evaluated.

The passage describes how Ken Dial observed a pattern in how young ground birds ran along behind their parents and decided to conduct a study to investigate the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate. He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species and designed a project to measure the birds' first hops and flights. However, the local rancher advised him to give the birds something to climb on, as they preferred to rest on ledges or low branches rather than the ground. Ken brought in hay bales for the Chukars to perch on, and his son Terry fed and collected data on the birds.

Terry observed the baby Chukars using their legs to run up the side of the hay bales, flapping their wings all the while. Ken realized that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively and came up with a series of experiments to study this phenomenon. They found that the birds were using a technique called WAIR (wing-assisted incline running), which allowed them to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, as the study was modified in response to an unexpected finding, and the results were interpreted and evaluated.","Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial created an experiment to study the evolution of flight by observing how baby Chukars learn to fly.

","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The passage suggests that the US government's provisions for the institution of slavery, as framed in the Constitution, provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed. The author argues that the Constitution has allowed the US to grow and expand from four million to thirty million people, extend its territory from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean, and increase in population, wealth, and power. The author suggests that the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, if each state carries out the principles upon which their institutions were founded, such as the right of each state to do as it pleases without meddling with its neighbors. This implies that the Constitution's provisions for slavery were adequate for the time and did not need to be changed, which is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is incorrect because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",C,C,1,1739,204,1943,

Explanation:
The question is asking for evidence to support the idea that the base pairing in DNA is complementary, specifically that adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.

The table shows the percentage of each base in various organisms' DNA, including sea urchin DNA.

To find evidence in support of the answer to the previous question, we need to look for a pair of bases that have a high percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DNA.

The highest percentage of complementary base pairing in sea urchin DNA is between adenine and thymine, with 17.3% and 17.7% respectively. This suggests that adenine and thymine are paired together in sea urchin DNA, which supports the idea of complementary base pairing.

Therefore, the answer is A: $17.3 \%$ and $17.7 \%$.

Explanation:
The main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States in the first paragraph of Passage 1 is to suggest that the division into free and slave states does not endanger the Union. Douglas argues that the United States has grown rapidly in population, wealth, and power since its founding, and that this growth has occurred under a Constitution that Mr. Lincoln claims is contrary to the law of God and cannot stand. Douglas suggests that the fact that the Union has endured and expanded despite its division into free and slave states undermines Lincoln's argument that the Union cannot exist forever with this division.

Explanation:
The passage discusses how democracy can affect the inequality between men and women. The author believes that social changes that bring people closer to the same level will make women more equal to men. The author also mentions that the Americans understand that democratic equality between the sexes means giving each gender distinct employment based on their faculties. The author suggests that society has grown out of the state of inequality being its basis, and now tends to substitute a just equality as the general principle of human relations. Therefore, the authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles they describe are part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.

Although the authors generally disagree about the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and Mill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal shift toward equality in general.

  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.

","  Action: Answer(""A"")

The narrator is portrayed as someone who is reserved around unfamiliar people.

In the passage, the narrator is described as feeling shy and hesitant when interacting with her uncle, whom she has not seen in a long time. She also initially refuses his invitation to sit down, citing her father's busy schedule. These actions suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people, preferring to observe and take things in before engaging with others.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is attuned to her immediate surroundings (choice B). While she does notice some details about the shop, such as the polished wooden floors and the shiny glass cases, she does not seem to be particularly attuned to her surroundings or focused on observing them.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice A, reserved around unfamiliar people.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit.

  D: A large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
According to Hodick and Sievers' model, the Venus flytrap encodes and stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.

In choice B, the large insect makes contact with a second trigger hair after a period of inactivity during which calcium ion concentrations have diminished appreciably. This means that the calcium ion concentration in the trap has decreased over time, and it may not be high enough to close the trap even if a second hair is touched. Therefore, the Venus flytrap will not close around the insect in this scenario.

The other choices do not describe scenarios in which the Venus flytrap will not close around an insect. In choice A, the large insect's second contact with the plant's trigger hairs results in a total calcium ion concentration above the trap's threshold, which means the trap will close. In choice C, the large insect's contact with the plant's trigger hairs causes calcium channels to open in the trap, which is a necessary step for the trap to close. In choice D, the large insect's contact with a second trigger hair occurs within ten seconds of its contact with the first trigger hair, which is within the time frame required for the trap to close.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice B.

Reflection:
My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the mechanism by which the Venus flytrap closes. I thought that the trap would close as long as the total calcium ion concentration was above the threshold, regardless of how quickly the concentration increased. However, I now understand that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium ions to close, and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level. Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.

In choice B, the calcium ion concentration in the trap has decreased over time, and it may not be high enough to close the trap even if a second hair is touched. This means that the Venus flytrap will not close around the insect in this scenario, which is the correct answer.

I have learned to carefully consider the information provided in the question and to fully understand the mechanism by which the Venus flytrap closes before answering the question. I have also learned to reflect on my previous answers and to use my self-reflection to improve my understanding of the question and the correct answer.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. The fourth paragraph explains that the Venus flytrap will close only if a second hair is stimulated to ""push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap."" But the last sentence of the paragraph notes that the calcium concentrations ""dissipate over time,"" and if enough time elapses after the first trigger, ""the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap."" It can be inferred, then, that if a large insect didn't touch a second trigger hair until after the calcium ion concentrations had diminished appreciably, the Venus flytrap would fail to close. Choice $A$ is incorrect because the fourth paragraph makes clear that if the calcium concentration goes above the trap's threshold, the plant will close, not remain open. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because as the third paragraph explains, the touching of the trigger hair and opening of the calcium ion channels don't act to keep the trap open but are instead a precondition for the closing of the trap (though closing will occur only if a second trigger hair is touched). Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence of the fifth paragraph explains that the threshold for the time that can elapse between the touching of the first and second trigger hairs is twenty seconds, meaning that a large insect touching two hairs within ten seconds would almost certainly make the plant close.",B,B,1,1804,607,2411,

The passage highlights the transformative effect of Eppie's presence on Silas' life, emphasizing how her innocence, joy, and curiosity reawaken his senses, stir his heart, and gradually bring him out of his lonely, stifling existence. The narrative underscores the redemptive power of parental love and the ways in which it can revive a person's spirit, awaken dormant emotions, and create new connections. Therefore, option D, ""The restorative power of parental love,"" best captures a major theme of the passage.","Choice $D$ is the best answer. The final sentence of the first paragraph makes clear that before adopting his daughter, the weaver Silas was greedy for gold and chained to his work, ""deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom."" But after adopting Eppie, Silas became more interested in life outside his job: ""Eppie called him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life."" A major theme of the passage can be seen in this transformation, as it represents how loving a child can improve or change a parent's life.Choice A is incorrect because even if the passage implies that Silas was too materialistic before his daughter's arrival in his life, his greediness was a personal characteristic only, not a societal one; whether the society Silas lives in is overly materialistic is never addressed. Choice B is incorrect because even if the passage represents the ""moral purity"" of children, it does so only indirectly and not as a major theme.

The author of Passage 2, Mary Wollstonecraft, argues that women are excluded from political rights and functions, and that this exclusion is unjust and inconsistent with the principles of reason and happiness. She claims that men have usurped the throne of reason and tyrannize over women, denying them civil and political rights and forcing them to remain immured in their families.

* ""subjugate women""
* ""denying them civil and political rights""
* ""tyrants of every denomination""
* ""usurp reason's throne""
* ""force all women to remain immured in their families""

","  Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The 1993 experiment conducted by Olausson and his colleagues showed that gentle pressure on the arm prompted two different signals, one immediate and one delayed. The delay in the signal identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers. This means that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers, which supports conclusion C.

The other choices are not supported by the findings of the experiment:

A: The experiment did not test the speed of sensation at bodily extremities versus stimulation closer to the brain.

B: The presence of hairs in human skin did not affect the speed of nerve conduction.

D: The experiment did not test the relationship between the strength of pressure applied to the nerve and the speed at which the nerve fires.

Therefore, the best conclusion supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is conclusion C: Gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. According to the passage, different types of nerve fibers carry signals at different speeds, either fast or slow. The second paragraph outlines a study led by Håkan Olausson in 1993 that measured the response time of nerves when exposed to gentle pressure. Olausson and his team found that ""soft stroking prompted two different signals"" in test subjects' nerve fibers, ""one immediate and one delayed."" Therefore, the conclusion that is best supported by the findings of Olausson's 1993 experiment is that gentle pressure is sensed not only by fast fibers but also by slow fibers.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because according to the passage, Olausson's 1993 study didn't compare how signal speed was affected by stimulation in different bodily areas (choice (A)or by different amounts of pressure applied to the nerve (choice D).

This interaction leads the narrator to conclude in the last paragraph, ""I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way."" Therefore, the passage is best summarized as a character's visit to her family's ink shop that deepens her appreciation of her family's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator's arrival at her family's ink shop does spark memories of her Precious Auntie, these memories center on Precious Auntie's beliefs about creativity, including the conviction that inferior ink produces inferior thought. The narrator's thoughts on Precious Auntie occur in the fourth paragraph, so choice A isn't the best summary of the overall passage. Choice B is incorrect. Although the passage describes the narrator's surprise visit to the ink shop and a reunion with her uncles, these events occur in the first paragraph. Therefore, choice B doesn't provide the best summary of the passage as a whole.

Explanation:
The passage highlights the importance of quality and deliberate effort in the production of inksticks. The author's father and uncles are described as taking great care in the creation of their inksticks, and the author is proud to hear her father speak of their family's ink in a way that emphasizes its high quality. The passage also mentions Precious Auntie's teachings that good ink cannot be quick or easy to produce, and that the process of pushing an inkstick along an inkstone is a way of cleansing one's mind and heart. These elements suggest that a main theme of the passage is the importance of deliberate effort and quality in creative endeavors. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Reflection:
I incorrectly answered the question the first time because I was not paying close attention to the themes presented in the passage. Upon reflection, I realized that the passage emphasizes the importance of deliberate effort and quality in the production of inksticks, which aligns with option B. I also considered option A, but while family relationships are mentioned in the passage, they are not a main theme. Option C is not a main theme of the passage, as the focus is on the quality of the inksticks rather than their monetary value. Option D is not mentioned in the passage at all.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the fourth paragraph, the narrator recounts her Precious Auntie's belief that ""you can never be an artist if your work comes without effort."" Her Precious Auntie states that when the physical act of writing is done with an ""inkstick along an inkstone,"" this process requires an artist to ""take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?"" In the following paragraphs, the narrator recalls the pride she felt while listening to her father describe the high quality of the ink that her family had worked hard to produce. Therefore, a main theme of the passage is that quality is achieved through deliberate effort. Choice A is incorrect. Although family relationships form a backdrop to the passage, the nurturing of these relationships isn't a main theme. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. Although the passage does emphasize that hard work produces higher quality writing than that which is produced through minimal work, the passage doesn't mention that hard work results in material compensation. Choice D is incorrect. Although the passage discusses the role of concentrated effort in creative expression, a main theme of the passage isn't that creativity needs to be expressed concretely.",B,B,1,1561,308,1869,

The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters behaves as if he is a younger version of himself. The paragraph describes his efforts to present himself as still young and powerful, such as straightening his tie self-consciously and flashing his diamond ring at the women at the next table. This suggests that he is trying to act younger than he actually is, and is therefore behaving as if he is a younger version of himself.

Error Keywords:

* Neglects
* Preoccupied

The passage does not mention Mr. Peters neglecting his family members or being preoccupied with the knowledge that he is growing old. While it does mention his graying hair and lost weight, which may suggest that he is growing older, the main focus of the paragraph is on his efforts to present himself as still young and powerful.

Explanation:
The passage suggests that Silas' adoption of Eppie has led him to look forward to a different kind of future. Before Eppie came into his life, Silas was described as being trapped in a ""cold, narrow prison"" of his own thoughts and obsessed with his gold. In contrast, Eppie represents new life, hope, and change, and her presence has awakened Silas to the world around him. Now, he looks forward to the future with anticipation, eager to see what Eppie will learn and do next. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

By influencing Silas to think ""onward"" and of ""the coming years,"" Eppie prompts Silas to envision a far different future than he would experience otherwise.Choice $A$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that Silas is less obsessed with money than before, there is no indication that he has actually renounced his desire for it.

I incorrectly assumed that Passage 2 was illustrating the practical difficulties of a proposal made in Passage 1, when in fact, Passage 2 was directly challenging the argument presented in Passage 1.
I have since re-read the passages and realized that option B is the correct answer, as Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.

Action: Answer(B)

Explanation:
Passage 1 presents a view on the role of women in society, arguing that women should conform to a subordinate position and exert influence through peaceful and benevolent means. Passage 2, written by Grimké, takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1, arguing that women have equal rights and responsibilities as moral beings. Grimké's argument directly challenges the idea that women should be subordinate to men, and instead advocates for their equal status and opportunities. Therefore, option B is the best answer, as Passage 2 takes issue with the primary argument of Passage 1.","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have different positions in society: ""Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station"" (lines 1-2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to influence men but should not ""exert coercive influences"" that would put her ""out of her appropriate sphere"" (lines 44-46). In Passage 2, Grimké takes issue with the idea that men and women have different rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and states that ""the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman"" (lines 66-68).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is proposed in Passage 1 but rather argues against the main point of Passage 1 . Choice $C$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society.

","  Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

Explanation:
The authors of both passages would most likely agree with statement D: They generally enjoyed fewer rights than men did.

In Passage 1, the author argues that women are excluded from public employments and political rights, and that this exclusion is justified because it leads to a greater sum of mutual happiness for both sexes. The author also suggests that women are not suited for strenuous habits and onerous duties and are instead summoned to gentle occupations and the cares of the home.

In Passage 2, the author argues that women need education to become the companion of man and to understand their duty and the true principle of patriotism. The author also suggests that the education and situation of women shut them out from investigations into the moral and civil interest of mankind.

Both passages suggest that women in the eighteenth century had fewer rights and opportunities than men, and that this was seen as a natural and just state of affairs. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer. The authors of Passage 1 admit that women are ""excluded by the other half [men] from any participation in government"" (lines 1-2), and Wollstonecraft states that society's male leaders create laws that deny women ""civil and political rights"" (line 86).Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the authors of both passages would not agree that women had the same preferences as men, required a good education, or were as happy as men.",D,D,1,1648,235,1883,

Explanation:
In Passage 1, Beecher implies that women's effect on public life is largely indirect because women exert their influence within the home and family life. Beecher argues that women are designed to have a subordinate relation in society to men, but this does not mean that their duties or influence should be any less important. Instead, women are to win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved, and thus exerting their influence in the domestic and social circle.

These lines show that Beecher believes women can influence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect influence on public life.

Explanation:
The passage describes Eppie's impact on Silas, stating that she ""stirred Silas' heart"" and ""unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness."" This suggests that Eppie's expanding awareness and engagement with the world are connected to Silas's increasing engagement with life, supporting choice B.

* Insatiable desire for wealth (choice C) is not mentioned in the passage as a characteristic of Silas.

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I mistakenly chose choice A, physical vulnerability, as the connection between Eppie and Silas. However, upon reflection, I realized that the passage does not mention physical vulnerability as a connection between the two. Instead, it emphasizes Eppie's expanding awareness and engagement with the world, and how this affects Silas's increasing engagement with life. Therefore, the correct answer is choice B, expanding awareness and Silas's increasing engagement with life.","Choice B is the best answer.

As Eppie grows into a world that is new to her, Silas recovers a world he'd largely forgotten.

Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The passage begins by describing the Alcazar Restaurant and its patrons, including Lymie, who is reading a book while eating. The focus then shifts to Lymie's experience reading about the Peace of Paris and the Congress of Vienna, with the text providing details about the historical events and the marginal notes in the book. The focus then shifts again to the people in the restaurant, particularly a group of four who enter and take a table near Lymie. The passage ends with Mr. Peters, Lymie's father, entering the restaurant and joining Lymie at his table.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Lymie's experience reading a book to descriptions of people in the restaurant. The primary focus of the passage shifts from Lymie's inner thoughts and experience reading about historical events to descriptions of the people and atmosphere in the restaurant.","Choice D is the best answer. The passage begins with the main character, Lymie, sitting in a restaurant and reading a history book. The first paragraph describes the book in front of him (""Blank pages front and back were filled in with maps, drawings, dates, comic cartoons, and organs of the body,"" lines 1113).

In the third paragraph, the focus of the passage shifts to a description and discussion of others in the restaurant, namely ""A party of four, two men and two women...""

In Passage 1, Beveridge describes the United States as ""a land set like a sentinel between the two imperial oceans of the globe"" and notes that it is ""a greater England with a nobler destiny."" He also emphasizes that the United States has been ""planted on this soil"" by God and that it is ""a people imperial by virtue of their power, by right of their institutions, by authority of their heaven-directed purposes."" These statements suggest that Beveridge views the resources and immensity of the United States as a divine gift to the American people, rather than a safeguard against foreign invasion (choice A), a replication of conditions in Europe (choice B), or a source of envy for people in other countries (choice D). Therefore, the best answer is choice C.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge portrays America as ""a noble land that God has given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a land whose coast lines would enclose half the countries of Europe."" Thus, in Passage 1, Beveridge asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift to the American people.Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because Beveridge envisions Americans occupying foreign lands, not being subject to foreign invasion; moreover, he asserts that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a divine gift, not a safeguard against invasion.Choice B is incorrect because Beveridge asserts that American society constitutes an improvement on English society, not that the resources and immensity of the United States replicate conditions in Europe. Choice D is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't assert that the resources and immensity of the United States constitute a source of envy for people in other countries.",C,C,1,1588,354,1942,

The passage states that Sempere is a bookseller who allows the protagonist to read books in his shop and sometimes gives him books for free. It also mentions that Sempere knows some authors who frequent his establishment, and that he handles an old volume of ""Great Expectations"" by Charles Dickens with care. However, there is no indication that Sempere models his own writing after Dickens's style (choice A), feels a personal connection to details of Dickens's biography (choice C), or considers himself to be Dickens's most appreciative reader (choice D).

  D: tale about the hardships of the narrator's childhood to an analysis of the effects of those hardships.
","  Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation:
The passage begins by discussing the narrator's love of reading and how it served as a refuge from their troubled home life. It then shifts to a specific incident where the narrator's father discovers their reading habit and tears a book from their hands, throwing it out the window. Following this, the narrator describes their favorite bookshop and how the bookseller there allows them to read books for free and even gifts them a volume of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations."" The passage culminates in the narrator expressing their desire to learn to write like Dickens.

Therefore, the main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading (option A) to a portrayal of an influential incident where the narrator receives a meaningful gift from the bookseller (option A).

Answer: A","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't make the narrator's childhood hardships its central focus or analyze the effects of those hardships.",A,A,1,1515,203,1718,

I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question. I thought the question was asking about the resources that are valuable on Earth, rather than the resources that will be highly valued in space. I also didn't consider the information in Passage 2, which explicitly states that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be different from those we prize on Earth.

Action: Answer(A)

Explanation:
The correct answer is A: They may be different resources from those that are valuable on Earth.

In Passage 1, the author mentions that the resources extracted from space will be used to meet earthly demands for precious metals and rare earth elements. However, the passage also mentions that water ice from the moon's poles could be sent to astronauts on the International Space Station for drinking or as a radiation shield, and that splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen makes spacecraft fuel. This implies that resources that are not necessarily valuable on Earth, such as water, may be highly valued in space.

In Passage 2, the author explicitly states that the resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth. This reinforces the idea that resources that are not valuable on Earth may be highly valued in space.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet. Passage 2 says this explicitly in lines 74-76: ""The resources that are valuable in orbit and beyond may be very different to those we prize on Earth."" Meanwhile Passage 1 suggests that water mined from space may be more valuable than metals or other earth elements when creating an ""off-plant economy"" lines 25-30).Choice B is incorrect because neither passage discusses, either implicitly or explicitly, the need for space mining to be inexpensive. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Passage 2 does not specifically identify precious metals or rare earth elements but instead focuses on theoretical problems with space mining. Choice D is incorrect because diminishing resources on Earth is not discussed in Passage 2.",,A,0,1704,297,2001,

  D: Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The passage states that Volkov tested Hodick and Sievers' model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the Venus flytrap. However, the passage also states that Hodick and Sievers proposed that the flytrap stored information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf. Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers' model, as he applied an electrical current directly to the trap, rather than measuring the electric charge of the leaf. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's understanding of Hodick and Sievers' model was incorrect.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's direct application of an electrical current.

Option D is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that Volkov's technology was not available to Hodick and Sievers.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is impossible to know from the passage if Hodick and Sievers would have objected to Volkov's methods.

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

The correct answer is B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.

The narrator is described as paying close attention to her surroundings, noticing details such as the polished wooden floors, the shiny glass cases, and the different qualities of inksticks. She is also described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention in creating art. These details suggest that the narrator is someone who is attuned to her surroundings and values attention to detail.

There is no evidence in the passage to suggest that the narrator is reserved around unfamiliar people (choice A). While she is initially hesitant to approach her uncle, she quickly warms up to him and engages in conversation.

There is also no evidence to suggest that the narrator is sympathetic to the needs of others (choice C). While she is polite and respectful to her uncle and father, there is no indication that she is particularly sympathetic or empathetic towards them.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the narrator is anxious about her responsibilities (choice D). While she is described as remembering her aunt's teachings about the importance of effort and intention, there is no indication that she is anxious or stressed about her responsibilities.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.","Choice $B$ is the best answer. In the first sentence of the second paragraph, the narrator states: ""I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen."" She then proceeds to describe the floors of the family's ink shop, the walls and display cases, and the various items for sale. According to the third paragraph, these include an inkstick ""with a top shaped like a fairy boat,"" another inkstick with ""a bird shape,"" and a collection of ink cakes ""embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo."" Therefore, throughout the passage, the narrator is portrayed as someone who is attuned to her immediate surroundings.Choice A is incorrect. Although the narrator describes herself as shy, the people she interacts with aren't unfamiliar to her because they are members of her family whom she has met before. Choices $\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because the narrator isn't portrayed as sympathetic to the needs of others (choice (C)or anxious about her responsibilities (choice D).",B,B,1,1707,318,2025,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting (D) idealism that permeates many aspects of American society.

I mistakenly assumed that Bryan's reference to the Declaration of Independence and Patrick Henry's speech were indicative of idealism.
However, both passages primarily focus on the founding and history of the United States.
Therefore, I have revised my answer to (A) founding and history of the United States.

Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation:

Both Beveridge and Bryan express admiration for the founding and history of the United States in their speeches.
Beveridge references the ""glorious history"" of the United States and its ""heaven-directed purposes,"" while Bryan quotes Patrick Henry's famous statement ""Give me liberty or give me death"" and references the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
Neither speech focuses on the vibrancy and diversity of American culture (B), the worldwide history of struggles for independence (C), or the idealism that permeates many aspects of American society (D).
Therefore, the correct answer is (A) founding and history of the United States.","Choice $\mathbf{A}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge references the founding and history of the United States as ""a glorious history"" that was bestowed upon God's ""chosen people,"" a history heroic with faith in its mission and future, and ""statesmen, who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored lands."" Similarly, in the second paragraph of Passage 2, Bryan declares, ""Our whole history has been an encouragement .. . to all who are denied a voice in their own government."" Bryan goes on to extol the virtues of several figures who were instrumental in the founding of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Hence, in developing their respective arguments, Beveridge (Passage 1) and Bryan (Passage 2) both express admiration for the founding and history of the United States.Choice B is incorrect because neither Bryan, in Passage 1, nor Beveridge, in Passage 2, expresses admiration for the vibrancy and diversity of American culture. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Bryan expresses admiration for the worldwide history of struggles for independence, but Beveridge doesn't.

","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The passage implies that pelicans, storks, and geese, like ibises, fly in a V formation, as the author states that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds. However, the author does not mention anything about their communication methods, migration routes, or energy expenditure, so options A, B, and D are not implied by the passage. Therefore, the best answer is C, as the passage suggests that these birds create a similar wake to that of ibises, which allows them to fly efficiently in a V formation.

Error Keywords:

- Communication methods
- Migration routes
- Energy expenditure

Solution:

1. Identify the topic of the passage, which is English.
2. Understand the question, which asks about the author's implication regarding pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation.
3. Read the passage carefully and identify the relevant information, which suggests that the findings likely apply to other long-winged birds.
4. Eliminate options A, B, and D, as they are not implied by the passage.
5. Choose option C, as it is the best answer based on the information provided in the passage.

In these lines the author therefore implies that unlike smaller birds, pelicans, storks, and geese flying in a V formation likely create a similar wake to that of ibises.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage focuses entirely on bird flight, not bird communication.

Lincoln's argument in Passage 2 suggests that the controversy over slavery is caused by efforts to spread it into new territory, and that limiting it to its present bounds would lead to peace. Therefore, he would likely agree that abandoning attempts to introduce slavery to regions where it is not practiced would abate the controversy.

However, upon reflection, I realized that Lincoln's argument in Passage 2 focuses on the idea that the controversy over slavery is caused by efforts to spread it into new territory, and that limiting it to its present bounds would lead to peace. Therefore, the correct answer is B, as it aligns with Lincoln's argument.

In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy surrounding slavery in the United States has died down whenever the institution of slavery has been restricted geographically: ""Whenever it has been limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to spread it, there has been peace."" Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery.

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The passage states that the Venus flytrap needs to conserve its energy supply, as closing its trap requires a significant amount of energy and reopening it can take several hours. The plant achieves this by requiring multiple triggers (the touch of two hairs) to spring the trap closed, which ensures that it only closes when a large enough insect is present, making it worth the energy expenditure. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about the plant identifying the species of its prey.

Option B is incorrect because while calcium is involved in the mechanism of the Venus flytrap's closure, the passage does not suggest that the plant's calcium reserves are a concern.

Option D is incorrect because while the plant does need to wait for a second trigger before closing, this is not done to prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey, but rather to ensure that it only closes when a large enough insect is present.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",C,C,1,1611,234,1845,

Action: Answer(""D"")

The correct answer is D: analyze a reaction. The first paragraph describes Chie's reaction to Akira's unexpected proposal and her thoughts about the situation. It also shows her daughter Naomi's reaction and her opinion on the matter, which helps to analyze the reactions of both Chie and Naomi. Therefore, option D is the best answer.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole.

  D: Beveridge regards it as a model that should be shared with other countries, whereas Bryan believes that it is unique to the United States and could not work elsewhere.
","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:

In Passage 1, Beveridge presents liberty as a noble ideal that has been bestowed upon the United States by God and emphasizes the country's destiny to spread this liberty to other regions through imperial expansion. On the other hand, in Passage 2, Bryan argues that the principles of self-government and popular sovereignty, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, should not be repudiated in the Philippines or elsewhere. Bryan sees liberty as a fundamental right that all people possess and warns against the negative consequences of imperialism on both the colonized people and the United States itself.

Therefore, option B is the best choice, as it accurately describes the central difference between Beveridge and Bryan's views on liberty. Beveridge sees liberty as something that can be exported through conquest, while Bryan sees it as a fundamental right that should not be compromised through imperial expansion.

4. Practice active reading and critical thinking to improve your comprehension of complex texts.","Choice B is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Beveridge argues that Americans are ""imperial by virtue of their power"" and are therefore justified in being ""the propagandists ... of liberty."" In the second paragraph, he extols the benefits that will arise from American administration of various island nations. Meanwhile, in the last sentence of Passage 2, Bryan cautions, ""We cannot repudiate the principle of self-government in the Philippines without weakening that principle here""; in other words, imperial expansion by the United States would erode a key American value. Therefore, the difference between how the speakers view liberty as it is realized in the United States is that Beveridge considers it so exemplary as to justify the conquest of other regions, whereas Bryan warns that its exemplary quality would be undermined by imperial expansion.Choice A is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't present the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as the direct inheritance of European colonization. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Beveridge doesn't argue that the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States arose organically as the country matured; instead, both Beveridge and Bryan emphasize the divinely inspired, intrinsic nature of the American concept of liberty. Choice D is incorrect because Bryan views the concept of liberty as it's realized in the United States as encompassing a desire for self-rule and argues that this desire is universal and not unique to the United States.",B,B,1,1913,393,2306,
