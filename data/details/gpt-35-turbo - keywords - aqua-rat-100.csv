","Thought:
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The space diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the formula sqrt(l^2 + w^2 + h^2), where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height of the rectangular solid, respectively.
Substituting the given values, we get sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225) = sqrt(250).
Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is sqrt(250) x 2 = 5 x sqrt(10) [approximately 15.8113].
Action: Answer(""B"")","In an inscribed rectangle in a sphere, we will have a line joining the opposite vertices as the diameter.
According to the Pythagoras theorem, sides 3, 4 give diagonal as 5 ==> with 5 and 15, we get 5sqrt(10).
5sqrt(10) or 15.8113 is the diameter of the sphere.

","Thought:
Let x be the length of the original square piece of cloth.
The area of the original square piece of cloth is x^2.
After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x.
The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
The area of a triangle is (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height.
Let y be the height of each triangle.
Then, (1/2)(x-4)y = 70, so y = 140/(x-4).
The base of each triangle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs x-4 and y.
By the Pythagorean theorem, (x-4)^2 + y^2 = x^2.
Substituting y = 140/(x-4), we get (x-4)^2 + (140/(x-4))^2 = x^2.
Expanding and simplifying, we get x^4 - 8x^3 + 2320x - 62720 = 0.
We can solve this equation using synthetic division or a graphing calculator to get x = 32 or x = 70.

Mr.Brown's rate of work = 1/6
Mr.Black's rate of work = 1/8
Mr.Blue's rate of work = 1/12
The combined rate of work of all three painters = 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 6/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 11/24
In 8 days, the work done by all three painters = 8 * 11/24 = 11/3
After 8 days, only Mr. Black is working. In 6 days, Mr. Black will complete = 6 * 1/8 = 3/4 of the work.
The total work done = 11/3 + 3/4 = 44/12 + 9/12 = 53/12
The remaining work = 1 - 53/12 = 11/12

Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)

The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm, so the inner cube has a size of 3cm.
The outer surface area of the hollow cube is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150 cm^2.
The number of smaller cubes on the outer surface is (5x5x6) - (3x3x6) = 150.
Each smaller cube has 6 faces, and only the inner faces are unpainted.
The number of unpainted faces is 150 x 4 = 600.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces

Let's first calculate the number of black marbles pulled out the second time. If one out of 20 marbles is black, then the percentage of black marbles is 5%. If this represents the percentage of black marbles in the bag, then the number of black marbles in the bag is 5% of the total number of marbles. Let's call the total number of marbles Q. Therefore, the number of black marbles in the bag is 0.05Q. We know that 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag and then returned, so the number of marbles in the bag did not change. Therefore, the number of black marbles in the bag after the second set of pulls is 0.05Q, and the number of white marbles is 0.95Q. We also know that 1 black marble was pulled out of the second set of 20 marbles. Therefore, the total number of black marbles in the bag is 0.05Q + 1, and the total number of marbles in the bag is 0.05Q + 0.95Q = Q. We can set up an equation to solve for Q:

Let's call the distance between A and B ""d"".
Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B ""t1"".
Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from B to A ""t2"".
We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, and at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A.
We also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
This means that at that point, he had already traveled a distance of d - 70 miles.
We can use the formula distance = rate x time to create two equations:
d = 70t1 + 90t2
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
We can use substitution to solve for t1 in terms of t2:
70t1 = d - 90t2
t1 = (d - 90t2) / 70
We can substitute this expression for t1 into the first equation:
d = 70[(d - 90t2) / 70] + 90t2
Simplifying this equation, we get:
d = d - 90t2 + 90t2
d = d
This equation is true for any value of d, which means that we can't solve for d using these equations alone.
However, we can use the second equation to solve for t2:
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
d - 70 = 90t2 - 270
d = 90t2 - 200
We can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:
90t2 - 200 = 70t1 + 90t2
20t2 = 70t1 + 200
t2 = (7/2)t1 + 10
We can substitute this expression for t2 into the second equation:
d - 70 = 90(t2 - 3)
d - 70 = 90[((7/2)t1 + 10) - 3]
d - 70 = 315/2t1 + 630
d = 315/2t1 + 700
We can substitute this expression for d into the first equation:
d = 70t1 + 90t2
315/2t1 + 700 = 70t1 + 90[((7/2)t1 + 10)]
315t1 + 140000 = 980t1 + 6300
665t1 = 133700
t1 = 201
We can substitute this value of t1 into the expression we derived for t2:
t2 = (7/2)t1 + 10
t2 = (7/2)(201) + 10
t2 = 715/2
Now we can substitute these values of t1 and t2 into the expression we derived for d:

d = 70(201) + 90(715/2)

","Self-Reflection:
The two trains have a frequency of 10 minutes, which means that they arrive every 10 minutes. The main line starts at 5 o'clock, and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. The man wants to catch the first train that comes. 
To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to find the time interval between the first train's arrival and the time the man arrives at the station. 
Let's assume that the man arrives at the station at a random time between 5.00 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. 
If the man arrives between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M., he will catch the harbor line train. 
If the man arrives between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M., he will catch the main line train. 
Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability of him arriving between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. (for the harbor line train) plus the probability of him arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. (for the main line train). 
The time interval between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. is 2 minutes. The time interval between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. is 8 minutes. 
The probability of the man arriving between 5.00 A.M. and 5.02 A.M. is 2/10 or 0.2. 
The probability of the man arriving between 5.02 A.M. and 5.10 A.M. is 8/10 or 0.8. 
Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 0.2 + 0.8 = 1. 
Action: Answer(""E"")","For each 10 min interval, if man comes in first 2 min, he'll catch the 1st train, if he comes in next 8 min, he'll catch the 2nd train.

To find the least possible number of students in the school, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies both conditions. 
Let's assume that there are 501 students in the school. 
Then, the number of students who took physics is 20% of 501 = 100.2 (which is not possible as it should be a whole number). 
Similarly, the number of students who took math is 28% of 501 = 140.28 (which is also not possible). 
Therefore, the minimum number of students in the school should be more than 501. 
To find the least possible number of students, we can assume that all the students who took physics also took math. 
Then, the number of students who took math or physics = 20% + (28%-20%) = 24%. 
So, 24% of the total number of students should be more than 501. 
Let x be the total number of students in the school.
