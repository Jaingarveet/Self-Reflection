The correct answer is C, as it is the only option that involves the imposition of Western values or methods onto a non-Western culture. The study employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, which would be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.

The other options do not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures and therefore would not be considered objectionable by proponents of this version of multicultural education:

A: A study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a comparative study that aims to understand the differences between various moral codes.

B: A study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study of the culture's own values and beliefs.

D: A study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values would not necessarily involve the imposition of Western values or methods onto non-Western cultures, as it would be a study that aims to understand and critique the literature of a particular society using the values and beliefs of that society.

Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The correct answer is E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.

The passage argues that increased specialization leads to increased productivity, but it also suggests that there are limits to this specialization. If specialization leads to higher training costs and increased turnover, then it's possible that the benefits of increased specialization may be offset by these costs. This means that there may be a point where further specialization does not lead to increased productivity, and therefore, increased size may not necessarily lead to monopoly power.

My previous answer was incorrect because I misunderstood the question. I chose choice A, thinking that it was the best answer, but upon re-reading the passage, I realized that it does not support that choice. The passage does not mention anything about Marshall's ideological motivations changing during his tenure on the U.S. Supreme Court.

The correct answer is choice B, which states that Marshall declined to pursue some cases that were in keeping with the NAACP's goals but whose plaintiffs' likely impression on the public he deemed to be unfavorable. The passage supports this choice by stating that Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed. This implies that Marshall declined to pursue cases with plaintiffs who did not meet these criteria, even if the cases were in keeping with the NAACP's goals.

He rejected the radical view that art should serve a particular political view and the realist view that art should depict reality ""as it is.""

I thought the passage was discussing the criticism of evolutionary psychology, but it was actually explaining how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.
I also realized that I should have paid closer attention to the language used in the options, particularly the phrase ""most accurately states"" in the question.

Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
Passage A explains how evolutionary psychology can account for altruistic behavior, which seems to be problematic for a theory that emphasizes individual reproductive success. The passage suggests that altruistic behavior can be understood as a result of psychological experiences of identification and empathy, which were initially aroused by cues of kinship or familiarity and increased the chances of related individuals receiving assistance. This would enhance the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy, thereby promoting the propagation of genetic material. Therefore, option E accurately states the main point of passage A.

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that altruistic behavior diminishes the reproductive success of individuals that exhibit it. Instead, it explains how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Option B is incorrect because while the passage mentions new evidence that may explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, it does not state that this evidence shows that genes promote their own self-propagation.

Option C is incorrect because while the passage mentions that humans no longer live in small, kin-based groups, it does not suggest that altruistic behavior originally served evolutionary purposes that it does not serve today.

Option D is incorrect because while the passage mentions that critics of evolutionary psychology argue that most significant types of human behavior are not prompted by genetically selfish motivations, it does not take a position on this issue. Instead, it focuses on explaining how altruistic behavior can be understood as serving evolutionary purposes.

Explanation:
The passage discusses the potential health benefits of moderate wine consumption, specifically citing the presence of natural compounds found in grapes that may contribute to these benefits.

Explanation:
The principle that underlies both passages is that fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards if fingerprint identification is to be reliable. Passage A argues that while there may be some issues with the reliability of fingerprint identification, it has been used for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability. However, it also notes that there are no established error rates revealing how often fingerprint examiners incorrectly identify a fingerprint as a particular person's, and that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards.

I previously answered this question incorrectly.
I mistakenly chose option A, which is not supported by the passage.
I should have read the passage more carefully and noticed that it does not mention recent natural mutations in plants.
I should have chosen option B, which is the correct answer.

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The passage suggests that secondary substances in plants typically contribute to a plant's taste or smell, but not both. The passage states, ""The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism."" It also states, ""Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms."" Additionally, it states, ""Still, other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful.""

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

Option A is incorrect because the passage does not mention recent natural mutations in plants.

Option C is incorrect because the passage does not mention any chemical reactions between secondary substances in plants and substances produced by insects.

Option D is incorrect because the passage states that only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family.

Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anything about secondary substances acting as regulators of plants' growth or metabolism.

However, upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is (D) ""discretionary"", since both words relate to the idea of exercising choice or discretion in decision-making.

Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The word ""selectively"" in Passage B is most closely related to the word ""discretionary"" in Passage A. In Passage B, ""selectively"" is used to describe the plan to cut off water to a few residences with outstanding bills, implying that the choice of which residences to target is left to the discretion of the officials. Similarly, in Passage A, ""discretionary"" refers to the power of law enforcement agencies to exercise their discretion in deciding which cases to pursue, rather than being strictly bound by the letter of the law.

I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question and chose an answer that was not supported by the passage. I mistakenly chose choice A, thinking that it was the correct answer because it was mentioned in passage A as a characteristic of human ancestors that may have influenced the evolution of altruistic mechanisms. However, passage B does not criticize this explanation as questionable.

Upon reflection, I realized that the question asks for an example of a human characteristic for which evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation. Passage B discusses the questionable explanation for monogamous families, which is not supported by conclusive evidence. Therefore, the correct answer is choice C.

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
According to passage B, evolutionary psychologists propose a questionable explanation for the human characteristic of forming monogamous families. The passage states that evolutionary psychologists argue that an interest in propagating genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly, and that this same interest could explain why humans form monogamous families. However, the passage suggests that this explanation is not decisive and that there may be other interests that could equally explain this behavior. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

The other choices are not mentioned as questionable explanations in passage B. Choice A is mentioned as a characteristic of human ancestors that may have influenced the evolution of altruistic mechanisms, but it is not criticized as a questionable explanation. Choice B is mentioned as a factor that may have influenced the evolution of monogamous families, but it is not suggested to be a questionable explanation. Choice E is mentioned as a possible interest that could explain human behavior, but it is not related to the criticism of evolutionary psychology in passage B.",,C,C,1,1411,399,1810,

  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","  Action: Answer(E)

The author's attitude toward the twofold obligation introduced in lines 20-23 is best described as convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers. The author argues that defense lawyers have an obligation to both their clients and the court, and that this twofold obligation allows them to balance these responsibilities. The author does not suggest that this obligation represents a conflict of interest for defense lawyers, but rather a necessary balance that must be struck in order to provide the best defense possible while also upholding their duty to the court and society. Therefore, option E is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation enables defense lawyers to balance their competing responsibilities to the court and to society. While the author does argue that defense lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, they also acknowledge that this duty must be balanced with their obligation to the court and society.

Option B is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation prevents defense lawyers from representing clients whom they know to be guilty. Instead, the author argues that defense lawyers should not present assertions that they know to be false to the court, but they should still represent their clients to the best of their ability.

Option C is also incorrect because while the author mentions that defense lawyers should uncover the relevant facts of a case, this is not the main focus of the passage. The author's primary concern is the balance between the defense lawyer's obligation to their client and their obligation to the court and society.

Option D is incorrect because the author does not suggest that the twofold obligation does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers. In fact, the author acknowledges that defense lawyers have a duty to provide the best defense possible, but argues that this duty must be balanced with their obligation to the court and society.",,,E,0,1506,443,1949,

Explanation:
The passage discusses Thurgood Marshall's contributions to public interest law, specifically his work with the NAACP. It highlights the strategies he developed, such as the test case strategy, and how he carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants. The passage also notes that Marshall used sociological and psychological statistics to transform constitutional law. The main point of the passage is that Marshall's strategies have become standard tactics for public interest lawyers and have been used in various public interest campaigns.

Explanation:
The passage states that the physics community during the 1930s never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium, despite numerous experiments that produced puzzling radioactive substances. The community was hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, and they were also limited by their expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. It wasn't until Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations that the physics community realized that they had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

Upon reflection, I realized that the passage does not explicitly state that Morrison credited Ellington with inspiring her style of narration.
I also considered answer B, but the passage does not mention anything about Ellington preventing his musicians from performing lengthy solos.
I then considered answer D, which seems to be the best fit based on the information in the passage.

Explanation:
The passage states that Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique ""voices"" in mind, and that his musicians performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame.
This implies that Ellington composed music that was specifically intended to be performed by the musicians he conducted, which is answer choice D.

The passage does not explicitly credit Ellington with inspiring Morrison's style of narration, so answer choice A is not supported.
There is no information in the passage about Ellington preventing his musicians from performing lengthy solos, so answer choice B is not supported.
Ellington is not mentioned as a character in Morrison's Jazz, so answer choice C is incorrect.
There is no information in the passage about Ellington composing music of other genres, so answer choice E is not supported.

Explanation:
The author refers to the centuries-old belief that wine has healthful effects in order to suggest that a prevailing scientific assumption - that wine, like other alcoholic beverages, has no active ingredients besides alcohol - might be mistaken. The author presents evidence that moderate wine consumption has healthful effects, which contradicts the assumption that alcohol is the only active ingredient in wine. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

I should have paid closer attention to the actual disagreement between the two passages, which is related to the reliability and scientific status of fingerprint identification.
I have now re-read the passages and correctly answered the question as Choice B.

Action: Answer(B)

Explanation:
The authors of Passage A and Passage B would likely disagree on the issue of whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law. Passage A asserts that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability, suggesting that it should be considered a scientific law. On the other hand, Passage B argues that there are no objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, casting doubt on its reliability and suitability for scientific law status.

Choices A, C, D, and E are not correct because they do not accurately reflect a point of disagreement between the two passages. Choice A is incorrect because both passages agree that uniformity in training is desirable. Choice C is incorrect because Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has been used for 100 years and is reliable, while Passage B argues that there are no objective standards for evaluation, but does not directly address the status of scientific law. Choice D is incorrect because both passages mention that different agencies have different requirements for correlation before permitting a positive identification, but this is not the main point of disagreement between the two passages. Choice E is incorrect because both passages acknowledge that fingerprint examiners can make mistakes, but they differ on the likelihood of such mistakes and the implications for the reliability of fingerprint identification.

  D: Corridos are noted for their vivid use of imagery and their attention to local events.
  E: The corrido is a type of folk song that promotes cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions.
","  Action: Answer(E)

The passage discusses the role of corridos, a type of narrative folk song, in promoting cohesiveness in Border communities. The author argues that corridos achieve this by using familiar conventions, such as conventional imagery and ready-made lines, which reflect and strengthen the continuity of the corrido tradition. The author also notes that corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Therefore, option E, which states that corridos promote cohesiveness in Border communities through the use of familiar conventions, accurately expresses the main point of the passage.

The other options do not accurately express the main point of the passage. Option A focuses on the imagery used in corridos, but does not address the role of conventions in promoting cohesiveness. Option B highlights the historical roots of corridos, but does not explain their function in promoting community cohesiveness. Option C emphasizes the use of ready-made lines in corridos, but does not discuss their impact on community cohesiveness. Option D mentions the attention to local events in corridos, but does not explain how this attention contributes to community cohesiveness.

I was focusing on the importance of multiple perspectives in understanding a culture, which is related to option C. However, the question specifically asked which option the critics would be most likely to agree with, and the correct answer is option B.

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The correct answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.

The critics discussed in the second paragraph argue that the values of non-Western cultures cannot be understood if they are studied solely from within the perspective of Western culture. They claim that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western and value-laden. Therefore, they would agree with option B, which states that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. This option aligns with the critics' argument that understanding the historical and social context of a culture is essential to understanding its values.

The other options do not align with the critics' argument. Option A states that members of a culture with different values cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values. Option C states that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective. While this option may be related to the critics' argument, it is not the same as saying that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of its values. Option D states that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values. This option is not supported by the passage, as the critics argue that understanding can be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, even if they are different from Western values. Option E states that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. While this option may be related to the critics' argument, it is not directly addressed in the passage.

The correct answer is E: A painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values.

Lichtenstein's work was characterized by its use of comic book imagery and stylized representations of everyday objects, with a focus on reconciling parody and true feeling. A painting that depicts products as they appear in magazine advertisements to comment on society's values aligns with Lichtenstein's style and themes, as it uses a popular genre (advertising) to make a commentary on contemporary life.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the question and the passage. I thought the question was asking about the Pin Factory model's failure to gain prominence, and I incorrectly assumed that it was due to ideological reasons. I also misread the passage and thought it said that the Pin Factory model was not scientific because it lacked mathematical rigor.

After re-reading the passage, I realized that the question is asking about the reason why the Pin Factory model failed to gain prominence among economists for so long. The passage states that it was not due to ideology, but rather due to the lack of mathematical rigor in representing the ideas. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Action: Answer(C)

Explanation:
The passage states that the long-standing failure of the Pin Factory model to gain prominence among economists was not a problem of ideology, but rather a problem of mathematical rigor. The author explains that the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns - the Pin Factory - are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

A: The passage does not state that the only way to achieve increasing returns to scale is through increases in the specialization of workers. In fact, the passage suggests that increasing returns can arise from a variety of sources, including specialization and scale.

B: The passage does not state that economics fails in its quest to be scientific because its models lack mathematical rigor. While the author notes that economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations, the passage does not suggest that this quest is unattainable or that economics is inherently flawed.

D: The passage does not state that under the Pin Factory model, no one is in a position to exert monopoly power. In fact, the passage suggests that the natural tendency of increasing returns is toward monopoly, since a large business can achieve larger scale and lower costs than a small business.

E: The passage does not state that Adam Smith did not recognize any tension between the Pin Factory model and the Invisible Hand model. In fact, the author notes that Smith recognized the tension between the two concepts and struggled to reconcile them.

Passage B relies on unsubstantiated assumptions by questioning the reliability of fingerprint identification without providing conclusive evidence to support its claims. It highlights the lack of objective standards and the unknown error rate, but it does not offer a definitive solution or alternative approach.

Passage A, on the other hand, does not rely on unsubstantiated assumptions. It accepts the reliability of fingerprint identification based on its long-standing use and expert consensus, even though further testing and development of consistent standards may be desirable.

However, a closer reading of the text reveals that the author is actually highlighting the challenges faced by economists who tried to incorporate the Pin Factory model into mainstream economic thought and expressing a sense of curiosity and receptivity towards the idea.

Explanation:
The author's attitude towards the idea that the Pin Factory model should be part of the mainstream of economic thought is best described as receptive. The author notes that the idea has been marginalized for centuries and that many economists have tried and failed to incorporate it into mainstream economic thought. However, the author also notes that the ""underground river"" of increasing returns has finally surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought since the late 1970s, suggesting that the author is open to the idea of the Pin Factory model being part of mainstream economic thought.

  D: The invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press.
  E: Near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies.
","  Action: Answer(""C"")

The author would agree with the statement that expanded access to printed texts across a population has historically led to an increase in literacy in that population. The author mentions that before the printing press was introduced, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resourcesâ€”and in numbers once thought impossibleâ€”can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. This suggests that the author believes that increased access to technology, in this case, printed texts, leads to a more equal distribution of resources and opportunities, which is in line with choice C.

It is not clear from the passage whether the author would agree with the other choices. Choice A, that the democratizing influence of technology generally contributes to technological obsolescence, is not supported by the passage. The author does not mention anything about technological obsolescence, and the passage suggests that technological advancements have a positive impact on society by making resources and opportunities more accessible to a wider population.

Choice B, that wholly unregulated economies are probably the fastest in producing an equalization of social status, is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. While the author does mention that market competition drives prices down and tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, they do not explicitly state that unregulated economies are the fastest in producing an equalization of social status.

Choice D, that the invention of the telephone has had a greater democratizing influence on society than has the invention of the printing press, is not supported by the passage. The author does mention that the invention of the telephone has greatly extended the power of distant communication, but they do not suggest that it has had a greater democratizing influence than the printing press.

Choice E, that near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies, is not mentioned in the passage. While the author does suggest that market competition tends to diffuse access to new technology across society, they do not explicitly state that near equality of financial assets among people is a realistic goal for market economies.

  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
","  Action: Answer(""E"")

Explanation:
The worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. It is an impulsive and emotional reaction to a perceived injustice, rather than a calculated decision based on a cost-benefit analysis of potential outcomes. The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected overall satisfaction or utility, but physically assaulting someone is unlikely to result in a positive outcome for the worker, and could lead to negative consequences such as legal troubles, damage to his reputation, and further strained relationships with his former employer and colleagues.

The other options can be described as rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives:

A: The waiter's decision to conceal his tip income to reduce his taxes is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding taxes.

B: The motorist's decision to avoid speeding is a rational response to the economic disincentive of a speeding ticket and the potential loss of her driver's license.

C: The industrialist's decision to illegally discharge the pollutant is a rational response to the economic incentive of avoiding the cost of treatment, even though it is illegal.

D: The government official's decision to risk prosecution for soliciting bribes is a rational response to the economic disincentive of a low government salary in the face of rampant inflation.

Therefore, option E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A instead of option E. Upon reflection, I realized that my initial answer was incorrect because the waiter's decision to conceal his tip income is indeed a rational response to economic incentives, as it allows him to avoid paying taxes and increase his expected utility.

In contrast, the worker's decision to physically assault his former supervisor is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives. It is an impulsive and emotional reaction, rather than a calculated decision based on a cost-benefit analysis of potential outcomes. Therefore, option E is the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Explanation:
As mentioned in my reflection, the passage describes Thurgood Marshall's test case strategy as unprecedented, indicating that it was a new approach to challenging state-sanctioned racial segregation.

I also failed to consider the author's emphasis on the uniqueness and generic continuity of corridos, which is closely tied to the use of the despedida.

Action: Answer(E)

The passage suggests that the author would agree with the statement that a corrido without a surviving despedida would be incomplete or lacking in some way. The author highlights the importance of the despedida in marking the end of the ballad and emphasizes its role in asserting the authenticity of the corrido's tale. The absence of a despedida would likely detract from the corrido's impact and significance, as it would lack the formal closing verse that is a hallmark of the genre.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, choosing option A.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to a misinterpretation of the passage.
I misunderstood the relationship between plants and insects, thinking that the diversity of secondary substances was directly proportional to the number of insects interacting with the plant population.
However, the passage states that the diversity of secondary substances is a result of an evolutionary competition between plants and plant-eating insects, and not a direct result of the number of insects interacting with the plants.
Therefore, I should have chosen option D, which states that no particular secondary substance has appeared in plants in direct response to insects, though in many instances insects have influenced which particular secondary substances are present in a plant species.

The correct answer is option C, as the author discusses metaphor to emphasize the centrality of poetic language to corridos. The author highlights the use of everyday images in metaphors and the conventional nature of storm imagery in corridos. This emphasis on poetic language underscores the importance of language in shaping the corrido tradition and its narratives.

  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
","  Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit,"" and that only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. He defined ""artistry"" as the ability to express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Option A is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy. In fact, Dostoyevsky believed that reality and fantasy were intimately bound up with each other, and that the fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it.

Option B is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work. Dostoyevsky believed that artistry was the ability to write well, and that a literary work must be judged on its artistic merit, regardless of its purpose.

Option C is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works. In fact, Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, and that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.

Option E is not correct because the passage does not suggest that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be softened if the radical critics were to explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is. Dostoyevsky believed that the demand that reality be depicted ""as it is"" was meaningless, and that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option B instead of option D. Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to a misreading of the passage. I misunderstood Dostoyevsky's emphasis on artistic merit as being in conflict with the radical critics' demand for usefulness, rather than recognizing that artistic merit was a necessary component of any successful literary work. I also failed to consider the context of Dostoyevsky's time and the debate between the radical critics and the proponents of art for art's sake.

In correcting my mistake, I re-read the passage carefully and considered the options in light of Dostoyevsky's views on artistic merit and the relationship between reality and fantasy. I realized that option D was the best answer, as it most closely aligned with Dostoyevsky's belief in the importance of artistic merit in literary works.

I learned from this experience the importance of carefully reading and analyzing the passage, as well as considering the historical context in which the author was writing. I also learned the importance of taking the time to reflect on my mistakes and to consider alternative perspectives before arriving at a final answer.",,,D,0,1554,747,2301,

Explanation:
The reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52-54) serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development. The author argues that entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, which involves structuring their prices to consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. This explanation reinforces the thesis that technological developments have served as a democratizing force and narrowed the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people. Therefore, option D is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because the reference to maximization of financial success is not part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.

I was focusing on Dostoyevsky's view of artistic merit rather than the usefulness of literature.
I also realized that the question asked about Dostoyevsky's view on the usefulness of literature, which is different from my initial interpretation.

Action: Answer(""C"")

The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky believed a work of literature's primary goal should be to express the author's thoughts and ideas effectively, rather than serving a particular political or social purpose.
Therefore, the description of a work of literature as ""useful"" in this context would refer to its ability to communicate the author's thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively, rather than its potential to bring about social change or serve a particular political agenda.

Option A is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of the fantastic in literature, he does not describe it as a key aspect of a work's ""usefulness.""

Option B is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of artistic merit in literature, he does not describe it as a key aspect of a work's ""usefulness.""

Option D is incorrect because while Dostoyevsky does discuss the importance of exploding the boundaries of the tangible world, he does not describe this as a key aspect of a work's ""usefulness.""

Upon reflection, I realized that the author's primary purpose in the passage is not to analyze and commend the variety of contributions to the art of the novel made by a particular writer, but rather to describe a particular aspect of one work by a particular writer. The author does commend Toni Morrison's work, but this is not the primary purpose of the passage.

Therefore, I have selected option C as the correct answer. The author's primary purpose in the passage is to describe a particular aspect of one work by a particular writer, specifically Toni Morrison's novel Jazz. The author examines the structural elements of the novel, such as the use of multiple narrators and the integration of musical elements, and discusses how these elements contribute to the overall effect of the work. The author also compares Morrison's approach to narrative structure to the compositional techniques of Duke Ellington, highlighting the similarities between the two artists' approaches.

Explanation:
The author's primary aim in the passage is to illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress. The passage explains how scientists overlooked the possibility of nuclear fission despite amassing evidence that suggested it was possible.

","  Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The passage states that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility that atoms might be split, and that their research was hampered by their expectation that the by-products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, option B, ""The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products,"" would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Without preconceived notions about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, the physicists would have been more open to considering alternative explanations for the data they were collecting, including the possibility of nuclear fission. This would have allowed them to recognize the significance of the evidence more quickly and come to the conclusion that atoms were being split sooner.

The correct answer is (A) ""...whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art"" (lines 8-10).

The author's attitude toward the novel Jazz in this excerpt is one of admiration and appreciation for the artistic achievement of African American music, which is reflected in the novel's unique narrative structure. The other excerpts do not express the same level of admiration and appreciation for the novel's connection to music.

Excerpt (B) highlights the novel's unique connection to music in its narrative structure, but does not express the same level of admiration as excerpt (A).

Excerpt (C) describes the narrative structure in a positive light, emphasizing its ease and fluidity, but does not express the same level of admiration as excerpt (A).

Excerpt (D) describes the novel's unique narrative structure, but does not express the same level of admiration as excerpt (A).

","  Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
The author of passage A would likely agree with choice D, as it suggests a more targeted and efficient approach to collecting overdue water bills. Placing liens on properties owned by those who are late paying their bills would be a more effective way to collect debts without imposing unnecessary social costs, which aligns with the author's views on reducing the costs of overinclusion.

The other choices do not align with the author's views or the content of passage A:

A: This choice suggests waiting until after the legislature's annual appropriations hearing to implement the plan, which is not related to the author's views on law enforcement or overinclusion.

B: This choice suggests that the plan would have a lower social cost than turning off the water of all 231,000 households that have not paid on time, but it does not address the issue of overinclusion or propose a more targeted approach.

C: This choice suggests that the plan is a reasonable response to the water department's history of enforcing overinclusive rules to the letter, but it does not align with the author's views on the limitations of law enforcement.

E: This choice suggests introducing specific laws regarding the payment of water bills to provide a more effective set of incentives, but it does not address the issue of overinclusion or propose a more targeted approach.

Reflection:
I initially answered this question incorrectly, choosing choice C. However, upon reflection, I realized that the correct answer is choice D. The author of passage A emphasizes the need to reduce the costs of overinclusion and proposes discretionary nonenforcement as a solution. Choice D aligns with this approach by suggesting a targeted and efficient way to collect overdue water bills, rather than implementing a plan that would have a high social cost.

In conclusion, the author of passage A would likely agree with choice D, as it offers a more effective and targeted approach to collecting overdue water bills while minimizing social costs.",,D,B,0,1553,462,2015,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A.
Upon reflection, I realized that my answer was incorrect because the question asks for the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education, and option A does not address the criticism directly.
I also considered option E, which emphasizes the importance of understanding other cultures, but I was not sure if it was the strongest objection.

Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education argues that understanding other cultures requires adopting the perspectives and methods of those cultures, which Western scientific methods cannot achieve. Therefore, option E, which asserts that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education. It emphasizes the importance of understanding other cultures, which the second version of multicultural education fails to achieve by relying on Western scientific methods.

Option A is incorrect because, although it may be difficult for outsiders to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture, it is not impossible. Option B is also incorrect because the similarity of value systems among non-Western societies does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding cultures with different values. Option C is incorrect because, although some non-Western societies may use their own value systems when studying cultures with different values, this does not address the criticism that Western scientific methods are inadequate for understanding cultures with different values. Option D is unrelated to the criticism in the passage and does not address the issue of understanding other cultures.

Action: Answer(D)

Explanation:
The fourth paragraph describes the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, two competing economic assumptions. The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns to scale, where larger firms can achieve lower costs and drive smaller firms out of business, leading to monopolies. On the other hand, the Invisible Hand represents the idea of competition, where many firms compete with each other to achieve efficiency and lower prices. The paragraph explains how economists have struggled to reconcile these two concepts, as the Pin Factory suggests that larger firms can dominate smaller ones, while the Invisible Hand assumes many competitors in each industry.

I previously answered this question incorrectly because I misunderstood the scenario and the options. I thought that the shift to digital publishing would lead to a greater need for warehousing of paper and binding materials, so I chose option A. However, upon re-reading the scenario and the options, I realized that the demand for physical books and therefore, the demand for book-grade paper, would decrease.

Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The scenario described in the first two paragraphs suggests that the demand for physical books will decrease as digital publishing becomes more prevalent. This decrease in demand for physical books will likely lead to a decrease in the demand for book-grade paper. Therefore, option E, ""The demand for book-grade paper will decrease significantly,"" is the correct answer.

The other options do not logically follow from the scenario described:

A) The need for warehousing will shift mainly from that of individual books to that of paper and binding material to make books. - This option is incorrect because the scenario describes a shift from physical books to digital publications, which would reduce the need for warehousing overall, rather than shifting the need to a different type of material.

B) The patronage of stores that sell used books will increase significantly. - This option is incorrect because the scenario describes a shift to digital publications, which would likely reduce the demand for used books and therefore the patronage of stores that sell them.

C) Most publishers will sell their own books individually and will not use distributors or retailers. - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not describe a shift away from traditional publishing models, but rather a shift to digital publishing models that would still involve publishers, distributors, and retailers.

D) There will be significantly less demand by publishers for the services of copy editors and book designers. - This option is incorrect because the scenario does not describe a reduction in the need for copy editors and book designers, but rather a shift to digital publishing models that would still require these services.",,,A,0,1419,447,1866,

The passage states that there is no consensus on what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification and that local practices vary.

Therefore, option C, differences in the identification practices used by various fingerprint examiners, is the correct answer.

The passage suggests that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to decrease if the expected utility of lawful activities decreases. This statement is consistent with the idea that individuals will choose to commit a deliberate crime if the expected utility from doing so exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity. If the expected utility of lawful activities decreases, it becomes less likely for individuals to choose to commit deliberate crimes.

The other options are not consistent with the ideas presented in the passage:

A: The passage does not suggest that the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to fall if laws requiring stronger punishments for repeat offenders are adopted. Instead, the passage suggests that increasing penalties for crimes and strengthening law enforcement will lower the expected utility from criminal activity, making it less likely for individuals to choose to commit deliberate crimes.

B: The passage does not suggest that the rate at which criminals return to criminal activity is likely to increase if efforts to rehabilitate them are ended. Instead, the passage suggests that rehabilitating those convicted of deliberate crimes will reduce the crime rate.

D: The passage does not suggest that the rate of deliberate crimes is likely to increase if the access of individuals to economic institutions decreases. Instead, the passage suggests that increasing the access of individuals to economic institutions will reduce the crime rate.

","  Action: Answer(E)

Explanation:
The correct answer is E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.

The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to the process of creating written documents that reflect the collaboration between individuals from different cultures. In the context of the passage, this refers to the written accounts of Native American life histories that were created through the collaboration of non-Native American collaborators and Native American storytellers. The passage suggests that these accounts were based on oral traditions and artifacts of Native American cultures, but were written down by non-Native American collaborators. Therefore, option E accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase, as it implies that the written works are based on oral communication by members of one culture (Native Americans) but are written down by members of another culture (non-Native Americans).
