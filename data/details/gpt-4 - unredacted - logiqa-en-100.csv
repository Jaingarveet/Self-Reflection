Given that J is the fourth speaker, this means J speaks after lunch. 
From the conditions, we know that G must speak before lunch, so G must be one of the first three speakers.

Since J is the fourth speaker, the third speaker cannot be J, so the third speaker must be F. 
However, considering the condition that ""Only one speaker is between M and N"", if F is the third speaker, there would be no way to place M and N with one speaker between them. Therefore, the third speaker must be either M or N.

The inference is that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. This is based on the fact that Zhang Shan's bonus is higher than Li Si's and Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Miao Xiaoqin's. Therefore, any assumption that does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses would not necessarily make the inference hold. The assumption that Wang Wu's bonus is higher than Li Si's (Choice A) does not directly relate to the comparison between Zhang Shan and Miao Xiaoqin's bonuses, and therefore does not necessarily make the inference hold.
