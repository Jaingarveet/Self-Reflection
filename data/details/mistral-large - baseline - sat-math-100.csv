  A: $v=h+k-16 t$

  D: $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$
","Thought:
To find $v$ in terms of $h, t$, and $k$, we need to isolate $v$ in the given equation.

Starting with $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$, we can subtract $k$ from both sides to get $h-k=-16 t^{2}+v t$.
Then, we can divide both sides by $t$ to get $\frac{h-k}{t}=-16 t+\frac{v t}{t}$.
Finally, we can simplify the right side to get $\frac{h-k}{t}=-16 t+v$.
Adding $16t$ to both sides, we get $v=\frac{h-k}{t}+16 t$.

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. Starting with the original equation, $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$, in order to get $v$ in terms of the other variables, $-16 t^{2}$ and $k$ need to be subtracted from each side.

However, the equation $v=\frac{h+16 t^{2}-k}{t}$ is not one of the options, so the right side needs to be further simplified.

If the line passes through the origin, then the slope of the line is given by the formula:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)

where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two points on the line.

Using the given points (2, k) and (k, 32), we can calculate the slope:

m = (32 - k) / (k - 2)

Since the line passes through the origin, we know that the slope is also given by:

m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (32 - 0) / (k - 0) = 32/k

Therefore, we have:

32/k = (32 - k) / (k - 2)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

32(k - 2) = k(32 - k)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

32k - 64 = 32k - k^2

Rearranging, we get:

k^2 = 64

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

k = Â±8

Since k cannot be negative (since it is a coordinate of a point), we have:

k = 8

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The line passes through the origin, (2, $k)$, and $(k, 32)$. Any two of these points can be used to find the slope of the line. Since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(2, k)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{k-0}{2-0}=\frac{k}{2}$. Similarly, since the line passes through $(0,0)$ and $(k, 32)$, the slope of the line is equal to $\frac{32-0}{k-0}=\frac{32}{k}$. Since each expression gives the slope of the same line, it must be true that $\frac{k}{2}=\frac{32}{k}$.

To find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we need to set the equations for $b$ and $c$ equal to each other and solve for $x$.

$2.35 + 0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x$

Subtracting $0.25x$ from both sides, we get:

$2.35 = 1.75 + 0.15x$

Subtracting $1.75$ from both sides, we get:

$0.60 = 0.15x$

Dividing both sides by $0.15$, we get:

$x = 4$

Now that we know that the prices were equal after 4 weeks, we can substitute $x = 4$ into either equation to find the price per pound. We'll use the equation for $b$:

The table shows that when $x=a$, $y=0$, so the y-intercept is 0. This means that the equation of the line must be in the form $y=mx$.

When $x=3a$, $y=-a$, so we can substitute these values into the equation to find the slope: $-a=m(3a)$, which simplifies to $m=-1/3$.

Therefore, the equation of the line is $y=-1/3x$.

We can rearrange this equation to $x+3y=0$.

Comparing this to the answer choices, we can see that none of them match exactly. However, we can manipulate the equation to match one of the choices.

Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$.

","Thought:
To find the weight of the object on another planet, we need to use the formula $W=m g$. We know the weight of the object on Earth is 150 newtons, so we can find its mass by rearranging the formula to $m=\frac{W}{g}$. Using the value of $g$ for Earth from the chart, we get $m=\frac{150}{9.8} \approx 15.3$ kg.
Now we can use this mass to find the weight of the object on each of the planets listed in the choices. We'll use the values of $g$ from the chart and the formula $W=m g$ to calculate the weight on each planet.

* Venus: $W=15.3 \times 8.9 \approx 136$ newtons
* Saturn: $W=15.3 \times 11.1 \approx 170$ newtons
* Uranus: $W=15.3 \times 10.7 \approx 164$ newtons

The weight of the object on Saturn is approximately 170 newtons.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$.

Substituting this mass into the formula $W=m g$ and now using the weight of 170 newtons gives $170=15.3 g$, which shows that the second planet's acceleration due to gravity is about $11.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}^{2}$. According to the table, this value for the acceleration due to gravity holds on Saturn.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect.

For a system of linear equations to have no solution, the equations must be parallel lines, meaning their slopes are equal but their y-intercepts are different.
The slope of the first equation is -3, and the slope of the second equation is -a/2.
For the slopes to be equal, -3 = -a/2. Solving for a, we get a = 6.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form. This yields $y=3 x+6$ and $y=\left(-\frac{a}{2}\right) x+2$. The slope and $y$-intercept of the line with equation $-3 x+y=6$ are 3 and $(0,6)$, respectively.

Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the expanded equation, we get $a(8-a) x^{2}+7 a x+2(8-a) x+14$.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31.

","Thought:
To find the linear function that models the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept.

The slope can be found by using any two points from the table and calculating the change in shipping charge divided by the change in weight. For example, using the points (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89), we get:

slope = (21.89 - 16.94) / (10 - 5) = 4.95 / 5 = 0.99

The y-intercept can be found by using one of the points and plugging it into the equation of a line, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Using the point (5, 16.94), we get:

16.94 = 0.99(5) + b
16.94 = 4.95 + b
b = 11.99

Therefore, the linear function that models the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is correct. Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

The mean is the average of the data set, and it is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the sum of the values, and therefore decrease the mean.

The median is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in order. Since there are 21 values, the median is the 11th value. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will not change the median, since it is not the 11th value.

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set. Removing the outlier of 24 inches will decrease the range, since it is the largest value.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is incorrect because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

","Thought:
Let's denote the number of left-handed female students as LF and the number of right-handed female students as RF. Similarly, let's denote the number of left-handed male students as LM and the number of right-handed male students as RM.

We know that:

* LF + RF + LM + RM = 18 + 122 = 140
* LF + LM = 18
* RF + RM = 122
* RF = 5 \* LF
* RM = 9 \* LM

We need to find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female, which is equal to RF / (RF + RM).

We can solve the equations above to find the values of LF, RF, LM, and RM.

From the second equation, we have LF = 18 - LM.

Substituting this into the fourth equation, we get RF = 5 \* (18 - LM) = 90 - 5 \* LM.

Substituting the expressions for LF and RF into the first equation, we get:

(18 - LM) + (90 - 5 \* LM) + LM + RM = 140

Simplifying this equation, we get:

108 - 4 \* LM + RM = 140

Substituting the expression for RM from the fifth equation, we get:

108 - 4 \* LM + 9 \* LM = 140

Simplifying this equation, we get:

5 \* LM = 32

LM = 32 / 5 = 6.4

Since the number of students must be an integer, we round LM to the nearest integer, which is 6.

Substituting LM = 6 into the second equation, we get LF = 18 - 6 = 12.

Substituting LM = 6 into the fifth equation, we get RM = 9 \* 6 = 54.

Substituting LF = 12 into the fourth equation, we get RF = 5 \* 12 = 60.

Now we can find the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female:

P(female | right-handed) = RF / (RF + RM) = 60 / (60 + 54) = 60 / 114 â 0.526

However, none of the answer choices is close to this value. There must be an error in the problem statement or in our calculations.

After reviewing the problem statement and our calculations, we noticed that we made an error in rounding LM to the nearest integer. Since LM must be an integer, we should have rounded it down to 6 instead of up to 7.

With LM = 6, we have LF = 18 - 6 = 12, RF = 5 \* 12 = 60, and RM = 9 \* 6 = 54.

Now we can find the correct probability:

P(female | right-handed) = RF / (RF + RM) = 60 / (60 + 54) = 60 / 114 â 0.526

This value is still not close to any of the answer choices. There must be another error in the problem statement or in our calculations.

After reviewing the problem statement again, we noticed that we misinterpreted the question. The question asks for the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female, not the probability that a female student selected at random is right-handed.

With this correction, we can find the correct probability:

After reviewing the problem statement and our calculations again, we noticed that we made an error in calculating the total number of students. The total number of students is not 140, but 18 + 122 = 140 - 2 = 138.

The problem states that there is a $1 %$ annual increase in the number of pollen grains per square centimeter. This means that the number of pollen grains per square centimeter increases by a factor of $1 + 0.01 = 1.01$ each year.

The function that models $P(t)$, the number of pollen grains per square centimeter $t$ years after the first year the grains were deposited, is therefore given by:

$P(t) = 310(1.01)^t$

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. A model for a quantity that increases by $r \%$ per time period is an exponential function of the form $P(t)=I\left(1+\frac{r}{100}\right)^{t}$, where $I$ is the initial value at time $t=0$ and each increase of $t$ by 1 represents 1 time period. It's given that $P(t)$ is the number of pollen grains per square centimeter and $t$ is the number of years after the first year the grains were deposited. There were 310 pollen grains at time $t=0$, so $I=310$. This number increased $1 \%$ per year after year $t=0$, so $r=1$.

To find the total number of juniors and seniors who were inducted into the National Honor Society, we need to calculate the number of juniors and seniors who were inducted separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of juniors who were inducted:
7 percent of 562 juniors = (7/100) x 562 = 39.34, which we can round to 39 since we cannot have a fraction of a person.

Next, let's calculate the number of seniors who were inducted:
5 percent of 602 seniors = (5/100) x 602 = 30.1, which we can round to 30 since we cannot have a fraction of a person.

Now, let's add the number of juniors and seniors who were inducted:

First, we need to find the probability that a tablet user did not answer ""Never."" This is equal to 1 - the probability that a tablet user answered ""Never.""
The probability that a tablet user answered ""Never"" is 31.3%, so the probability that a tablet user did not answer ""Never"" is 1 - 0.313 = 0.687.
Next, we need to find the probability that a tablet user answered ""Always"" and did not answer ""Never."" This is equal to the probability that a tablet user answered ""Always"" divided by the probability that a tablet user did not answer ""Never.""
The probability that a tablet user answered ""Always"" is 30.9%, so the probability that a tablet user answered ""Always"" and did not answer ""Never"" is 0.309 / 0.687 = 0.449.

","Thought:
To find the length of $\overline{A B}$, we need to find the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
To do this, we can set the equations of the parabola and the line equal to each other and solve for $x$:
$(x-11)^{2} = 25$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$x-11 = \pm 5$
Solving for $x$, we get two possible values: $x = 11 + 5 = 16$ and $x = 11 - 5 = 6$.
These are the $x$-coordinates of points $A$ and $B$.
To find the $y$-coordinates, we can substitute these values of $x$ into either equation.
Using the equation of the line, we get:
$y = 25$ for both points.
Therefore, the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 25)$ and $(16, 25)$.
To find the length of $\overline{A B}$, we can use the distance formula:
$\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}} = \sqrt{(16-6)^{2}+(25-25)^{2}} = \sqrt{10^{2}+0^{2}} = 10$
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. Substituting 25 for $y$ in the equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ gives $25=(x-11)^{2}$. It follows that $x-11=5$ or $x-11=-5$, so the $x$-coordinates of the two points of intersection are $x=16$ and $x=6$, respectively. Since both points of intersection have a $y$-coordinate of 25 , it follows that the two points are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$. Since these points lie on the horizontal line $y=25$, the distance between these points is the positive difference of the $x$-coordinates: $16-6=10$.Alternatively, since a translation is a rigid motion, the distance between points $A$ and $B$ would be the same as the distance between the points of intersection of the line $y=25$ and the parabola $y=x^{2}$. Since those graphs intersect at $(0,5)$ and $(0,-5)$, the distance between the two points, and thus the distance between $A$ and $B$, is 10 .Choices B, C, and D are incorrect and may be the result of an error in solving the quadratic equation that results when substituting 25 for $y$ in the given quadratic equation.",A,A,1,343,324,667,

$$-t(4.9 t-25) = 0$$
Setting each factor equal to 0, we get:

The engineer estimates that the population will decrease by 10 percent every 20 years. This means that after 20 years, the population will be 90 percent of what it was before.

To represent this mathematically, we can use the formula for exponential decay:

$P(t) = P\_0 (1 - r)^{t/k}$

where $P(t)$ is the population at time $t$, $P\_0$ is the initial population, $r$ is the rate of decay (as a decimal), and $k$ is the time period over which the decay occurs.

In this case, $P\_0 = 50,000$, $r = 0.1$, and $k = 20$.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$P(t) = 50,000 (1 - 0.1)^{t/20}$

$P(t) = 50,000 (0.9)^{t/20}$

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. For the present population to decrease by 10 percent, it must be multiplied by the factor 0.9.

  C: 20
  D: 22
","Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
","Thought:
Let's denote the original length of the rectangle as L and the original width as W. The original area of the rectangle is L \* W.
After the alterations, the length becomes 1.1L and the width becomes (1 - p/100)W. The new area is 1.1L \* (1 - p/100)W.
According to the question, the new area is 88% of the original area. So we have:
1.1L \* (1 - p/100)W = 0.88L \* W

Dividing both sides by L \* W, we get:
1.1 \* (1 - p/100) = 0.88

Now, we can solve for p:
1.1 - 1.1p/100 = 0.88
1.1p/100 = 1.1 - 0.88
1.1p/100 = 0.22
p = 0.22 \* 100 / 1.1
p â 20

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Let $\ell$ and $w$ be the length and width, respectively, of the original rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is $A=\ell w$. The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$. Therefore, $\frac{p}{100}=0.2$, and so the value of $p$ is 20 .Choice $A$ is incorrect and may be the result of confusing the 12 percent decrease in area with the percent decrease in width. Choice $B$ is incorrect because decreasing the width by 15 percent results in a 6.5 percent decrease in area, not a 12 percent decrease.

","Thought:
To solve the system of equations, we can use substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method.
Multiply the second equation by 2 and add it to the first equation:
$$\begin{array}{r}3 x+4 y=-23 \\4 y-2 x=-38\end{array}$$
Adding the two equations, we get:
$$x+8 y=-61$$
Now, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
$$y=-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8} x$$
Substitute this expression for $y$ into the second equation:
$$2\left(-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8} x\right)-x=-19$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$-\frac{122}{8}-\frac{1}{4} x-x=-19$$
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get:
$$-122-x-4 x=-76$$
Combining like terms, we get:
$$-5 x=46$$
Dividing both sides by $-5$, we get:
$$x=-9.2$$
Substituting $x=-9.2$ into the expression for $y$, we get:
$$y=-\frac{61}{8}-\frac{1}{8}(-9.2)=-7.6-1.15=-8.75$$
Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is $(-9.2,-8.75)$.
However, this is not one of the given choices.

A: $(-5,-2)$
Substituting $x=-5$ and $y=-2$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(-5)+4(-2)=-15-8=-23$$
Therefore, $(-5,-2)$ satisfies the first equation.
Substituting $x=-5$ and $y=-2$ into the second equation, we get:
$$2(-2)-(-5)=-4+5=1$$
Therefore, $(-5,-2)$ does not satisfy the second equation.
B: $(3,-8)$
Substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(3)+4(-8)=9-32=-23$$
Therefore, $(3,-8)$ satisfies the first equation.
Substituting $x=3$ and $y=-8$ into the second equation, we get:
$$2(-8)-(3)=-16-3=-19$$
Therefore, $(3,-8)$ satisfies the second equation.
C: $(4,-6)$
Substituting $x=4$ and $y=-6$ into the first equation, we get:
$$3(4)+4(-6)=12-24=-12$$
Therefore, $(4,-6)$ does not satisfy the first equation.
D: $(9,-6)$
