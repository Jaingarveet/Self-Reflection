  D: Garcia is the only witness scheduled to testify on Monday and Hong is one of two witnesses scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  E: Jackson is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and two witnesses are scheduled to testify on Monday.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
The key constraints are:
- Iturbe testifies on Wednesday
- Exactly 2 witnesses testify on Tuesday 
- Hong does not testify on Monday
- At least 1 witness testifies on Monday
- Franco and Garcia do not testify the same day
Looking at the choices:
A) This is possible. Franco could be Monday's only witness, with 2 on Tuesday and Garcia and Iturbe on Wednesday.
B) This is impossible. We know Iturbe testifies Wednesday, so Franco can't testify the same day as Iturbe since he can't testify the same day as Garcia.
C) This works. Garcia and Hong could be Tuesday's 2 witnesses, with 1-2 on Monday and Iturbe + 0-1 others on Wednesday.
D) This is doable. Garcia on Monday, 2 on Tuesday, then Hong and Iturbe on Wednesday satisfies all constraints.
E) This is impossible. If Jackson is 1 of the 2 Tuesday witnesses, and 2 testify Monday, then there would be fewer than 2 witnesses on Tuesday.
Therefore, the correct answer is B. Franco cannot be scheduled to testify on the same day as Iturbe.

Choices:
  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.

  A: A restaurant must be in either space 3, space 4, or space 5.
  B: A restaurant must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C: Either the toy store or the veterinarian must be somewhere between the two restaurants.
  D: No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it.
  E: The optometrist cannot be next to the shoe store.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The original constraint states that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. This means there must be at least two spaces between the restaurants.
2. With seven spaces in total, this constraint allows for the following possible locations of the restaurants:
   - Spaces 1 and 4 (or 4 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 5 (or 3 and 7) 
   - Spaces 1 and 6 (or 2 and 7)
   - Spaces 1 and 7
3. Now, let's consider each of the answer choices:
   A: This would restrict a restaurant to the middle three spaces, which is not equivalent to the original constraint.
   B: This does not ensure the required separation between the restaurants.
   C: This is not equivalent to the original constraint. If either the toy store or the veterinarian is between the restaurants, it does not guarantee that there are at least two businesses separating the restaurants.
   D: This is equivalent to the original constraint. If no more than two businesses separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it, then the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses.
   E: This is unrelated to the separation of the restaurants.
4. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Substituting the original constraint with ""No more than two businesses can separate the pharmacy and the restaurant nearest it"" would have the same effect in determining the locations of the businesses.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
Given:
- Robertson is assigned parking space #3
- Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson 
- Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza
If Robertson is assigned #3:
- Young must be assigned #1 or #2 (lower than Robertson's #3)
- Togowa must be assigned #1 (lower than Young)
So with Robertson in #3 and Togowa in #1, Young must be assigned #2.
That leaves parking spaces #4, #5 and #6 for Souza, Vaughn and Xu.
We know Xu must have a higher number than Souza.
But the specific assignments of Souza, Vaughn and Xu to #4, #5 and #6 cannot be definitively determined based on the given information.

- P is performed before S
- At least one composition is performed between O and S

Step 4: If Nina reports on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must report the following day. But Helen has a morning slot, so Nina cannot report on Monday or Tuesday, as that would force Helen to take an afternoon slot the next day.

","You're right, I made a mistake in my previous answer. Let me think through this again step-by-step:
1. The question states that both botanists G and H are selected for the panel. 
2. The conditions state that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
3. Since two botanists are already selected, the panel can include at most one zoologist.
4. The conditions also state that if chemist M is selected, then both zoologists P and R must be selected. 
5. However, selecting both P and R would violate the condition in step 2, since only one zoologist can be selected when more than one botanist is selected.
6. Therefore, chemist M cannot be selected for the panel. The panel must include either chemist K or chemist L.
7. The conditions state that F and K cannot both be selected. 
8. Since either K or L must be selected, and F and K cannot both be selected, the correct answer is that the panel must include either F or K.

2. Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday. 
3. If Nina had given the Tuesday morning report, both Helen and Irving would need to give reports on Wednesday. But Helen is already giving the afternoon report, so Irving must be giving the Wednesday morning report, and Nina did not give a report on Tuesday.
4. For Monday morning, the only remaining options are Robert, Lenore, Olivia and Nina. 
5. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Robert is the only one of the two not already scheduled, so Robert must give the Monday morning report.

  D: Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
  E: Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
The original constraint states that if Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. This means:
1) Jaramillo can be assigned only if Kayne is also assigned.
2) Kayne can be assigned without Jaramillo being assigned.
Now, let's examine each answer choice:
A) ""If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo."" 
This is the converse of the original statement. It changes the meaning because it would require Jaramillo to be assigned whenever Kayne is, which is not the same as the original constraint.
B) ""If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.""
This is irrelevant to the original constraint about Jaramillo and Kayne.
C) ""If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.""
This is also irrelevant to the original constraint.
D) ""Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.""
This captures the essence of the original constraint. If Jaramillo is assigned, Novetzke cannot be assigned because Kayne must be. This has the same effect as the original.
E) ""Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.""
This is once again irrelevant to the original constraint.
Therefore, the correct answer is D.

  C: Q is second.
  D: S is fifth

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step given the new information:
1. We know G is fourth. This means J must be first, second, or third (since J must be earlier than G), and R must be fifth, sixth, or seventh (since R must be later than G).
2. S must be earlier than Y. And if Q is not third, then Q must be later than S. 
3. One possible ordering that satisfies all conditions is:
   1. S (nutrition)
   2. Y (wildlife)
   3. J (finance) 
   4. G (finance)
   5. Q (nutrition)
   6. H (finance)
   7. R (nutrition)
4. In this ordering, H is sixth. Therefore, choice A ""H is fifth"" cannot be true.
5. However, choice B ""J is first"" could be true, as demonstrated in the possible ordering above.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the information provided:
1. The third solo must be a traditional piece, but it could be performed by either Wayne or Zara.
2. Two traditional pieces must be performed consecutively. This means either the second and third solos are traditional, or the third and fourth solos are traditional.
3. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. If the third and fourth solos are traditional, Wayne could perform the fourth solo as a traditional piece, but he doesn't have to.
4. No traditional piece can be performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece. This means Wayne must perform a modern piece in the first or second solo.
5. One possible scenario that satisfies all conditions is:
   - First solo: Wayne performs a modern piece 
   - Second solo: Zara performs a modern piece
   - Third solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - Fourth solo: Zara performs a traditional piece
   - Fifth solo: Wayne performs a modern piece
6. In this scenario, Wayne performs zero traditional pieces, which is the minimum possible number that satisfies all the conditions.
Therefore, the minimum number of solos in which Wayne performs a traditional piece is zero.

2. Megregian reviews more plays than both Kramer and Lopez. 
3. Jiang cannot review Tamerlane, because neither Lopez nor Megregian can review any play that Jiang reviews.
4. If Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, then to satisfy the condition that Megregian reviews more plays than Lopez, Megregian would also have to review Tamerlane. However, the correct answer from my previous reflection includes Megregian but not Lopez reviewing Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez does not review Tamerlane.

1. The panel already includes F (botanist), L (chemist), Q (zoologist), and R (zoologist).
2. The panel must include at least one scientist of each type. This condition is already satisfied with F (botanist), L (chemist), Q and R (zoologists).
3. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. There is only one botanist (F) selected, so this condition allows for the selection of another zoologist. 
4. F and K cannot both be selected. This is satisfied as K is not currently selected.
5. K and M cannot both be selected. Again, this is satisfied as neither K nor M are currently selected.
6. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. M is not selected, so this condition does not apply.

1. We know L is on a higher shelf than H. And O is on a higher shelf than L. So the order from top to bottom must be: O, L, H. 
2. I is on the middle shelf.
3. K is on a higher shelf than F. And F is on the same shelf as M. So F and M must be on the bottom shelf (since the middle shelf is taken by I). This puts K on the top shelf.
4. So far we have:
   Top: O, K

  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know Y (wildlife) is in position 4. This means positions 3 and 5 cannot be wildlife articles.
2. S (nutrition) must be earlier than Y. So S must be in position 1, 2, or 3. 
3. If S is in position 3, then Q (also nutrition) must be in position 1, because consecutive articles can't cover the same topic, and S can only be earlier than Q if Q is third.
4. J (finance) must be earlier than G (finance), and G must be earlier than R (nutrition).
5. If S is in position 1, then a finance article (H or J) must be in position 2 to avoid consecutive nutrition articles. Then J must be in position 3 to avoid consecutive finance articles and to be before G. This satisfies all conditions.
6. If S is in position 2, then Q must be in position 1 to avoid S being earlier than Q when Q is not third. Then J must be in position 3 for the same reasons as above. This also satisfies all conditions.
7. However, if S is in position 3, then Q must be in position 1 or 2. But this would mean that either G or H (finance) must be in position 5, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R (nutrition).
Therefore, the only consistent scenarios are when J is in position 3.

  E: Rottweilers are featured on exactly three days.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they can't be featured on days 2, 6, or 7. This eliminates choice A.
2. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1 or 7. So they must be featured on three of the days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 
3. Rottweilers can't be featured on the same day as Himalayans, or on day 7. This eliminates choice E, since Rottweilers can be featured on at most 2 days (the 2 days not taken by Himalayans out of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
4. If Rottweilers were featured only on day 3 (choice D), then Himalayans could be featured on days 2, 4, and 5 or 6. This satisfies all the constraints.
5. If Rottweilers were featured on day 6 (choice C), then Himalayans would have to be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or 5. But this would mean Rottweilers are featured on more than one day (day 3 and day 6), contradicting choice C.

","You're right, upon further reflection I see that Theresa cannot test bicycle F on the second day no matter what. Here's the reasoning:
1. Theresa must test bicycle H on either the first or second day. 
2. If Theresa tests H on the first day:
   - The other 3 riders test F, G and J on the first day
   - On the second day, those same 3 bicycles (F, G, J) must be tested by the 3 riders other than Theresa
   - So Theresa cannot test F, G or J on the second day. She must test the remaining bicycle.
3. If Theresa tests H on the second day:
   - She obviously cannot also test F on the second day, since she's already testing H
Therefore, regardless of whether Theresa tests H on day 1 or day 2, she cannot possibly test F on the second day. Choice C is the only option that cannot be true.

2. Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone. They can't be in Zone 1, because then either Parra or Quinn would have to be in Zone 1 too. They also can't be in Zone 2, because then Zone 2 would have at least as many representatives as Zone 3. So Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3.
3. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Since Udall is in Zone 3, Tiao must be in Zone 2.
4. Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Parra is in Zone 3 and Tiao is in Zone 2, Kim or Mahr must be in Zone 1.
Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list for Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.

","Based on the problem constraints and my previous reflection, here is my thought process:
1. The pharmacy must be at one end, and a restaurant at the other end.
2. The optometrist is next to the shoe store. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or veterinarian, it must be next to the optometrist in this case. 
3. So the arrangement is:
   Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - ? - ? - ? - Restaurant
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses. The second restaurant could be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
5. The toy store can't be next to the veterinarian. 
6. This leaves two possible full arrangements:
   a) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Restaurant - Toy Store - Veterinarian - Restaurant 
   b) Pharmacy - Optometrist - Shoe Store - Toy Store - Restaurant - Veterinarian - Restaurant
7. In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.

1. Kramer and O'Neill both only review Tamerlane, as they are the two students who review exactly the same play(s).
2. Megregian must review at least two plays, as Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
3. If exactly three students review Undulation, it must be either Jiang or Megregian (but not both), plus two others, as neither Lopez nor Megregian can review a play that Jiang reviews.
4. If Jiang reviews Undulation:
   - Megregian cannot review Undulation, so he must review both Sunset and Tamerlane to have at least two plays. 
   - Lopez can review either Sunset or Tamerlane or both.
5. If Megregian reviews Undulation:
   - Jiang cannot review Undulation, so he must review Sunset. 
   - Lopez can review either Sunset or Tamerlane or both.
6. Looking at the answer choices:
   - A, B, C, and D could all be true in some scenario.

1. We know that either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, must be assigned an ambassadorship.
2. If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned. Conversely, if Jaramillo is not assigned, then Kayne cannot be assigned.
3. If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen. 
4. If Landon is assigned, it must be to Zambia.
5. From the reflection, we see that if Jaramillo is not assigned, then Kayne is also not assigned (from point 2). This means Novetzke must be assigned (from point 1).
6. If Novetzke and Landon are assigned, Landon must be assigned to Zambia (from point 4), and Novetzke must be assigned to Venezuela or Yemen.
7. This leaves Ong to be assigned to the remaining country (Venezuela or Yemen).
8. Therefore, if Jaramillo is not assigned, Kayne must also be unassigned, and the other three candidates must be assigned. So the only possible pair of unassigned candidates is Jaramillo and Kayne.

2. Young must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Robertson. Since Robertson can only be assigned #1, #2, #3, or #4, Young must be assigned #1, #2, or #3. 
3. Togowa must be assigned a lower-numbered parking space than Young. Since Young can only be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Togowa must be assigned #1 or #2.
4. Since Togowa is limited to #1 or #2, this further limits Young to #2 or #3.
5. Since Young is limited to #2 or #3, this further limits Robertson to #3 or #4.
6. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. This doesn't limit Xu or Souza to specific spaces yet.
7. Looking at the employees individually:
   - Robertson: must be assigned #3 or #4 (limited to 2 spaces)

   - Togowa: must be assigned #1 or #2 (limited to 2 spaces)
   - Vaughn: no specific limitation
   - Xu: no specific limitation

4. However, only one of Solide or Truvest can have the 3-day voicemail target. If one has a 3-day voicemail target, it must also have a 3-day website target (to satisfy the condition that no website target is longer than the voicemail target).
5. Therefore, the 3-day website target is the only target that cannot be set for more than one client. All other targets could potentially be assigned to multiple clients.

  B: Solide's website target is shorter than Image's.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.

  C: Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's.
  D: Truvest's website target is shorter than Image's.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is shorter than Solide's.
","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. We know that none of the clients can have a website target longer than its voicemail target.
2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So Image must have the 1 day voicemail target.
3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. 
4. We're told that none of the clients has a website target of 2 days. So the website targets must be either 1 day or 3 days.
5. If Image's website target is 1 day (to be less than its 1 day voicemail target), then Solide and Truvest must have 3 day website targets (since 2 days is not an option).
6. With Image having a 1 day voicemail target, Solide could have a 2 day voicemail target, and Truvest a 3 day voicemail target. This satisfies all the conditions.
7. Looking at the choices:
   A. Image's website target can't be shorter than Solide's if Solide's is 3 days and Image's is 1 day.
   B. This is possible with the scenario outlined above.
   C. Solide's voicemail target can't be shorter than Truvest's based on condition 2.
   D. Truvest's website target can't be shorter than Image's based on condition 3.
   E. Truvest's voicemail target could be longer than Solide's, not shorter.
Therefore, the only choice that could be true is B.

  B: The pharmacy is in space 7.
  C: A restaurant is in space 4.
  D: The shoe store is in space 6.
  E: The toy store is in space 3.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step given the new information:
1. The veterinarian is in space 5.
2. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the veterinarian is in space 5, the pharmacy must be in space 6 or space 4.
3. However, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, with a restaurant at the other end. This means the pharmacy must actually be in space 7, and a restaurant must be in space 1.
4. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. With a restaurant in space 1, the second restaurant could be in space 4 or space 6. 
5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian in space 5. So the toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
6. Looking at the answer choices:
   A. We don't know where the optometrist is. 
   B. Yes, the pharmacy must be in space 7.
   C. The second restaurant could be in space 4 or 6, but it doesn't have to be in space 4.
   D. We don't know where the shoe store is.
   E. The toy store cannot be in space 3 next to the veterinarian.
Therefore, the only statement that must be true is B - the pharmacy is in space 7.

Choices:
  A: fuel, machinery, textiles
  B: grain, machinery, fuel
  C: machinery, livestock, fuel
  D: machinery, textiles, fuel
  E: machinery, textiles, produce
","Choices:
  A: fuel, machinery, textiles
  B: grain, machinery, fuel
  C: machinery, livestock, fuel
  D: machinery, textiles, fuel
  E: machinery, textiles, produce
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step using the information provided:
1. From the first two conditions, we can deduce the relative order of grain, livestock, and textiles:
   textiles < livestock < grain
2. From the third condition, we know: 
   fuel < produce
3. The fourth condition tells us that textiles and produce are in adjacent bays.
4. Looking at just the first three bays (1-3), the only arrangement that fits with the deduced ordering so far is:
   textiles, produce, fuel
   This is because:
   - Textiles must be before livestock and grain
   - Produce must be after fuel
   - Textiles and produce must be adjacent
5. This arrangement matches answer choice E: machinery, textiles, produce
Therefore, the cargo in bays 1-3 must be machinery, textiles, and produce, in that order.

1. The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday.
2. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. 
3. No two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day.
4. At least one batch of cookies must be made on Monday. Given the constraints, this must be the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
5. The first batch of sugar cookies can only be made on Monday or Wednesday, since the second batch is on Thursday and no two batches of the same kind can be made on the same day.
6. The second and third batches of peanut butter cookies, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies, must be made on either Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.
Considering the choices:
A) Two different first batches could be made on Monday (oatmeal and sugar). This is possible.
B) Two different first batches are already made on Tuesday (peanut butter and oatmeal). This is true.
C) Only the second batch of sugar cookies could potentially be made on Wednesday. Two different second batches is not possible. This is the exception.
D) The second batches of peanut butter and sugar cookies could both be made on Thursday. This is possible. 
E) The third batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies could both be made on Friday. This is possible.
