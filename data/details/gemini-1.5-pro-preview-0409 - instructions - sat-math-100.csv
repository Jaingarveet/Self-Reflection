Choices:
  A: I only

","Choices:
  A: I only
  B: II only
  C: I and II
  D: Neither I nor II
","Thought:
Following the instructions:
1. **Solve algebraically:**
Squaring both sides: $(\sqrt{4x})^2 = (x-3)^2$
This simplifies to: $4x = x^2 - 6x + 9$
Rearranging: $x^2 - 10x + 9 = 0$
Factoring: $(x-1)(x-9) = 0$
Potential solutions: $x=1$ and $x=9$
2. **Substitute and verify:**
- For $x=1$: $\sqrt{4(1)} = 2$, but $1-3 = -2$. So, $x=1$ is NOT a solution (extraneous). 
- For $x=9$: $\sqrt{4(9)} = 6$, and $9-3 = 6$. So, $x=9$ IS a solution.
3. **Valid solution:** Only $x=9$
Action: Answer(""B"") 
","Choice B is correct. Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{4 x}=x-3$ yields $4 x=(x-3)^{2}$, or $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$. Applying the distributive property on the right-hand side of the equation $4 x=(x-3)(x-3)$ yields $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$. Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$. Factoring the right-hand side of $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$ gives $0=(x-1)(x-9)$. By the zero product property, if $0=(x-1)(x-9)$, then $0=x-1$ or $0=x-9$. Adding 1 to both sides of $0=x-1$ gives $x=1$. Adding 9 to both sides of $0=x-9$ gives $x=9$. Substituting these values for $x$ into the given equation will determine whether they satisfy the equation. Substituting 1 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\sqrt{4(1)}=1-3$, or $\sqrt{4}=-2$, which is false. Therefore, $x=1$ doesn't satisfy the given equation. Substituting 9 for $x$ in the given equation yields $\sqrt{4(9)}=9-3$ or $\sqrt{36}=6$, which is true. Therefore, $x=9$ satisfies the given equation.Choices $\mathrm{A}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect because $x=1$ doesn't satisfy the given equation: $\sqrt{4 x}$ represents the principal square root of $4 x$, which can't be negative. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because $x=9$ does satisfy the given equation.",B,B,1,441,221,662,
