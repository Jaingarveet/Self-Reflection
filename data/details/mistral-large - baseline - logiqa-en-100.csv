Choice C is not relevant to the argument, as it discusses real estate speculation within China, not abroad.

Option A suggests that residents are keeping their funds available to buy goods as prices continue to rise. However, this does not explain why the funds are flowing out of savings deposits.

From the given information, we can deduce the following:

1. The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2. The finance department is next to the planning department.
3. The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.

Let's try to arrange the departments based on this information.

Since the finance department is next to the planning department, we can rule out options C and D, as they do not have the finance and planning departments adjacent.

Now, let's consider options A and B. In both options, the finance department is next to the planning department, and the administration department is above the planning department. However, in option A, the human resources department is adjacent to the sales department, which contradicts the given information.

Therefore, the correct answer must be option B.

To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts or undermines the assumption that the newly built house is a small property house or that small property houses are not protected by law.

Option A weakens the argument by suggesting that the house has been tacitly approved by relevant departments, which implies that it may be subject to some form of protection.
Option B does not weaken the argument because it confirms that the house is a small property house, which is not protected by law.
Option C does not weaken the argument because it does not contradict the assumption that the house is a small property house or that small property houses are not protected by law.

Choice B does not support the argument because it suggests that ethical regulations are absolute and not subject to variation.
Choice C supports the argument by suggesting that rules or standards are always behind judgments of right and wrong.
Choice D does not support the argument because it suggests that moral regulations vary from person to person and from place to place, which contradicts the idea that regulations can be inherently wrong or not wrong.

Choices:
  A: ""Artificial"" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective
  B: It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition
  C: Gene screening is mainly to avoid reproductive defects, this technology brings opportunities for human eugenics and eugenics; as for ""customized babies"", the concept of cloning is more involved, the two should not be confused
  D: ""Customized babies"" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics

  D: ""Customized babies"" have not been tried globally, this concept also challenges the most controversial human reproductive ethics
","Thought:
The views of ordinary people, as stated in the context, is that humans may usher in the era of ""customized babies"" due to the advent of next-generation gene sequencing technology.
To refute this view, we need to find a statement that shows that this technology does not necessarily lead to the creation of ""customized babies"".
Choice C states that gene screening is mainly used to avoid reproductive defects and that the concept of ""customized babies"" is more related to cloning. This statement distinguishes between the two concepts and shows that gene sequencing technology does not necessarily lead to ""customized babies"".

From the choices, only A and C have Q in the middle of Team 1.
L must be in Team 1 (condition 3), so choice C is not valid.
N cannot be in the same team as K (condition 4), so choice A is not valid.
Action: Answer(""None of the Above"")

Correction:
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the instructions and provided an answer that was not one of the available choices. Here is the correct answer:

Thought:
If H is in Team 2, Q must be in the middle of Team 1 (condition 6).
From the choices, only A and C have Q in the middle of Team 1.
L must be in Team 1 (condition 3), so choice C is not valid.
N cannot be in the same team as K (condition 4), but K is not in Team 1 in choice A.
Therefore, choice A is valid.
