The space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its length can be calculated by multiplying its speed by the time it takes to pass the point.
The speed of the space shuttle is not given in the question, but we can calculate it using the information provided: it travels 700m high in 40 seconds.
So, the speed of the space shuttle is 700m / 40s = 17.5m/s.
The length of the space shuttle is then 17.5m/s \* 5s = 87.5m.
However, none of the available choices match this answer.
I must have made a mistake in my calculation or interpretation of the question.
Let me double-check my calculations and make sure I am using the correct formula.

Action: Answer(""E"")

Explanation:
I made a mistake in my initial calculation.
The speed of the space shuttle is not relevant to the question.
The question asks for the length of the space shuttle, which can be calculated by multiplying its speed by the time it takes to pass a point.
The speed of the space shuttle is not given in the question, but we can calculate it using the information provided: it travels 700m high in 40 seconds.
So, the speed of the space shuttle is 700m / 40s = 17.5m/s.
However, this information is not useful for calculating the length of the space shuttle.
Instead, we can use the fact that the space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point.
This means that the length of the space shuttle is equal to the distance it travels in 5 seconds.
Since the speed of the space shuttle is 17.5m/s, the distance it travels in 5 seconds is 17.5m/s \* 5s = 87.5m.
However, none of the available choices match this answer.
The closest answer is 150m, which is choice E.
Therefore, I will select choice E as the best answer.

Error: Misinterpretation of the question and calculation error

Correct Answer: E

Explanation:
I misinterpreted the question and made a calculation error.
The gap in my knowledge was not in math but in understanding the question.
I knew the correct formula for calculating the length of the space shuttle but misinterpreted the question and made a calculation error.

Error Keywords:
 - Misinterpretation of the question
 - Calculation error
 - Speed calculation error

Solution:
The length of the space shuttle can be calculated by multiplying its speed by the time it takes to pass a point.
The speed of the space shuttle is not given in the question, but we can calculate it using the information provided: it travels 700m high in 40 seconds.
So, the speed of the space shuttle is 700m / 40s = 17.5m/s.
However, this information is not useful for calculating the length of the space shuttle.
Instead, we can use the fact that the space shuttle takes 5 seconds to pass a point.
This means that the length of the space shuttle is equal to the distance it travels in 5 seconds.
Since the speed of the space shuttle is 17.5m/s, the distance it travels in 5 seconds is 17.5m/s \* 5s = 87.5m.
However, none of the available choices match this answer.
The closest answer is 150m, which is choice E.
Therefore, I will select choice E as the best answer.

Instructions:
1. Identify the information given in the question.
2. Identify the formula for calculating the length of the space shuttle.
3. Calculate the speed of the space shuttle using the information provided.
4. Use the speed of the space shuttle and the time it takes to pass a point to calculate its length.

Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, the remaining students who can give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report, so he must give the morning report on Tuesday.
Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, but they can give a morning report.
If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Since Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday (since she cannot give an afternoon report), if she gives a report on Monday morning, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, respectively. However, this would mean that Olivia and Robert cannot give reports, which contradicts the conditions. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday morning.
The only remaining option for Monday morning is Olivia.
Since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, Irving must give the afternoon report on Monday.
Since Helen and Irving must both give reports if Nina gives a report, and Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday, Nina must give the afternoon report on Wednesday.

  E: There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer.
","Thought:
The information provided states that different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins found in cats' skin secretions and saliva. It also states that all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, so there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions. However, it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats.

Based on this information, we can infer that not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva, since some cats may cause an allergic reaction in some allergy sufferers but not in others. We can also infer that no cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers, since different allergy sufferers are allergic to different proteins.

The passage states that no crops were planted in the pilot experiments to avoid competition with emerging weeds. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips, the crops would have competed with the weeds for resources such as water, nutrients, and sunlight, potentially reducing the percentage of the surface covered with weeds.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",A,A,1,1875,80,1955,

","Thought:
Expanding the given equation, we get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing this to $15 x^{2}+c x+14$, we can see that $a b=15$ and $7 a+2 b=c$.
Since $a+b=8$, we can write $b=8-a$.
Substituting this into the equation for $a b$, we get $a(8-a)=15$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a=3$ or $a=5$.
Substituting these values into the equation for $c$, we get $c=31$ or $c=41$.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is correct. One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$. Since $(a x+2)(b x+7)=15 x^{2}+c x+14$, one can expand the left side of the equation to obtain $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14=15 x^{2}+c x+14$. Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 . Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 31 and 41 .Choice $A$ is incorrect; the numbers 3 and 5 are possible values for $a$ and $b$, but not possible values for $c$. Choice $B$ is incorrect; if $a=5$ and $b=3$, then 6 and 35 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(5 x+2)(3 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+35 x+6 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 6 and 35, the value of $c$ is 41 and not 6 and 35. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect; if $a=3$ and $b=5$, then 10 and 21 are the coefficients of $x$ when the expression $(3 x+2)(5 x+7)$ is expanded as $15 x^{2}+21 x+10 x+14$. However, when the coefficients of $x$ are 10 and 21 , the value of $c$ is 31 and not 10 and 21 .",D,D,1,866,170,1036,

The addition of acids to create a ball of food (choice A) is a physical change because it does not change the chemical composition of the food. The secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides (choice B) is a chemical change because it involves breaking down proteins into smaller peptides, resulting in a change in chemical composition.
