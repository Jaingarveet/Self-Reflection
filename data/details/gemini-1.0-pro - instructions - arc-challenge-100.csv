  C: The components retain their original properties.
  D: The components chemically combine with each other.
","## Self-Reflection:
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** I incorrectly answered that the snack was a mixture because it was made up of more than one substance.
**Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:** I focused solely on the fact that the snack contained multiple ingredients, overlooking the crucial aspect of whether those ingredients retained their individual properties.
**Correct Answer:** The snack is a mixture because the components (peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces) retain their original properties and can be physically separated.
**Key Learning:** Mixtures are defined by the retention of individual properties and the possibility of physical separation, not just the presence of multiple substances.
## Applying the Learning:
In the given scenario, each component of the snack retains its distinct characteristics. Peanuts remain peanuts, sunflower seeds remain sunflower seeds, and so on. Additionally, these components can be physically separated through methods like picking, sifting, or sorting.
Therefore, the snack is classified as a mixture.

**Explanation:**
Glass bottles can be reused many times without losing their quality or integrity. This makes them a more sustainable option compared to other materials that can only be recycled a limited number of times or not at all.
**Additional Information:**
* Steel cans can also be recycled multiple times, but the process is more energy-intensive than recycling glass.
* Paper containers can be recycled, but the fibers become weaker with each cycle, limiting the number of times they can be reused.

","Choices:
  A: by tossing a ball in the air
  B: by shaking the ends of a rope
  C: by throwing a pebble into a pool of water
  D: by pulling on a coiled spring toy
","## Self-Reflection
**Previous Incorrect Answer:** C
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that throwing a pebble into a pool of water would not generate a wave because the water is not a solid medium. However, water is a liquid and can support the propagation of waves.
**Correct Answer:** B
**Reasoning:** Shaking the ends of a rope does not generate a wave because it does not involve the transfer of energy through a medium. A rope is a solid object, and the vibrations caused by shaking the ends do not propagate through the rope as a wave.
**Steps to Solve the Problem:**
1. **Identify the type of wave:** The question asks about generating a wave, without specifying the type. Therefore, we can assume that the question refers to any type of wave, including mechanical waves (such as sound waves and water waves) and electromagnetic waves (such as light waves and radio waves).
2. **Determine if the wave requires a medium:** All mechanical waves require a medium to travel through. Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand, can travel through a vacuum.
3. **Identify the medium involved:** In the case of throwing a ball in the air, the medium is air. In the case of throwing a pebble into a pool of water, the medium is water. In the case of pulling on a coiled spring toy, the medium is the spring itself.
4. **Consider the actions described in each answer choice:**
    - Tossing a ball in the air creates a sound wave in the air.
    - Shaking the ends of a rope does not generate a wave.
    - Throwing a pebble into a pool of water creates a water wave.
    - Pulling on a coiled spring toy creates a mechanical wave in the spring.
5. **Determine which action would not generate the type of wave identified in step 1:** Shaking the ends of a rope does not generate a wave because it does not involve the transfer of energy through a medium.

Hirta has plenty of grass for the sheep to eat, and no natural predators of the sheep live on the island. Some sheep have dark wool, and some have light wool. The sheep with dark wool tend to be much larger and stronger than the sheep with light wool. However, researchers have found that in the last 20 years, the sheep with light wool have increased in number. Usually, strength and size help animals survive and breed. A new sheep predator is introduced to the island. Which change to the sheep population will most likely occur first?
Choices:

  A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
  B: a decrease in the population of sheep with light wool
  C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
  D: an increase in the population of sheep with light wool
","## Self-Reflection on Previous Incorrect Answer:
**My previous answer:** C: an increase in the population of sheep with dark wool
**Reasoning:** I incorrectly assumed that the dark wool sheep's strength and size would give them an advantage against the new predator.
**Correct answer:** A: a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool
**Reasoning:** The new predator will likely target the larger and stronger dark wool sheep, as they are easier to catch and provide more food. This will lead to a decrease in the population of dark wool sheep.
## Applying the Reflection to the Current Question:
**Key factors:**
* Predator introduction: This will increase predation pressure on the sheep population.
* Wool color: Dark wool sheep are larger and stronger, but light wool sheep have been increasing in number.
* Predator's prey selection: The predator will likely target the easier prey, which are the larger and stronger dark wool sheep.
**Analysis:**
* The historical trend shows an increase in the light wool sheep population, suggesting they have a survival advantage.
* The new predator will likely target the dark wool sheep due to their size and strength, making them easier to catch.
**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the most likely population change is a decrease in the population of sheep with dark wool (choice A).

* **Made of tissues:** Organs are composed of multiple types of tissues that work together to perform a specific function.
* **Specific function:** Each organ has a unique and essential role in the body.
* **Part of an organism:** Organs are integrated into the body and work in conjunction with other organs to maintain overall health.
