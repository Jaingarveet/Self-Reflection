  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step based on the passage:
1. The third paragraph discusses critics of the second version of multicultural education. 
2. These critics argue that the second version, while claiming to be neutral, still examines cultures using Western scientific methods like anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
3. The critics say these Western scientific methods are value-laden, prizing objectivity, logic, and empirical verification over subjectivity, intuition, and mysticism which are more dominant in non-Western cultures.
4. Therefore, the critics argue, studying non-scientific cultures with Western scientific methods is distorting and an attempt to maintain Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
5. The critics believe real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting that culture's own, often non-scientific, perspectives and methods.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) Comparing moral codes would not necessarily be objectionable, as it doesn't specify a scientific Western methodology.
B) Studying a culture's literature to understand its values uses the culture's own discourse, which the critics advocate.
C) This directly matches the critics' objection - using Western scientific methods to study a non-scientific culture. The critics would find this objectionable.
D) Using one culture's theories to criticize another's literature based on differing values aligns with the critics' view that each culture must be understood on its own terms.
E) The critics discuss Western culture imposing its methods on others, not the reverse, so they may not object to this.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage presents three positions on the role of literature:
   - Art stands above everyday reality 
   - Art must depict concrete reality and contribute to social change
   - Dostoyevsky's view that reality shaped by the perceiver is literature's source
2. The first two positions are stated but not elaborated in detail. They mainly serve to set up the contrast with Dostoyevsky's view.
3. The majority of the passage is devoted to explaining Dostoyevsky's position in depth:
   - His view of the relationship between fantasy and reality
   - His rejection of the radical critics' utilitarian view of art
   - His definition of what makes a work ""artistic""  
   - His belief that art's usefulness can't always be precisely measured
4. The passage differentiates Dostoyevsky's view from the other two, especially the radical critics' stance, but does not argue it is superior. 
5. Looking at the answer choices, B seems to best capture the structure: 
   Three positions are presented, and the third (Dostoyevsky's) is differentiated from the first two in detail.
The passage does not equally elaborate all three views (ruling out A), and does not focus on comparing the third view solely to the second (ruling out C). It also does not argue for the superiority or inferiority of any view (ruling out D and E).

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Both passages discuss the reliability and validity of fingerprint evidence from different perspectives. Passage A argues that fingerprint evidence is reliable despite a lack of uniform standards, while Passage B argues that fingerprint evidence is unreliable because of a lack of objective standards and unknown error rates.
2. However, both passages seem to agree on a key underlying point - that to properly evaluate the reliability of fingerprint evidence, we need to know the likelihood of false matches occurring. 
3. Passage A states ""The trial court below was therefore within its discretion in crediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate."" This implies the court found the error rate important for assessing reliability.
4. Passage B states more explicitly: ""How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? ... No fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence.""
5. So while the passages reach different conclusions, they both rely on the premise that knowing the probability of false matches is essential for determining the reliability of fingerprint evidence.

  D: pleased that it does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers
  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage introduces the idea that defense lawyers have a ""twofold obligation: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society."" (lines 20-23)
2. The author argues that because of this twofold obligation, lawyers should not present assertions to the court that they know to be false, even if it would help their client's case. 
3. The author believes this twofold obligation ultimately benefits defendants, because ""the 'best defense' can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case.""
4. This suggests the author is confident that the twofold obligation enables lawyers to balance their responsibilities to both their clients and the court/society. The obligation ensures lawyers provide a strong defense when merited, but not at the expense of their duty to the court.
5. The other choices are not strongly supported by the passage:
   - B is too extreme - the author allows that lawyers can defend guilty clients, just not falsely
   - C and D are not the main focus of the author's argument about the twofold obligation
   - E is the opposite of the author's view - the twofold obligation does create somewhat competing responsibilities

  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step based on the details provided in the passage:
The passage states that in the 1930s, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating atoms could in principle be split apart. However, when experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons were conducted, the researchers were not receptive to the possibility that atoms were actually being split in that context. 
The passage notes ""A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse."" This suggests the physics community at the time did not expect atoms to be split by the neutron bombardment experiments.
The passage also indicates the physics community had difficulty identifying the substances produced by the neutron bombardment, expecting them to be elements close to uranium. It was not until 1938 that Otto Hahn conclusively identified barium as one of the resulting substances. 
Finally, the passage states that once Lise Meitner recognized the atoms were actually being split and coined the term ""nuclear fission"", it became clear the relevant evidence had been present for some time, just lacking the right conceptual link.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: The passage suggests the physics community neglected earlier theoretical calculations about splitting atoms in the context of the neutron bombardment experiments. This seems to be supported by the information provided.
B, C, D and E: The passage does not provide clear evidence that the physics community reevaluated earlier calculations (B), never identified the by-products (C), showed uranium was easiest to split (D), or recognized dangers of radioactive substances (E).

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The author's main argument seems to be that a new digital publishing model is likely to eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing. This is due to the economic efficiency and convenience of the digital model.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) The author doesn't really discuss changing literary tastes of consumers. The focus is more on the publishing model itself.
B) The author does mention that keeping books ""in print"" digitally will allow purchasing from a ""practically limitless digital catalog"". However, this is portrayed more as a feature of the digital model, not the primary driver of its acceptance. 
C) The author discusses demands of literary agents for higher author royalties. But this is described more as a consequence of the transition to the digital model, not the main impetus for completing it.
D) Innovative marketing strategies are not discussed by the author as a factor.
E) The author doesn't focus on familiarity with information storage as a reason for accepting the digital model.
Reviewing the passage again, the author's key point seems to be that the economic advantages of digital publishing, like lower costs and higher efficiency, make its eventual dominance likely. This is best captured by the statement ""Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishing.""
Therefore, I would infer that the author sees the inherent economic advantages of the digital model as the primary driver of its likely acceptance, rather than the other factors mentioned.

1. Passage A focuses on a specific court case and the defendant's challenge to fingerprint evidence used against him. It discusses the court's reasoning for rejecting the defendant's challenge.
2. In contrast, Passage B takes a broader look at issues with fingerprint identification in general. It points out the lack of objective standards, unknown probability of matches, and limited study of error rates in the field as a whole.
3. So while Passage A is centered on a particular legal case, Passage B examines problems with fingerprint analysis more universally, without reference to any one case.
4. This means that relative to Passage A, Passage B is more general in its focus. It looks at fingerprint examination through a wider lens.
5. The other options don't accurately capture the key difference:
- Optimism/tentativeness relate more to tone than scope 
- Respect for opposing claims isn't the main distinction
- Unsubstantiated assumptions are discussed in B but aren't the primary difference in focus

  E: The emphasis within Mexican American communities on teaching children about peer-group relationships distinguishes those communities from other communities within the United States.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The passage defines proverbs as self-contained sayings that carry wisdom or a message, and can be understood independent of a specific verbal context. This matches choice D.
The passage then discusses how proverb use among Mexican Americans serves to:
1) Instruct the young, especially regarding peer relationships 
2) Foster ethnic consciousness and maintain ties to Mexican culture and heritage
While choice B mentions conveying ethnicity to children, the passage indicates this is done through proverbs in general, not necessarily through frequent use. The frequency point is more tied to instruction.

The sentence in lines 7-11 states:
""They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.""
This is reporting the view of some legal scholars, not the author's own opinion.
The sentences in lines 28-31 state: 
""In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent.""
This appears to be the author expressing their own view.
Comparing the ideas:
- Lines 7-11 say lawyers should not judge guilt/innocence, only represent the defendant 
- Lines 28-31 say if the lawyer believes the client may be innocent, they should try to prove innocence
- So lines 28-31 disagree with the view reported in lines 7-11 by saying lawyers should make a judgment about possible innocence

1. The passage discusses the conflict between two economic concepts - the Pin Factory (representing increasing returns to scale) and the Invisible Hand (representing the benefits of competition in a free market).
2. It mentions that economists struggled for a long time to mathematically model the concept of increasing returns, which the Pin Factory represents. 
3. The reference to railroads is given as an example of an industry that has increasing returns to scale, i.e. characteristics of the Pin Factory.
4. The passage states ""Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads.""
5. This suggests that railroads are mentioned to illustrate a type of industry where the Pin Factory concept applies, but which economists struggled to model mathematically for a long time.
Looking at the answer choices:
A, D and E don't seem to fit with how railroads are discussed in the passage. 
B and C both relate to the Pin Factory concept, but C directly matches the purpose of mentioning railroads according to the passage - to point out an industry that has characteristics of increasing returns to scale, which the Pin Factory represents.

  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in the criticism of the second version of multicultural education are:
1) The methods used (anthropology, social psychology, etc.) are based on Western scientific values like objectivity. 
2) Insisting on using these methods to understand non-scientific cultures is distorting and Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
3) Real understanding requires adopting the native, often non-scientific perspectives of the cultures being studied.
To provide the strongest objection, we need to find a statement that challenges one of these core assumptions or conclusions. Let's examine each answer choice:
A) Whether it's possible to truly adopt another culture's perspective as an outsider is tangential to the main argument. This doesn't directly challenge the criticism.
B) The similarity or dissimilarity between non-Western value systems is not relevant to the key issue of whether Western scientific methods distort the understanding of those cultures. 
C) This is the strongest objection. If some non-Western societies themselves use their own values to study other cultures, that undermines the claim that doing so is necessarily distorting or an expression of cultural chauvinism. It challenges a key assumption of the criticism.
D) The achievements of Western culture and how to best understand them are not the subject of the passage. This point is irrelevant to evaluating the criticism presented.
E) The necessity of genuine cultural understanding to appreciate a culture is not disputed by the criticism and is in fact a premise of its argument. Stating this does not challenge the reasoning of the criticism.
Therefore, C provides the strongest objection by showing a counterexample to the criticism's claim that studying a culture through an outside value system is inherently distorting and chauvinistic.
