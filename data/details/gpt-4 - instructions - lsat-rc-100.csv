The third paragraph discusses a version of multicultural education that criticizes the use of Western scientific methods to study non-Western, often nonscientific cultures. The proponents of this version argue that using Western scientific methods distorts the understanding of these cultures and is an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. Therefore, they would most likely object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.

","Thought: 
The author's argument is that increased size leads to monopoly power because larger businesses can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than smaller businesses. This means that larger businesses can drive smaller ones out of business, leading to a monopoly. The question asks for a choice that would undermine this connection. 
Choice A does not undermine the connection because it still implies that larger businesses can exert monopoly power. 
Choice B is irrelevant to the connection between size and monopoly power. 
Choice C does not undermine the connection because it still implies that a few large businesses can dominate an industry and set high prices. 
Choice D undermines the connection because it suggests that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale (and hence potentially become a monopoly) varies widely, implying that not all large businesses will necessarily become monopolies. 
Choice E is irrelevant to the connection between size and monopoly power.

The author believes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court, and if they are convinced of their client's guilt, they should not try to demonstrate innocence.
