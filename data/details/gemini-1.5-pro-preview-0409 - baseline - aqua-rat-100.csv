","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).

Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)

1. **Combined Rate:** Alex makes 1 toy in 7 hours, Jacob in 9 hours. So, their combined rate is 1/7 + 1/9 = 16/63 toys per hour.
2. **Total Time:** They made 35 toys. To find the total time, we divide the total toys by their combined rate: 35 toys / (16/63 toys/hour) = 137.81 hours.
3. **Jacob's Time:** Since they worked similar hours, Jacob worked approximately half of the total time: 137.81 hours / 2 = 68.9 hours.
4. **Jacob's Toys:** To find how many toys Jacob made, we multiply his time by his rate: 68.9 hours * (1/9 toys/hour) = 7.65 toys.
5. **Rounding:** Since Jacob can't make a fraction of a toy, we round to the nearest whole number. 
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs. and y is 135 hrs. Thus total toys created by Jacob = y/9 = 135/9 = 15.

","Thought:
Let the speed of the car be v and the height of the tower be h. 
Let the distances of the car from the base of the tower at the two instances of observations be x and y respectively.
Then, tan 60° = h/y and tan 45° = h/x
This gives us y = h/√3 and x = h
The distance covered in 10 minutes = x – y = h(1 – 1/√3)
The time taken to cover the remaining distance y = (h/√3)/v = h/(√3v) = 10/(√3 – 1) minutes
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h. Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).
Now, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.
tan 60 = h/x x = h/√3
So, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.
10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)
h can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).
To travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :
h = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)
h / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)
So, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.

The outer cube has dimensions 5x5x5. 
Removing the outer layer leaves a 3x3x3 cube.
The number of small cubes in the 3x3x3 cube is 27.
Each small cube has 6 faces, so there are 27 * 6 = 162 faces.
Action: Answer(""E"") 
","Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L3 = 5*5*5 = 125 cm3
Size of hollow cube (considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3*3*3 = 27 cm3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1*1*1 = 1 cm3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes (6 faces each cube has) = 98*6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6*L2 = 6*5*5 = 150cm2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1*1 = 1cm2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150/1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted= 588-150

","It is given that Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her own weight.
It means that 29 Kgs is the other half. So she weighs 58 Kgs.

  D: 4 hour and 31 minutes

","Thought:
First, we need to find the time each ball takes to complete one full rotation:
* Ball A: 26 minutes / 2 rotations = 13 minutes/rotation
* Ball B: 35 minutes / 5 rotations = 7 minutes/rotation
Next, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 7, which represents the time it takes for both balls to meet again at the starting point.
The LCM of 13 and 7 is 91.
Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 91 minutes, which is 1 hour and 31 minutes.
Action: Answer(""A"") 
","If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes. If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes, it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes.
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points. Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations. Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T. Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point. Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13. The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13. Hence
X = 7 (13) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes

Let x be the number of brown sharpeners. 
Then, the number of white sharpeners is 18 - x.
The total cost for brown sharpeners is x * (price of a brown sharpener).
The total cost for white sharpeners is (18 - x) * (price of a brown sharpener + 1).
The total cost is 100, so we have the equation: x * (price of a brown sharpener) + (18 - x) * (price of a brown sharpener + 1) = 100.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 18 * (price of a brown sharpener) + 18 - x = 100.
This equation has two variables, so we need another equation to solve for x.
We know that x must be a positive integer and less than 18.

We need to find the number of ways to choose 2 distinct letters out of 26, and then 2 digits out of 10. 
This involves combinations, not permutations, as the order of the letters and numbers doesn't matter.
Number of ways to choose 2 distinct letters = 26C2 = (26 * 25) / (2 * 1) = 325
Number of ways to choose 2 digits = 10C2 = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) = 45
Total number of distinct bike numbers = 325 * 45 = 14625

","Out of 26 alphabets two distinct letters can be chosen in 26P2 ways. Coming to the numbers part, there are 10 ways to choose the first digit and similarly, there are another 10 ways to choose the second digit. Hence, there are in total 10X10 = 100 ways.
Combined with letters there are 6P2 X 100 ways = 65000 ways to choose vehicle numbers.

Let's assume John starts with 100 ml of 50% strong milk tea.
*   **First replacement:** He replaces 15 ml of tea with milk. The amount of tea remaining is 85 ml * 50% = 42.5 ml. 
*   **Second replacement:** He replaces another 15 ml. The amount of tea remaining is now 70 ml * 50% = 35 ml.

This is closest to option E.
Action: Answer(""E"") 
","Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50% milk tea.
In step 1, 15% of the tea is replaced with milk. Thus, 85% of the original tea remains. Since this is done twice, we have a concentration of 50x0.85x0.85% (=36.125%) of tea solution.
Finally, 10% of this solution is replaced with milk again. So, the final concentration of tea is 36.125*0.9%
This equals 32.51% of tea solution.

C received 150,000 out of 375,000, which is 2/5 of the total profit.
This means C's investment was active for 2/5 of the year, which is 2/5 * 12 months = 4.8 months.

Let's denote the breadth as x. 
Then, the length would be 4x + 1.
The area is length × breadth, so x(4x + 1) = 150.
Solving this equation gives x = 6 (ignoring the negative solution as length cannot be negative).
Therefore, the length is 4*6 + 1 = 25m and breadth is 6m.
Perimeter is 2*(length + breadth) = 2*(25 + 6) = 62m.
Action: Answer(""C"") 
","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
