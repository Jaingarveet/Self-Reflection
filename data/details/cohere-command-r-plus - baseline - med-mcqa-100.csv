The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

The most common type of stomach cancer (malignancy) is adenocarcinoma, which accounts for about 90-95% of all cases.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Ans. A: Adenocarcinoma Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"". Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma). Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A,A,1,273,44,317,

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research.

Non small cell carcinomas Small cell carcinomas For non small cell carcinomas the primary modality depends on the extent of disease * Localized diseases: (Stage 1 & H) * * Small cell lung carcinomas behave as systemic disease. Most small cell carcinomas have already spread at the time of presentation beyond the bounds of surgery and they are managed primarily by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Primary modality of treatment is surgery -- pulmonary resection. * Advanced disease: Radiotherapy with curative intent is advocated (+- chemotherapy) * Metastatic disease (Stage IV) symptomatic/suppoive If we were to go by the information available in the question, The maximum tumor size (T) is = 5 cm ( 3), i.e. T2 There is no nodal involvement (No) There is no distal metastases (Mo) Thus it is T2 No Mo disease or stage I disease The treatment of choice for stage I disease is surgery i.e. Pulmonary resection The tumor in question has no nodal involvement and no metastases and hence is likely to be a non small cell carcinoma.

","Thought: 
Protein structure refers to the different levels of organization of a protein molecule.
Primary structure refers to the linear sequence of amino acids, which is determined by the nucleic acid sequence of the gene that codes for the protein.
Secondary structure refers to local spatial patterns in the polypeptide chain, including alpha helices and beta sheets.
Tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, including all the atoms in that chain.
Quaternary structure refers to the structure formed by multiple polypeptide chains, either from the same protein or from different proteins, that function as a multimer.

Denaturation refers to the process by which a protein loses its native tertiary or quaternary structure, typically due to exposure to extreme environmental conditions such as heat, acid, or chemical treatment. This process generally results in the loss of the protein's biological activity.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the primary structure of a protein is not lost during denaturation.

The condition described here is cystic fibrosis, which is caused by a mutation in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. This gene codes for a chloride channel.
The correct answer is C: Decreased glycosylated chloride channel.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases that affects white populations (1/2000). The primary abnormality in patients with cystic fibrosis involves the epithelial transpo of chloride. Normally, binding of a ligand to a membrane surface receptor activates adenyl cyclase, which leads to increased intracellular cAMP. This in turn activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), causing it to open and release chloride ions. Sodium ions and water then follow the chloride ions to maintain the normal viscosity of mucus. The most common abnormality in patients with CF involves decreased glycosylation of the CFTR, which then does not become incorporated into the cell membrane. A lack of chloride channels then causes decreased chloride, sodium, and water secretion, all of which together results in a very thick mucus (the other name of CF is mucoviscidosis). These thick mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, causing fibrosis and cystic dilation of the ducts (hence the name cystic fibrosis). Decreased excretion of pancreatic lipase leads to malabsorption of fat and steatorrhea, which may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins. Thick mucus may also cause intestinal obstruction in neonates, a condition called meconium ileus. Abnormal mucus in the pulmonary tree leads to atelectasis, fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent pulmonary infections, especially with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species. Obstruction of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles in males leads to sterility, while obstruction of the bile duct produces jaundice.

","Thought: 
Opisthotonus posture is caused by strychnine poisoning, which comes from the seeds of the Strychnous nux-vomica tree.
Action: Answer(""D"")","STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

","Thought: 
Spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward onto another.
Anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view X-rays are essential for diagnosis, providing information on vertebral alignment and any potential slip.
While CT and MRI scans can also be useful, they are not always necessary. In this case, a CT scan is the investigative option that is less commonly used and, therefore, not routinely considered ""useful"" as the other options.

An unstable lie in pregnancy refers to the position of the fetus, which can change frequently and is considered common in early pregnancy but rare in the third trimester. 

Oligohydramnios refers to a decrease in amniotic fluid, which can occur due to a variety of reasons but is not directly related to an unstable lie. 

Placenta praevia (placenta previa), however, is a condition where the placenta is located in the lowest part of the uterus, either covering the cervical os or close to it. This can cause vaginal bleeding and an unstable lie, especially in the third trimester, and is a serious complication requiring medical attention.
