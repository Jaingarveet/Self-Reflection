  C: $(0.8)(1.08) p$
  D: $\frac{p}{(0.8)(1.08)}$
","Solution:
Let the original price of the laptop be $x$.
The discount given is 20%, so the discounted price is $0.8x$.
The sales tax on the discounted price is 8%, so the total amount paid is $(1.08)(0.8x) = 0.864x$.
We know that the total amount paid is $p$, so we can set up the equation $0.864x = p$ and solve for $x$.
Dividing both sides by $0.864$, we get $x = \frac{p}{0.864}$.
Therefore, the original price of the computer in terms of $p$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{p}{0.88}}$.","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are retry. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$.

The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them.

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$.

Since the relationship between the merchandise weight $x$ and the shipping charge $f(x)$ is linear, a function in the form $f(x)=m x+b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, can be used. In this situation, the constant $m$ represents the additional shipping charge, in dollars, for each additional pound of merchandise shipped, and the constant $b$ represents a one-time charge, in dollars, for shipping any weight, in pounds, of merchandise. Using any two pairs of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$ and $(20,31.79)$, and dividing the difference in the charges by the difference in the weights gives the value of $m: m=\frac{31.79-21.89}{20-10}$, which simplifies to $\frac{9.9}{10}$, or 0.99. Substituting the value of $m$ and any pair of values from the table, such as $(10,21.89)$, for $x$ and $f(x)$, respectively, gives the value of $b: 21.89=0.99(10)+b$, or $b=11.99$.

","Thought:
The mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values. The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. 
The outlier measurement of 24 inches is much larger than the other values, so it will have a significant effect on the mean and range. The median is not affected by extreme values, so it will not change much.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is retry. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches. Choice $B$ is retry because the median length of the 21 fish represented in the table is 12 , and after the 24-inch measurement is removed, the median of the remaining 20 lengths is also 12.

The total number of students is 18 + 122 = 140.
Let's assume there are L left-handed female students, R right-handed female students, M left-handed male students, and N right-handed male students.
From the table, we know that L + R = 18 and M + N = 122.
Also, R = 5L and N = 9M.
Therefore, L + 5L = 6L and M + 9M = 10M.
So, the total number of female students is 6L and the total number of male students is 10M.
Thus, the probability that a right-handed student selected at random is female is (6L) / (R + N) = (6L) / (5L + 9M).
We need to find the value of (6L) / (5L + 9M) when L + R + M + N = 140 and L + 5L + M + 9M = 140.
Simplifying the second equation, we get 6L + 10M = 140, or 3L + 5M = 70.
We can substitute 5M = 70 - 3L into (6L) / (5L + 9M) to get (6L) / (5L + 9M) = (6L) / (5L + 9(70 - 3L)/5).
Simplifying this expression, we get (6L) / (5L + 126 - 27L/5) = (30L) / (99 - 2L).
We want to find the value of (6L) / (5L + 9M) when L + R + M + N = 140 and L + 5L + M + 9M = 140.
This is equivalent to finding the value of (30L) / (99 - 2L) when 6L + 10M = 140.
We can solve for M in terms of L from 6L + 10M = 140 to get M = (70 - 3L) / 5.
Substituting this into 3L + 5M = 70, we get 3L + 5(70 - 3L)/5 = 70, or L = 10.
Therefore, M = (70 - 3(10)) / 5 = 14.
Finally, we can substitute L = 10 and M = 14 into (30L) / (99 - 2L) to get (30(10)) / (99 - 2(10)) = 300 / 79.

n = 3x + 5 (since he has 5 milliliters left over when giving each student 3 milliliters)
n + 21 = 4x (since he needs an additional 21 milliliters when giving each student 4 milliliters)
We can solve for ""n"" in the first equation: n = 3x + 5

","Thought:
The formula is $H=1.88 L+32.01$.
The coefficient of $L$ is 1.88.
This means that for each one-inch increase in femur length, the height increases by approximately 1.88 inches.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is correct. It's given that $L$ is the femur length, in inches, and $H$ is the height, in inches, of an adult male. Because $L$ is multiplied by 1.88 in the equation, for every increase in $L$ by 1 , the value of $H$ increases by 1.88. Therefore, the meaning of 1.88 in this context is that a man's height increases by approximately 1.88 inches for each oneinch increase in his femur length.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{C}$ are retry and may result from misinterpreting the context and the values the variables are representing.",C,D,0,468,60,528,

","Thought:
We can solve the system of equations using substitution or elimination method.
Let's use the elimination method to solve the system of equations.
Multiplying the second equation by 3, we get $-3x+6y=-57$.
Adding this equation to the first equation, we get $10y=-80$.
Therefore, $y=-8$.
Substituting $y=-8$ in the second equation, we get $x=3(-8)+19=-17$.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Adding $x$ and 19 to both sides of $2 y-x=-19$ gives $x=2 y+19$. Then, substituting $2 y+19$ for $x$ in $3 x+4 y=-23$ gives $3(2 y+19)+4 y=-23$. This last equation is equivalent to $10 y+57=-23$. Solving $10 y+57=-23$ gives $y=-8$. Finally, substituting -8 for $y$ in $2 y-x=-19$ gives $2(-8)-x=-19$, or $x=3$. Therefore, the solution $(x, y)$ to the given system of equations is $(3,-8)$.Choices $A, C$, and $D$ are retry because when the given values of $x$ and $y$ are substituted in $2 y-x=-19$, the value of the left side of the equation does not equal -19 .",B,B,1,381,108,489,
