","Thought:
The rectangular solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15.
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
The diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250).
The diameter of the sphere is equal to the square root of 250 times 2, which is approximately 19.7889.
Rounding to the nearest ten-thousandth gives 19.7889 ≈ 19.7888.

If Amy uses a single letter to represent each type of book, she will need at least 10 letters.
If she uses a pair of two different letters, she will need to choose 2 letters out of 26 for the first letter, and 1 letter out of 25 for the second letter (since the order of letters in a pair does not matter). This gives us 26*25/2 = 325 possible pairs.
If she uses a pair of the same letters, she will need to choose 1 letter out of 26. This gives us 26 possible pairs.
Therefore, the total number of unique codes needed is 10 + 325 + 26 = 361.

Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.

Let's assume that Alex made x toys and Jacob made y toys.
We can form two equations based on the given information:
Equation 1: x + y = 35
Equation 2: x/7 + y/9 = [REDACTED]
We need to solve for y, which represents the number of toys made by Jacob.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs., and Jacob has worked for y hrs. So, number of toys prepared by Alex is x/7, and Jacob is y/9. Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35.
=> x/7 + y/9 = 35.
=> 9x + 7y = (35)(63)
=> 7y = (35)(63) - 9x
=> y = (5)(63) - (9/7)x
=> y = 315 - (9/7)x
=> x is to be a multiple of 7. Also, we need to minimize the difference between x & y. Here are some possible values,
x = 126, y = 315 - (9/7)126 = 153
x = 133, y = 315 - (9/7)133 = 144
x = 140, y = 315 - (9/7)140 = 135
x = 147, y = 315 - (9/7)147 = 126

The sum of the measures of minor arc AB, minor arc BC, and minor arc BD is equal to the circumference of the circle.

One of the numbers is 350.
Using the formula that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM, we can find the other number.
Let x be the other number.
11 * 7700 = 350 * x
x = (11 * 7700) / 350

Using the order of operations (PEMDAS), we should first perform the multiplication inside the brackets, then the addition and subtraction outside the brackets, and finally simplify the expression on the left-hand side.
[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7]/[13 × 13 - 156] = 6
[5 + ? × 19 - 22]/[169 - 156] = 6
[? × 19 - 17]/[13] = 6
? × 19 - 17 = 78
? × 19 = 95
? = 5
Action: Answer(""C"")","(? × 19 - 17)/(169 - 156) = 6
=> ? × 19 - 17 = 13 × 6 = 76
=> ? × 19 = 78 + 17 = 95
? = 95/19 = 5

John replaces 15% of 50% strong milk tea twice, which means he replaces 7.5% of tea with milk twice.
After the first replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 42.5%.
After the second replacement, the concentration of tea becomes 36.125%.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with milk.
Action: Answer(""E"")","Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50% milk tea.
In step 1, 15% of the tea is replaced with milk. Thus, 85% of the original tea remains. Since this is done twice, we have a concentration of 50x0.85x0.85% (=36.125%) of tea solution.
Finally, 10% of this solution is replaced with milk again. So, the final concentration of tea is 36.125*0.9%
This equals 32.51% of tea solution.

","Thought:
Using the formula from the reflection, we can solve for the unknown variable.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Assume that C was there in the business for x months
A:B:C = 40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*x
= 40*12 : 60*10 : 120x = 40 : 5*10 : 10x
=8 : 10 : 2x
= 4 : 5 : x
C's share = 375000*x/(9+x) = 150000
=> 375x/(9+x) = 150
=> 15x = 6(9+x)
=> 5x = 18 + 2x
=> 3x = 18
=> x = 18/3 = 6
It means C was there in the business for 6 months. Given that B joined the business
after 2 months. Hence C joined after 4 months after B joined

We can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle to solve this problem.
We need to find the length and breadth of the rectangular piece.
We can use the given information to form equations and solve them.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
