","Action: Answer(""A"")","The value of radiography as a diagnostic aid in orthodontics was proclaimed by W.A. Price in 1990, 5 years after the discovery of X-rays. 
The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. 
The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/ﬁlm/patient projection geometry. 
In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness.

It consists of five parameters: cervical dilation, cervical consistency (softness/firmness), cervical effacement (length), fetal station, and position of the cervix. Each parameter is assigned a score from 0 to 2 or 3, and the total score ranges from 0 to 13.

In this scenario, the patient's cervical dilation is 3 cm (score of 2), the cervix is slightly soft (score of 1), the cervical length is < 0.5 cm (score of 2), the fetal head station is -1 (score of 1), and the cervix is anterior (score of 1).
