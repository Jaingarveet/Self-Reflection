Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought: 
All the materials listed can be recycled, but not all can be reused many times. Steel cans, glass bottles, and plastic containers can be recycled and reused many times. Paper containers, on the other hand, can be recycled but not reused many times due to the degradation of the fibers each time they are recycled.

Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
Frost is formed when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas (water vapor) to a solid (ice) without becoming a liquid first. This process is known as deposition, which is a type of phase transition. However, deposition is not an option in the choices. The closest option to deposition is sublimation, but sublimation is the transition from solid to gas, not gas to solid. Therefore, the correct answer should be the process where gas turns into a solid or liquid, which is condensation.

After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Thought: 
The scientific method involves testing and retesting to ensure the validity of results. Independent verification is a crucial part of this process. Therefore, asking an independent lab to retest the antibiotic would strengthen the researchers' conclusions.

Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Thought: 
Inherited traits are those that are passed down from parents to their offspring through genes. Height, hair color, skin color, and intelligence are all traits that can be influenced by genetics. However, all of these traits can also be influenced by environmental factors. For example, a person's height can be influenced by their diet and nutrition during their growing years. Hair color can be changed artificially. Skin color can change based on sun exposure. Intelligence can be influenced by a person's environment and experiences. Therefore, all of these traits are both inherited and influenced by the environment.

Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
In the scientific method, if the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, the next step is typically to revise the hypothesis based on the new data and then repeat the investigation. Therefore, Michelle should change her hypothesis to match the results and then perform the investigation again.
