  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","You're right, let me carefully re-evaluate this question based on the passage and your guidance.
The third paragraph discusses critics of the second version of multicultural education. These critics argue that:
1) The methods used in the second version, while claiming to be neutral, are still based on Western scientific values like objectivity, logic, and empirical verification. 
2) Insisting on using these Western scientific methods to understand non-scientific cultures is distorting and an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
3) Real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting that culture's own, often non-scientific, perspectives and methods.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) Comparing moral codes wouldn't necessarily be objectionable, as it doesn't specify a scientific method.
B) Studying a culture's literature to understand its values aligns with the critics' view of using the culture's own perspectives. 
C) Using Western scientific methods to study a non-scientific culture is exactly what the critics in the third paragraph object to as distorting and chauvinistic.
D) Applying one culture's theories to another's literature could be seen as not understanding each on its own terms.
E) Using scientific methods to criticize Western culture doesn't address the critics' concern about imposing those methods on other cultures.
Therefore, the answer that would most likely be considered objectionable by the critics discussed in the third paragraph is C.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The passage presents three main positions on the role of literature:
   - Art should stand above everyday reality 
   - Art should expose injustice and contribute to creating a new society
   - Dostoyevsky's view that reality shaped by the person experiencing it is literature's crucial source
2. The first two positions are mentioned briefly without much elaboration. Most of the passage focuses on explaining Dostoyevsky's third position in detail.
3. Dostoyevsky's view is elaborated on at length, explaining his perspective on the relationship between reality and fantasy, his critique of the radical critics' views, his definition of what makes a work ""artistic"", and his thoughts on art's usefulness.
4. Dostoyevsky's position is directly contrasted with the radical critics' views. The passage explains how Dostoyevsky saw their demands that literature depict reality ""as it is"" as meaningless and their emphasis on art's usefulness as unsatisfactory.
5. Dostoyevsky's third position is clearly given the most detailed treatment in the passage. His view is explained in depth and differentiated from the other two positions, especially the radical critics' perspective.

  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
","Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. The key assertion being tested is in lines 11-16: ""But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz""
2. Looking at each answer choice:
A) This choice supports the assertion rather than calling it into question. It suggests Morrison did intentionally structure Jazz based on a musical style.
B) This choice directly contradicts the assertion that no African American author before Morrison used a musical genre to structure a novel. It suggests some earlier novelists used blues music structure.
C) This is an overly broad statement about all novels dealing with arts. It doesn't specifically address African American authors or the assertion about Jazz being the first.
D) This is also too broad, suggesting any novel can be considered musical. It doesn't relate to the specific assertion about deliberately structuring a novel on a musical genre.
E) The relative number of African American authors writing about music compared to non-African American authors is not directly relevant to the assertion about Jazz being the first novel structured on a musical genre.
3. The best answer is (B). If some African American novelists had previously structured novels based on blues music, that would call into question the claim that Morrison was the first to do this with jazz in her novel Jazz.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Passage A argues that while further testing and standards for fingerprint identification may be desirable, the long history of its use in criminal trials and expert consensus on its reliability mean it should not be rejected outright. It contends fingerprint examiners do follow a consistent approach and have low error rates.
2. Passage B argues there are no objective standards for declaring fingerprint matches, and examiners cannot quantify the likelihood of partial prints from different people matching. It states the error rate in practice is not well studied, and a rigorous test showed a high error rate. 
3. While the passages reach different conclusions on fingerprint evidence reliability, they both focus heavily on the question of error rates - how often examiners make false matches. Passage A says the error rate is ""exceedingly low"" while Passage B says it is not well studied and may be high.
4. The likelihood of partial prints from different people matching seems to be the key underlying issue motivating both passages' arguments about reliability and admissibility of fingerprint evidence. Passage A implies this probability is very low, enabling low error rates. Passage B argues this probability is unknown and critical to evaluating fingerprint evidence.
5. Answer choice C best captures this common premise - both passages suggest that to properly assess the reliability and value of fingerprint evidence, one must know the probability of partial prints from different individuals matching.

  D: pleased that it does not interfere with common defense strategies used by defense lawyers
  E: convinced that it does not represent a conflict of interest for defense lawyers
","You're right, let me take a closer look at this question and passage again.
The key part of the passage is where the author states:
""For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.""
This indicates the author believes the twofold obligation requires lawyers to balance their duty to defendants with their duty to the court and society. Lawyers should not make false assertions or try to prove a client's innocence if they know the client is guilty.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This aligns with the author's view that the twofold obligation enables lawyers to balance their responsibilities. The author seems confident this is the right approach.
B, C, D, E: These choices are not strongly supported by the passage. The author does not express certainty the twofold obligation prevents representing guilty clients, helps uncover facts, avoids interfering with defense strategies, or eliminates conflicts of interest.
Upon reflection, choice A most accurately captures the author's attitude that the twofold obligation allows lawyers to properly balance their competing duties as described in the passage.

  D: It showed that uraniwn atoms were the easiest to split.
  E: It recogoized the daogers of working with radioactive substances.
","Okay, let's carefully analyze the passage and question to determine the correct answer:
The key points in the passage relevant to the question are:
1) Before neutron/proton composition of nuclei was experimentally shown, some theoretical physicists calculated it should be possible in principle to break atoms apart. 
2) However, the neutron-bombardment experiments in the 1930s were not aimed at splitting atoms, and researchers were not receptive to that possibility in that context.
3) The puzzling radioactive substances produced by the experiments remained unidentified, partly because precise chemical analysis was difficult, but more significantly because researchers expected the products to have nuclear composition close to uranium.
4) When barium was conclusively identified as a product, this went against all previous nuclear physics experience, but the proton/neutron numbers of barium and technetium added up to that of uranium.
5) Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to theory - the atoms were actually being split. This linked the evidence that had been present for some time.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: The passage does not say the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments about splitting atoms, just that the experiments were not aimed at that and researchers were not receptive to it happening in that context. 
B: The passage does not mention the physics community reevaluating calculations about splitting atoms.
C: The passage states the products of neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified for some time, but not that they were never identified. Barium was eventually conclusively identified.
D: The passage does not compare the ease of splitting uranium atoms to other atoms.
E: The passage does mention dangers of working with highly radioactive materials hampering chemical analysis, supporting this choice.

  D: The development of innovative marketing strategies will ensure acceptance of the new digital model.
  E: Widespread familiarily with new ways of storing information will be the primary reason for the acceptance of the new digital model.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The main argument of the passage is that a new digital publishing model is likely to eventually supplant or rival traditional publishing. This is due to the economic efficiency and convenience of printing books on demand from a vast digital catalog.
2. The author states his belief directly: ""it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be printed and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies...""
3. The argument flows from the enabling technology (instantaneous digital transmission) to the implications (lower costs, higher royalties demanded, pressure on traditional publishers to adapt).
4. The key drivers of change emphasized are: 
- Lower costs by eliminating physical inventory, warehousing, shipping, retail display
- Vast ""in print"" catalog enabled by digital files
- Higher author royalties demanded due to their larger share of value
- Competitive pressure from upstart digital firms forcing traditional publishers to adapt
5. Evaluating the choices:
A) Changing consumer tastes are not mentioned as a major factor.
B) Keeping books ""in print"" is highlighted as a key benefit of the digital model.
C) Agents' demands are a result of the model, not the main impetus for transition.
D) Marketing strategies are not discussed.

2. Passage A is focused on a specific criminal case and appeal. Passage B does not mention any specific case and instead discusses the field of fingerprint analysis in general.
3. The implications in Passage A are narrower, relating to the court's decision in this particular case to accept fingerprint evidence. Passage B has broader implications, calling into question the reliability of fingerprint evidence in general due to lack of standards and error rate data.
4. Comparing the two, Passage A is more narrowly focused on a single case, while Passage B takes a broader look at issues across the entire field of fingerprint analysis.

1. The key sentences are:
- Lines 28-31: ""When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.""
- Lines 7-11: ""They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court.""
2. Viewpoints expressed:
- Lines 28-31 express the author's opinion that lawyers who know their client is guilty should not try to prove innocence, but argue for leniency in sentencing. 
- Lines 7-11 report the view of some legal scholars that lawyers should not judge guilt and should focus solely on representing the defendant.
3. The viewpoints disagree. The author is arguing against the view reported in lines 7-11.

  E: present an example of the high levels of competition achieved in transportation industries
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The main concepts in the passage are the ""Pin Factory"" (representing increasing returns to scale and tendency toward monopoly) and the ""Invisible Hand"" (representing the idea that many competitors are needed for free markets to work properly). The passage discusses the contradiction between these two concepts.
2. The key concept in the question is the purpose of mentioning railroads as an example. 
3. Railroads are mentioned in this part of the passage: ""Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads.""
4. In this context, railroads are used as an example of an industry that has increasing returns to scale, which is a characteristic of the ""Pin Factory"" concept. The passage says this was ""obviously"" the case for railroads and other enterprises. 
5. The example is not used to resolve an ambiguity in the Invisible Hand metaphor (A), illustrate shortcomings of emphasis on the Invisible Hand (D), or present an example of high competition (E). While it relates to the difficulty of representing the Pin Factory idea mathematically (B), that is not the main purpose of the example.
6. The best answer is (C). The railroad example is used to call attention to the fact that many real-world industries have increasing returns, which is a key characteristic of the Pin Factory concept.

This directly challenges the idea that studying other cultures through one's own methods and values is uniquely Eurocentric or chauvinistic. If non-Western cultures do the same, the criticism loses force.
D) The criticism is not about Western students understanding their own culture's achievements. This is off-topic.
E) The necessity of genuine cultural understanding is not in dispute. This choice doesn't counter the criticism about how that understanding is achieved.
3. A, B, D and E can be eliminated as they don't squarely address the key points of the criticism.
