1. The given information states that in most parts of the country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees. 
2. Growing cacti is difficult in a humid climate, while raising orange trees is difficult in a cold climate.
3. Therefore, for it to be easy to grow either cacti or orange trees in most of the country, most of the country must be either not humid (allowing cacti) or not cold (allowing orange trees).
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A. If half the country was both humid and cold, it would be difficult to grow either cacti or orange trees in that half. This contradicts the given information, so this could be false.
B. The information doesn't specify anything about hot climates, so we can't determine if this is true or false. 
C. This must be true. If most of the country allows either cacti or orange trees, then there must be some parts that are neither cold nor humid.
D. The information states it's easy to grow cacti in most of the country. So this statement must be false.
E. If most of the country was humid, it would be difficult to grow cacti in most of the country. This contradicts the given information, so this could be false.

C: This must be true. If most Lac Nichoutec prize winners also won international prizes, then at least some of the international prize winners must have been Canadian, since Lac Nichoutec only shows Canadian films.
D: This is possible but not certain. Perhaps every Lac Nichoutec winner also won an international prize, or perhaps some didn't. We can't say for sure.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The radio producer's argument has the following structure:
1. We have two options: A (devote airtime to other genres) or B (stick with classical music only)
2. If we do B, a negative consequence will result (the station may go out of business) 
3. We should not risk that negative consequence
4. Therefore, we should do A
Now let's examine each answer choice to see which one most closely follows this pattern of reasoning:
A: Two options (buy blinds or make curtains). If blinds, a negative consequence (expensive). Avoid that consequence, so do curtains. 
This matches the original argument structure closely.
B: Two options (make curtains or buy blinds). A conditional about blinds (if buy blinds, then special order needed). A reason to avoid blinds (no time for special orders). Conclusion to make curtains.
While similar, this doesn't match the key ""if B then negative consequence, avoid consequence by doing A"" structure.
C: Three options given (curtains, valances, or both). A goal stated (privacy). Only curtains meet the goal. Conclusion to do curtains not valances. 
This is more about meeting a goal than avoiding a negative consequence by choosing the other option.
D: Two options (buy fabric or make valances). If make valances, then must buy blinds. Hard to match fabric, so buy blinds.
Doesn't match the original structure - the ""if B then negative consequence"" and ""avoid consequence by doing A"" elements are missing.
E: Two options (buy blinds or make curtains). If buy blinds and don't make valances, negative consequence (bare windows). Avoid bare windows. So if no curtains, then valances.
Close, but not quite the same structure. The conclusion is a conditional rather than simply ""do A"".
After analyzing each choice, A is the best match for the original argument's reasoning pattern.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The economics professor's conclusion is that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza. 
2. The premises supporting this conclusion are:
   - Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense.
   - Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. 
   - Accepting the coupons would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books.
3. There is a gap between the premises and the conclusion. The premises state Checkers's actions and the consequences of those actions, but they do not directly prove Checkers's motive. We need to find an assumption that bridges this gap.
4. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) This is too broad. It assumes any refusal to accept a competitor's coupons is solely motivated by a desire to hurt the competitor, which is not necessarily true.
   B) This looks promising. If we assume this statement is true, then Checkers's refusal to accept the coupons, even when it would cost nothing and satisfy potential customers, would imply that Checkers's motive was to hurt Marty's.
   C) This is too specific. It talks about a particular case, but we need a general principle that applies to the argument.
   D) This is irrelevant. The argument is not about whether accepting coupons helps a competitor, but about the motive for refusing to accept them.
   E) This is the opposite of what we need. The argument is about a case where accepting coupons would satisfy customers.

  E: A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points in the judge's reasoning are:
1) The defendant was charged with noncompliance with national codes, not local codes. 
2) The defendant's excuse of confusion between national and local codes might be acceptable for noncompliance with local codes.
3) But that excuse is unacceptable for the charge of noncompliance with national codes.
The judge is essentially saying that ignorance or confusion about the difference between two sets of codes (national vs local) is not an excuse for violating one of those codes (the national code).
Looking at the answer choices:
A is not relevant. The judge doesn't say anything about overlap between local and national codes.
B and C are about the relative strictness of local vs national codes, which is not the focus of the judge's reasoning. 
D directly captures the key principle the judge is relying on - that ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an excuse for noncompliance with one of them. This supports the judge's rejection of the defendant's excuse.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The teacher's main conclusion is that funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated. 
The teacher offers two main points in support of this conclusion:
1) Participating in competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination.
2) Research shows that adults with feelings of inferiority (which critics argue athletics instills in some children) become more successful than those without such anxieties.
The question is asking specifically about the role of the first point - that athletics may increase strength and coordination.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This fits. The teacher is suggesting that athletics should be funded for the additional reason that it may lead to more successful adults, beyond just increasing strength and coordination.
B) The teacher is not attempting to refute the claim that athletics increases strength and coordination. In fact, the teacher seems to accept this claim.
C) The teacher is not offering this as a hypothesis or providing additional evidence for it. It's stated as an accepted premise.
D) While the teacher is arguing against eliminating athletic funding, they are not citing the strength and coordination benefits as an insufficient reason. Rather, they are providing it as one positive reason in favor of their conclusion.
E) The strength and coordination benefits are not presented as an objection to the teacher's argument, but rather as a point in support of it.
Therefore, the best answer is A - the potential for athletics to increase strength and coordination is mentioned as one possible reason to maintain athletic funding, and the teacher suggests the potential for greater adult success as an additional reason.

  E: Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue.

The editorial's argument is:
1) The party has expressed that increasing education spending is a worthy goal. 
2) The same party has also claimed the government should not increase education spending.
3) Therefore, the party's policy is inconsistent.
The key is that the editorial concludes the policy is inconsistent based on the two stated positions. It assumes those two positions are contradictory.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This matches the editorial's reasoning, but is stated about an individual legislator rather than the party. Still, it captures the same assumed contradiction.
B) The editorial's argument does not depend on any assumptions about what reduces long-term education spending. Incorrect.
C) The editorial assumes the opposite - that if something is a worthy goal, you should try to achieve it. Incorrect. 
D) This directly states the assumption the editorial makes - it's inconsistent to hold a goal is worthy but should not be pursued. Correct.
E) The editorial only discusses inconsistency within one party. It doesn't assume anything about members of a party always being consistent with each other. Incorrect.

  E: Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense.
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The ethicist's argument can be summarized as:
1. Marital vows often promise to love ""until death do us part"" 
2. If ""love"" refers to a feeling, this promise makes no sense, because feelings are not within one's control
3. A promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense
Therefore,
4. No one should take ""love"" in marital vows to be referring to feelings
The question is asking what unstated assumption is necessary for the conclusion (4) to follow logically from the premises.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is too broad. The argument only requires that the feeling of love is outside our control, not all feelings.
B) This is promising, as it directly supports the idea that promising to love (if love is a feeling) makes no sense. But it's not the only assumption needed.
C) This looks correct. If ""love"" can refer to something controllable (like a commitment or action), then the ethicist's conclusion wouldn't necessarily follow. So the ethicist must be assuming ""love"" can only refer to the uncontrollable feeling for their argument to work.
D) This is also assumed, but even if we accept it, the conclusion could still be false if ""love"" can refer to something other than feelings. So C is a more essential assumption.
E) This is similar to B and D. It supports the argument but is not sufficient on its own to make the conclusion follow.
Therefore, C is the most essential unstated assumption. The ethicist's conclusion only follows if we assume ""love"" cannot refer to anything except uncontrollable feelings.

The key finding is that blood nicotine levels are the same for smokers regardless of whether they smoke low or high nicotine cigarettes. We need to find the choice that best explains this.
A: This suggests there's an upper limit on daily nicotine absorption. But it doesn't explain why low and high nicotine cigarette smokers end up with the same levels.
B: If low-nicotine cigarette smokers smoke more cigarettes per day, this could result in them getting the same total nicotine as high-nicotine cigarette smokers by the end of the day. This helps explain the finding.
C: This choice just says most nicotine gets absorbed even in small quantities. But it doesn't explain the equal daily blood levels for low vs high nicotine cigarettes. 
D: The tar levels in the cigarettes seem irrelevant to explaining the nicotine level finding.
E: The decrease of blood nicotine after stopping smoking is not directly relevant to explaining the main finding about low vs high nicotine cigarettes.

  E: Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The original argument's structure is:
- If X (the party's economic theories were sound) and Y (the party succeeded in implementing its program) had happened, then Z (inflation would have lessened considerably) would have occurred
- But Z did not occur (inflation actually increased)
- Therefore, X was not true (the party's economic theories were far off the mark)
Now let's examine each answer choice:
A: If X (people invaded) or Y (dramatic climate change), then Z (changes in architecture). Z did not occur, therefore X and Y did not occur. 
This matches the original argument structure.
B: If X (opposition party wins and keeps promise to cut wages), then Y (workers will strike). Y will not occur, therefore X will not fully occur (party won't keep promise).
This does not match the original structure.
C: If X (company sold subsidiaries) and Y (used cash to buy patent), then Z (stock price doubles). Z did not occur, therefore either X or Y or both did not occur.
This partially matches but concludes either X or Y or both did not happen, while the original concludes definitively X did not happen.
D: If X (rebels won battle) and Y (rebel leaders freed), then Z (residents show support). Z occurred, therefore X and Y occurred.
This inverts the structure, concluding X and Y happened because Z happened.
E: If X (new equipment worth investment), then Y (accuracy of forecasts rises) and Z (ratings rise). Z did not occur, therefore X did not occur.
This matches the original argument structure.
The answer choice with reasoning that most closely resembles the original argument is E. It follows the same logical structure:
If X, then Y and Z. Z did not occur, therefore X did not occur.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument's reasoning is:
1) Human tears contain stress hormones
2) Crying sheds tears 
3) Therefore, crying removes stress hormones from the body
4) Therefore, crying must reduce emotional stress
The argument assumes that because tears contain stress hormones, shedding tears is what reduces stress. But it fails to consider that the stress reduction could be due to something else about the act of crying besides the shedding of tears.
Looking at the answer choices:
A: This correctly identifies the flaw. The argument overlooks that crying may reduce stress for reasons other than shedding tears.
B: The argument doesn't confuse a necessary and sufficient condition. It's not claiming tears are sufficient for stress reduction, only that they lead to it.
C: The argument isn't concerned with stress also causing crying. This doesn't undermine the reasoning.
D: The argument doesn't discuss multiple factors. It only focuses on one proposed cause.
E: This matches the flaw in the argument. It assumes that because tears contain stress hormones, the shedding of tears must be the cause of stress reduction. But it doesn't adequately justify this causal link.
Both A and E identify the key flaw, but E most directly matches the argument's reasoning. The argument takes for granted that the presence of stress hormones in tears means shedding tears causes stress reduction.

  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.
","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step based on the given information:
Facts:
1. The museum displays only 20th century works.
2. The displayed works are either on loan from private collectors or part of the museum's permanent collection. 
3. Prints of all works in the permanent collection are sold in the museum store.
4. The store also sells prints of some works not in the permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks.
Now let's consider each answer choice:
A: This can't be concluded, as the store sells prints of some works (like Nighthawks) that may not be on display.
B: This must be true. The museum only displays 20th century works, and the store only sells prints of displayed works or other 20th century works like Nighthawks. 
C: This can't be concluded. The store sells prints of all permanent collection works, but not necessarily all works on loan.
D: This can't be concluded. Nighthawks is a 20th century work, but we don't know if it's currently on loan to the museum.
E: This can't be concluded. Just because a print is sold doesn't mean the original isn't also displayed.

  D: Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes.
  E: Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument's conclusion is that once Acme moves, most employees will have a commute over 30 minutes. 
The premises supporting this are:
1) Most employees can't afford housing within a 30-minute commute of the new location.
2) Acme is moving from Milltown to Ocean View.
A is not assumed by the argument. The current commute times in Milltown are not discussed.
B is not assumed. The chairperson's financial reasons for the move are not relevant to the conclusion about commute times.
C is not assumed. The argument does not make any claims about employee opinions on the move.
D seems necessary for the argument to work. If most employees already had 30+ minute commutes, then the conclusion wouldn't represent a change from the current situation. So the argument requires assuming commutes are currently under 30 minutes for most employees.
E is tempting but not necessarily assumed. Even with a big raise, housing near Ocean View could still be unaffordable. The argument only requires that housing ends up unaffordable, not that salaries remain the same.
Therefore, D is the best answer. The argument relies on assuming that currently, most employees have under 30 minute commutes, in order to conclude the move will cause most to have 30+ minute commutes.

  D: The fighting prowess of ninjas was exaggerated to mythic proportions in the years following the Tokngawa period.
  E: There were very few ninjas at any time other than during the Tokugawa period.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The main point of contention is whether most Japanese feared ninjas during the Tokugawa period. 
Patricia's claim: There was little ninja activity and most Japanese did not fear ninjas at that time.
Tamara's objection: Many wealthy Japanese had squeaky floors installed to detect ninjas, implying ninjas were feared.
To counter Tamara's objection, Patricia needs to show that the wealthy Japanese with squeaky floors are not representative of ""most Japanese"". 
Looking at the answer choices:
A) Poor Japanese also having squeaky floors supports Tamara's point that fear of ninjas was widespread. It doesn't help Patricia's argument.
B) Ninjas being able to silently walk on squeaky floors negates the purpose of the floors, but doesn't address whether most Japanese feared ninjas or not. 
C) If the wealthy were a small portion of the population, then their fear of ninjas as evidenced by the squeaky floors doesn't necessarily mean most Japanese shared that fear. This helps support Patricia's point.
D) Ninjas' fighting prowess being mythologized later doesn't tell us whether people feared them during the Tokugawa period itself.
E) The prevalence of ninjas at other times is not directly relevant to the level of fear during the Tokugawa period specifically.
Therefore, C is the strongest counter Patricia can make. It suggests the wealthy with their squeaky floors were an unrepresentative minority, consistent with Patricia's claim that most Japanese did not fear ninjas at the time.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key facts from the passage are:
1) Cat allergies are caused by certain proteins in cats' skin secretions and saliva
2) The specific proteins people are allergic to varies from person to person

4) There are no cats that can't cause allergies at all
5) But a specific cat may cause allergies in some people and not others
Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is not supported. The passage indicates allergies depend on proteins, not cat breeds.
B) This is strongly supported. Since people are allergic to different proteins, no single cat will have all the proteins to trigger allergies in everyone.
C) The passage doesn't discuss variation in proteins between cats, only between allergy sufferers. Not enough info to support this.
D) The passage doesn't compare intensity of reactions, only whether a reaction occurs at all. Not supported.

","Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
The original argument has the following structure:
1. Most A have property X
2. Most things with property X also have property Y 
3. Therefore, most A have property Y
This is flawed because it assumes the majority overlap between A and X also overlaps with the majority of X that has Y. But those could be different subsets.
Looking at the answer choices:
A) Increased traffic leads to increased gas prices. Increased gas prices lead to more complaints. Concludes increased traffic causes more complaints.
This is the same flawed structure: Traffic → Gas prices → Complaints
B) Most common birds are migratory. Most migratory birds leave by November. Concludes few birds remain in winter. 
This is valid reasoning, not the same flaw. It's not assuming overlap between majorities.
C) Not surprising most speeding tickets go to sports car drivers, since people who don't want to drive fast don't buy sports cars.
This doesn't match the flawed structure. It's just noting an unsurprising correlation.
D) Most nature photographers find portraits boring. Most portrait photographers enjoy photographing dignitaries. Concludes nature photographers find dignitary portraits especially boring.
This matches the flawed structure: Nature photogs → Portrait boring → Dignitary portraits boring
E) Most snow-removal companies do summer lawn-care. Most summer lawn-care companies hire extra summer workers. Concludes most snow-removal companies hire extra in summer.
Also valid reasoning, directly connecting the majorities without an unfounded assumption.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument's main points are:
1) Technological innovation rarely benefits society as a whole. 
2) This is because those responsible for technological advances are almost always motivated by personal gain rather than societal benefit.
3) They strive to develop commercially viable technology.
The argument assumes that commercially viable technology cannot benefit society as a whole. In other words, it takes for granted that technology beneficial to society cannot be commercially successful.
However, this is a flawed assumption. Many technologies that have greatly benefited society (e.g. vaccines, renewable energy, the internet) have also been commercially successful. Commercial viability and societal benefit are not mutually exclusive.
The argument fails to consider that technologies developed for personal/commercial gain can still end up having positive impacts on society, even if that wasn't the primary motivation. The creators' intentions and the ultimate societal outcomes can diverge.
Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it ""takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable.""
