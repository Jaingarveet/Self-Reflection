The key points from the given context are:
1. To start a successful company, you need to be great in at least one area
2. This could be having the best product, being the fastest, having the lowest cost, or providing the highest value
Now let's evaluate each answer choice:
A: This captures the main idea - to compete, a company needs to excel in at least one key area. This looks promising.
B: While similar to A, this choice is a bit too strong. The passage doesn't say a company will definitely lose if it's not the best, just that it needs an edge to compete. 
C: The passage doesn't guarantee huge profits, just the ability to gain a foothold in the market. This goes beyond what's stated.
D: This is essentially restating choice A in a negative way. It's accurate, but A is a bit more direct and concise.
Between A and D, A more clearly summarizes the main point without unnecessary negatives.
Therefore, the best answer is A - excelling in at least one key area allows a company to gain a foothold and compete in the market.

1. The first premise states that the microorganism usually breeds above freezing temperatures.
2. The second premise states that it is currently winter and the lake water has frozen. This means the water temperature is at or below freezing.
3. The conclusion states that if the microorganism is indeed present in the lake, it will not reproduce now, given the current freezing conditions.
4. The argument structure is:
   Premise 1: The microorganism breeds above freezing 
   Premise 2: The lake is currently frozen (at or below freezing)
   Conclusion: If the microorganism is present, it will not reproduce now
5. The conclusion follows logically from the premises. If the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
6. However, the conclusion includes the conditional ""if the microorganism is present"". This leaves open the possibility that the microorganism may not actually be present in the lake.
7. So while the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, it is not an absolute statement. It depends on the presence of the microorganism, which is uncertain.

The key points from the economist's suggestion are:
1) Transferring polluting industries from developed to developing countries benefits developed countries by improving their natural environment.
2) Developing countries are compensated for the environmental pollution by increased employment and taxes.
3) As a result, both sides benefit, increasing total global welfare.
Now let's examine each answer choice:
A) The economist does not make any comparison about the importance of the natural environment between developed and developing countries. This is not a stated hypothesis.
B) While this may be true, it is not a hypothesis of the economist's argument. The existence of polluting industries in both developed and developing countries is not directly relevant.
C) The economist does not compare the degree of environmental pollution between developed and developing countries. This is not a hypothesis of the argument.
D) The economist suggests that polluting industries can generate employment and tax revenue in developing countries, compensating for the environmental damage. This implies that polluting industries may be more profitable or beneficial overall in developing countries compared to developed countries. This aligns with the economist's hypothesis.

2. Xiao Wang counters by saying that normally people don't observe comets far from the sun at all. The flickering light was only discovered this time through continuous and careful tracking.
3. Xiao Wang is not saying Xiao Chen's concepts are ambiguous (A), or that the argument lacks persuasion (B) or is self-contradictory (C). 
4. Rather, Xiao Wang provides an alternative explanation for why the flickers haven't been seen before - because distant comets aren't normally observed carefully. This fits with choice (D) - disagreeing with the conclusion and providing an alternative explanation.

3. Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height. Since one man is not tall, they must both be either tall or not tall.

5. From 3 and 4, we can conclude Liu Dawei is also not tall.
6. The prince Li Na has in mind is tall, handsome and a doctor. Wu Gang is the only one who could fit this description. Wang Wei is ruled out because he's not handsome (only 1 man is handsome). Li Qiang and Liu Dawei are ruled out because they are not tall and not doctors.

1. The two given statements are:
   - ""Money is like dung"" 
   - ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars""
2. If we assume both statements are true, then by substitution we can conclude ""Friends are like dung"". However, this conclusion is absurd and not true.
3. So logically, at least one of the two original statements must be false. If both were true, the absurd conclusion would follow.
4. The question asks what can be logically derived from the fact that ""friends are like dung"" is not true. 
5. Looking at the answer choices:
   A) We can't definitively say the first statement is false. It could be true while the second is false.

1. We know that either E or F will participate, but not both. Let's consider each case:
Case 1: E participates
- If E participates, then F does not. 
- Since F is not participating, M cannot participate either (based on the last condition).
- One of J or K must participate. If J participates, then G must also participate. 
- So in this case, the team could be E, G, J, and one other player (H or K).
Case 2: F participates 
- If F participates, then E does not.
- Since F is participating, M can now participate as well.
- One of J or K must participate. If J participates, then G must also participate.
- So in this case, the team could be F, M, one of J or K, and possibly G (if J is chosen).
2. The question asks which two players will make the four-person team the only choice. Looking at the two cases:
- In Case 1, there are still multiple possibilities for the fourth player (H or K). So E's participation doesn't limit it to one unique team.
- However, in Case 2, if we choose J as the ""one of J or K"", then G must also participate. This would make the team F, M, J, G - a unique choice.
Therefore, the two players that will make the four-person team the only choice are G and J.

The question is asking which choice, if true, would not allow the stated opinion to be questioned. In other words, which choice is consistent with the idea that sand and dust storms are natural disasters caused by climate and are inevitable.
Choice A suggests that grassland degradation has occurred over time in Inner Mongolia. This allows questioning the opinion, as it points to factors other than just climate.
Choice B compares the degraded grasslands in Inner Mongolia to healthier grasslands in Mongolia. This also allows questioning the opinion by suggesting factors other than climate are at play, since the grasslands differ despite being in the same general region.
Choice C notes that grass height is maintained in an uninhabited border area. This again allows questioning the opinion, as it indicates human factors play a role - where humans are absent, the grasslands are healthier.
Choice D directly states that human factors like overgrazing are the main cause of increased dust storms. This is the only choice that, if true, supports the stated opinion rather than allowing it to be questioned. Overgrazing could exacerbate the effects of natural drought.

3. Choice B says ""If you want, then give it to others."" This is consistent with the Golden Rule. If there is a way you want to be treated, it's good to treat others that way.
4. Choice C says ""Don't treat others unless you want to."" This also follows the Golden Rule in a backwards way. It's saying only treat others in ways you'd want to be treated.
5. Choice D says ""Whatever is applied to people should be what they want."" This generalizes Confucius's statement to say we should only do to people what they want. But his actual statement was about what you want for yourself, not what others want.

A: If the violent/pornographic content in Inferno is more moderate than other similar magazines, that doesn't provide an alternative explanation for advertisers leaving. It might even suggest they should stay.
B: Low credibility of magazines with violent/pornographic content could be another reason advertisers left, besides ethics. This weakens the argument.
C: If the leaving advertisers mainly promoted household goods, this could suggest they left because Inferno's new content didn't fit their target audience, not just for ethical reasons. This also weakens the argument.
D: Much higher advertising costs after the name change provides a clear economic reason for advertisers to leave, weakening the claim they left for ethical reasons.

B) The relative numbers of seals and crocodiles doesn't really impact whether seals caused the crocodile decline. This doesn't weaken the argument much.
C) If crocodiles were already declining before seals increased, this suggests the seal increase didn't initiate the decline. However, the seals could still be contributing to it. This only slightly weakens the argument.
D) If crocodiles and seals compete for the same food source (capelin), then an increase in seals could lead to less food for crocodiles, causing their numbers to drop. This actually strengthens the seal-crocodile connection rather than weakening it.
Therefore, A seems to weaken the argument the most by providing an alternative explanation (pollution) for the crocodile decline that is unrelated to seals.

  A: If Green Island cannot achieve its goal of increasing productivity by 20%, it will go bankrupt.
  B: In the next two years, if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it will not go bankrupt.
  C: If the market does not change, Green Island does not need to increase productivity to prevent bankruptcy.
  D: In the next two years, Green Island may increase productivity by 10%, but it is impossible to achieve the goal of increasing by 20%.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Green Island needs to increase productivity by 10% over the next two years to avoid bankruptcy. 
2. If Green Island can increase productivity by 10%, it can actually achieve a 20% productivity increase.
3. Looking at the answer choices:
A) This is not necessarily true. If Green Island increases productivity by 10-19%, it will avoid bankruptcy even though it didn't hit the 20% goal.
B) This is true. If productivity increases by 20%, that exceeds the 10% requirement to avoid bankruptcy.
C) This is true. The need to increase productivity is due to recent market changes. If the market hadn't changed, the productivity increase wouldn't be necessary.
D) This contradicts the given information. We're told that if 10% is achievable, then 20% is also achievable. So 20% is not impossible if 10% can be done.
Between B and C, B directly addresses what will happen if the 20% goal is met, while C introduces the tangential idea of markets not changing. 
Therefore, B is the best answer, as it most directly relates to the key facts in the question.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The argument concludes that hundreds of people lived in Aptripa Cave based on archaeological findings of tools, pottery, obsidian, silver and copper utensils in the cave dating back to the Neolithic Age.
To refute this argument, we need to find a statement that, if true, would undermine the conclusion that people lived in the cave.
A: The cave inspiring descriptions of hell in Greek mythology doesn't refute people living there in the Neolithic Age. 
B: If the cave was actually an ancient cemetery and funeral venue rather than a dwelling, that would refute the claim that hundreds of people lived there. The tools and utensils found could have been burial goods rather than signs of habitation.
C: Whether or not earlier prehistoric villages have been found in Europe is not directly relevant to refuting the claim about this specific cave.
D: The entrance collapsing 5000 years ago doesn't refute Neolithic Age habitation, since the Neolithic Age was much earlier, ending over 4000 BC.
Therefore, B is the best choice to refute the argument. If the cave was a cemetery rather than a dwelling place, the conclusion that hundreds of people lived there would not be supported.

2. The second sentence says that if a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.

Now let's consider each answer choice:
A. A listed company does not need financing, or is not a company with dividends.
   This statement follows logically from the given information. If a company has dividends, it does not need financing (sentence 2). And if it needs financing, it cannot have dividends (sentence 3).
B. A listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends. 
   This is not necessarily true. A listed company may not need financing and may have dividends.
C. A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends.
   This statement must be true. If a company has dividends, it does not need funds (sentence 2), so it does not need to issue new stocks. And only companies with dividends can issue new stocks (sentence 1).
D. The only way for a listed company to finance is to issue new stocks.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The argument is that more rich Chinese people are transferring their property abroad, based on the increased transaction volume of Chinese buyers in the US real estate market.
2. To argue against this, we need to find a choice that provides an alternative explanation for the increased transaction volume, or shows the argument is flawed in some way.
3. Choice A suggests that even though the transaction volume increased, the actual number of Chinese buyers may not have increased. This could mean the average purchase amount per buyer went up, rather than more buyers entering the market. This weakens the original argument.
4. Choice C talks about real estate speculation within China, but this doesn't directly address the argument about Chinese buyers in the US market. It's not the most relevant counterargument.
5. Choice D suggests the US market has been low risk recently. While this could be a contributing factor to attracting more Chinese buyers, it doesn't directly argue against the idea that more rich Chinese are moving assets abroad. It's more of a complementary point than a counterargument.

3. Based on condition (3), if X is in sales, then W must be in production. However, we determined X is in production, not sales. Therefore, W does not have to be in production. W could be in either sales or public relations.
4. H and Y must be in the same department according to condition (1). Since there are 3 people in production (including F and X), and 3 people in sales, the only department H and Y can be in together is sales.

A) This supports the expert's view by pointing out the economic impact of large ships being unable to pass the bridge. It does not raise doubts.
B) If 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze moor below the Nanjing Bridge, and ports above it rarely have large ships, this suggests demolishing the bridge may not be necessary, as most large ship traffic is already below it. This raises doubts about the expert's assertion.
C) This also supports the expert's view by noting other bridges also block ship traffic, so demolishing only Nanjing's bridge would be insufficient. It does not raise doubts.
D) If 8000-ton ships designed for the Yangtze have already passed through Nanjing to Wuhan, this directly contradicts the claim that the bridge must be demolished for large ships to pass. This raises significant doubts.

","To explain the seemingly contradictory results, we need to find a statement that provides a plausible reason why people who favor college students as nannies would still not hire them.
A: This doesn't explain the discrepancy, as it only describes the type of work those who would hire college nannies want them to do. It doesn't address why those who favor them still wouldn't hire them.
B: If a majority of respondents are only willing to pay a low salary, this could explain why they wouldn't actually hire college students as nannies, even if they favor the idea in principle. College students may not accept such low pay.
C: This also doesn't explain the discrepancy, as it only describes why people think nannying is good for the students, not why they wouldn't hire them.
D: This is about people who don't approve of college nannies at all, so it doesn't explain why those who do approve still wouldn't hire them.
Therefore, B is the best explanation. If the offered salary is too low, people may like the idea of college nannies but still not actually hire them.

3. Requirement (1) states that Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together. Since Guo Yanran is selected, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected.
4. Requirements (2) and (3) don't provide any additional information, since we already know Tang Xiaohua is not selected.
5. So if He Zhilian is not selected, we can definitively say that Tang Xiaohua will also not be selected. The question doesn't provide enough information to determine which of the other boys will or will not be selected.
Therefore, the correct answer is A: If He Zhilian is not selected, Tang Xiaohua will also not be selected.

","Let's think through this step-by-step:
A: This is a valid doubt. It points out the circular reasoning in using sensory evidence, which itself presupposes an external world, to prove the external world exists. This challenges the argument.
B: Also a reasonable doubt. The argument assumes others have similar visual experiences, but provides no proof for this claim. Questioning this assumption pokes a hole in the reasoning.
C: This choice does not challenge the argument, but rather supports it illogically. Claiming mirages are real because visual experiences are reliable is faulty logic that actually aligns with the flawed reasoning in the original argument. So this is not a rebuttal.
D: This brings up the practical success of natural science as evidence for an external world that science describes. While not definitively proving an external world, it at least provides a reasonable counter-argument to pure skepticism. So it does present some challenge to the original argument's certainty.

1. If H is in Team 2, then G must be in Team 1 (since one of them must be in front).
2. If H is in Team 2, then Q must be in the middle of Team 1 (given condition 6).
3. L must be in Team 1 (given condition 3).
4. P cannot be in Team 1, because P cannot be with Q (given condition 5).
5. N cannot be in Team 1, because N cannot be with Q (inferred from conditions 4 and 2 - N can't be with P or K, and K must be in the middle if playing, so N can't be with Q in the middle).
6. So with H in Team 2, the only possible arrangement for Team 1 is:
   Front: L
   Middle: Q
   Back: G
Therefore, the answer is C: Before? L Middle? Q After? G
