This is a flawed assumption because it does not consider the possibility that some auto mechanics with extensive experience may not understand electronic circuits. 
Looking at the choices, the argument in choice A makes a similar flawed assumption. It assumes that because increased automobile traffic leads to increased gas prices and increased gas prices lead to increased consumer complaints, then increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints. This is a flawed assumption because it does not consider other factors that could lead to increased consumer complaints.
