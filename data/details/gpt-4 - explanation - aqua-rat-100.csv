She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)
Choices:
  A: 3

  B: 4
  C: 5

","Thought: 
Amy can use a single letter to represent one type of book and a pair of two different letters to represent another type of book. To minimize the number of letters, she should use as many single letters as possible. However, she can only use a single letter once, so she will need to use pairs of letters for the remaining types of books. 
The number of unique pairs of two different letters that can be created from n letters is given by the formula n(n-1)/2. 
We need to find the smallest number of letters such that the number of single letters plus the number of unique pairs is at least 10. 
If Amy uses 3 letters, she can create 3 single letters and 3(3-1)/2 = 3 pairs, for a total of 6 codes. 
If Amy uses 4 letters, she can create 4 single letters and 4(4-1)/2 = 6 pairs, for a total of 10 codes. 
Therefore, Amy will need at least 4 letters to create the codes for all 10 types of books.
Action: Answer(""B"")","The question asks for the smallest value of n, such that (n + nC2) = 10 (n represents the number of letters. In this equation, n by itself is for single-letter codes and nC2 is for two-letter codes).
At this point, you'd need to pick numbers, since there's really no easy way to solve nC2 = (10 – n) without a calculator.
Looking at the answer choices, you can eliminate 10 and 20, so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test. (i.e. (10 – n) suggests n can not be less than 10.)
As a general rule, whenever you're asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition, start by testing the smallest number in the answers. Conversely, if you're asked for the largest value, start with the greatest answer.
Plug-in n=4 to (n + nC2) = (4 + 4C2) = 4 + (4x3 /2) = (4 + 6) = 10 ANS:D",B,D,0,503,234,737,

The diameter of each semicircle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm.
The area of a semicircle is (1/2)πr^2 = (1/2)π(10)^2 = 50π cm^2.
Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is 2*50π = 100π cm^2.
The remaining area of the paper is the area of the square minus the area of the semicircles = 400 - 100π cm^2.

Each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are x pickets, so the total width of the pickets is 1/2x inches. 
There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, but there is no space after the last picket. So, there are (x-1) spaces, each of 6 inches, which is 6(x-1) inches.
The total length of the fence in inches is 1/2x + 6(x-1).
To convert this length to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
So, the length of the fence in feet is (1/2x + 6(x-1))/12 = (x + 6x - 6)/24 = (7x - 6)/24.
This simplifies to (7x/24) - (6/24) = (7x/24) - (1/4).

First, we need to find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy. 
For alloy X, the ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. This means that out of 15 parts (6+9), 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper. Since we have 40 grams of alloy X, each part is equal to 40/15 = 2.67 grams. Therefore, alloy X contains 6*2.67 = 16 grams of zinc and 9*2.67 = 24 grams of copper.
For alloy Y, the ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11. This means that out of 18 parts (7+11), 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. Since we have 60 grams of alloy Y, each part is equal to 60/18 = 3.33 grams. Therefore, alloy Y contains 7*3.33 = 23.31 grams of zinc and 11*3.33 = 36.63 grams of copper.
When we melt and mix alloy X and alloy Y to form alloy Z, the total amount of zinc is 16 + 23.31 = 39.31 grams and the total amount of copper is 24 + 36.63 = 60.63 grams.
The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is therefore 39.31:60.63. To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is approximately 0.67. This gives us a ratio of approximately 59:91.

","Thought: 
The expression x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) simplifies to x = n + 4. 
Given that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, the range of x would be 40 ≤ x ≤ 76. 
None of the given options match this range. 
Action: Answer(""E"")","36 ≤ n ≤ 72
x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4)
Put x = 36,
x = (362 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36+ 4√36+ 4)

","Thought: 
The sum of 5 consecutive odd numbers is 5 times the middle number. This sum, when divided by 10, should be a perfect square. So, the middle number should be a multiple of 2 and end with a 0 or 5. Among the choices, only 40 and 45 are possible middle numbers. But 40 is not an odd number, so the middle number must be 45. The five numbers are 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. So, the possible numbers from the choices are 41 and 47.

The question states that Susan must be to the left of Tim. This leaves two possible arrangements: Susan, Tim, Zen and Zen, Susan, Tim. Therefore, there are 2 ways to arrange the children.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Total ways in which 3 children can be arranged on 3 chairs = 3*2*1 = 6
But in half cases Susan will be left of Tim and in other half of cases Tim will be on left of Susan

The problem states that if you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator travels the remaining distance in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator travels the remaining distance in 20 minutes. The difference in the number of steps walked is 10, and the difference in time is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 10 steps/10 minutes = 1 step/minute.

If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:

","Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75
","Thought: 
Let's denote the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday as x. Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. The cost for Sunday newspapers is 2x * $4 = $8x. The cost for newspapers for the rest of the week (Monday to Saturday) is x * $1 * 6 = $6x. The total cost for newspapers per week is $8x + $6x = $14x. Given that the total cost per week is $210, we can set up the equation $14x = $210 and solve for x. 
Action: 
Solving the equation $14x = $210 gives x = $210 / $14 = 15. Therefore, the hotel buys 15 newspapers on Monday. 
Answer(""A"")","Number of paper bought on monday = x
# of paper bought on sunday = 2x
Total cost = 210 = 6*x(rest of the day cost)+8*x (sunday cost)
14x = 210
x = 15

","Choices:
  A: 60 m
  B: 61 m
  C: 62 m
  D: 63 m
  E: 64 m
","Thought: 
The area of a rectangle is given by the formula length * breadth = area. 
Given that the area is 150 sq m and the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, we can set up the equation as follows: breadth * (4*breadth + 1) = 150.
Solving this equation gives the breadth as 5m and the length as 4*5 + 1 = 21m.
The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula 2*(length + breadth).
So, the perimeter is 2*(21 + 5) = 52m.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Let its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 mLet its breadth be = x m.
So length will be = (4x+1) m.
Now,
x * (4x+1) = 150
or, 4x^2+x-150 = 0
or, (4x+25)(x-6) = 0
Either 4x = -25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4*6+1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2*(25+6)=62 m
