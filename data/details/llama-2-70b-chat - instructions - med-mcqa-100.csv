Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A, 2 ATP + 2 NAD.
Upon reflection, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of attention to detail.
I misunderstood the question and thought it was asking about the energy yield from glycolysis, rather than the end product.
I also failed to consider the conditions of anaerobic glycolysis, which result in the reduction of pyruvate to lactate.

Correct answer: C

Explanation:
Anaerobic glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that occurs in the absence of oxygen.
It starts with glucose and ends with lactate, producing 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is lactate, which is produced by the reduction of pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase.
Therefore, the correct answer is choice C, 2 ATP + 2 NADH.

I previously answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the term ""expansile type osseous metastases."" I thought it referred to any type of bone metastasis, but it specifically refers to a type of metastasis that expands the bone, creating a characteristic ""sunburst"" or ""spiculated"" radiographic appearance.

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
Expansile type osseous metastases are characteristic of primary malignancies that have a high propensity for bone metastasis. Breast cancer is one of the primary malignancies that frequently present with expansile type osseous metastases. The radiographic appearance of expansile type osseous metastases is consistent with the ""sunburst"" or ""spiculated"" pattern, which is pathognomonic of breast cancer metastasis. Therefore, the best answer is option C, Breast.

Elimination:

Option A, Kidney: Kidney cancer rarely metastasizes to bone, and when it does, it typically presents with lytic lesions rather than expansile type osseous metastases.

Option B, Bronchus: Lung cancer may metastasize to bone, but it does not typically present with expansile type osseous metastases. The radiographic appearance of lung cancer metastases is typically lytic or mixed (lytic and sclerotic).

Option D, Prostate: Prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to bone, but it typically presents with lytic lesions rather than expansile type osseous metastases. The radiographic appearance of prostate cancer metastases is typically lytic or osteoblastic.

Reflection:
In my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I should have chosen option C, Methimazole.

To answer this question, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the antithyroid drug that is safe to use during pregnancy.

Research shows that Methimazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. Although it does cross the placenta, it has not been linked to an increased risk of congenital abnormalities.

2. Research the safety profile of each antithyroid drug.

Propylthiouracil (option A) has been associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities, including aplastic anemia and choanal atresia.

I121 (option B) is not a commonly used antithyroid drug, and its safety profile during pregnancy is not well established.

Carbimazole (option D) is metabolized to Methimazole, which is why it is not considered safe for use during pregnancy.

3. Choose the drug with the lowest risk of adverse effects during pregnancy.

Based on the available research, Methimazole (option C) has the lowest risk of adverse effects during pregnancy.

Action: Answer(""C"")","This question has been repeated several times before. Remember these important points. 
All antithyroid drugs can cross placenta so risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitre is always there. Both carbimazole and propylthiouracil can be used during pregnancy, but propylthiouracil is the drug of choice because its greater protein binding allows low doses of propylthiouracil to be transferred across the placenta and therefore less chance of hypothyroidism. 
The lowest effective dose of propylthiouracil should be given and it is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester since TSH Receptor antibodies tend to decline in pregnancy.

A 60-year-old male complains of right-sided nasal obstruction and nasal discharge, which sometimes is blood-tinged. The patient has a history of smoking and exposure to dust and pollen.

Upon physical examination, there is a mass in the right nasal cavity, and the nasal mucosa is erythematous and swollen.

A biopsy is performed, and the results show:

[REDACTED]

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is:

A: Rhinoscleroma

Rhinoscleroma is a rare, chronic granulomatous disease that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is caused by the bacteria Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. The symptoms of rhinoscleroma include nasal obstruction, nasal discharge (which may be blood-tinged), and facial pain or swelling. The patient's history of smoking and exposure to dust and pollen may also contribute to the development of the disease.

The biopsy results show non-caseating granulomas, which are characteristic of rhinoscleroma. The disease is typically treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement of the nasal cavity.

Therefore, the answer is A: Rhinoscleroma.

Reflection:
In my previous answer, I mistakenly diagnosed the patient with Wegener's granulomatosis. Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic disease that affects multiple organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and sinuses. It is characterized by the presence of granulomas and is often associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).

Although the patient's symptoms of nasal obstruction and bloody nasal discharge are consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis, the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. The presence of non-caseating granulomas is not typical of Wegener's granulomatosis, which usually presents with caseating granulomas.

I also considered Stewa's granuloma, which is a rare condition that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. However, Stewa's granuloma typically presents with a unilateral nasal mass and does not have the same histopathological features as rhinoscleroma.

Rhinosporidiosis is a rare fungal infection that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is caused by the fungus Rhinosporidium seeberi. Although the patient's symptoms of nasal obstruction and bloody nasal discharge are consistent with rhinosporidiosis, the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. Rhinosporidiosis typically presents with numerous fungal spores within the nasal mucosa, which are not seen in the biopsy results.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and biopsy results is rhinoscleroma.","RhinosporidiosisIt is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals.The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynxThe disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals. In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint.Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals.Treatment:Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base. Recurrence may occur after surgical excision. Not many drugs are effective against the disease. Dapsone has been tried with some success.Ref: Dhingra; 6th ed; Pg: 159",,D,0,580,743,1323,

3. Pr[REDACTED]tice identifying the type of hypersensitivity re[REDACTED]tion given a description of a condition.

Answer: b) Type II hypersensitivity reaction.

Explanation:
Spring catarrh is an allergic condition that occurs in response to pollen exposure. It is a type II hypersensitivity reaction, also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity. In this reaction, the immune system produces antibodies that bind to the surface of cells, leading to their destruction. In the case of spring catarrh, the antibodies target the pollen-sensitized cells in the nasal mucosa, leading to inflammation and the symptoms of the condition.

Type I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate reactions that occur within minutes to hours of exposure to an allergen. They are mediated by IgE antibodies and result in symptoms such as itching, hives, and difficulty breathing.

Type III hypersensitivity reactions are immune complex reactions that occur when antigens and antibodies combine to form immune complexes. These complexes deposit in tissues and activate the immune system, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.

Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that occur within 24-48 hours of exposure to an allergen. They are mediated by T-cells and result in symptoms such as skin rashes and delayed reactions to drugs.

Type V hypersensitivity reactions are autoimmune reactions that occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. They are not associated with allergic reactions and do not play a role in spring catarrh.

Therefore, the correct answer is b) Type II hypersensitivity reaction.",,,B,0,507,640,1147,

2. Understand the association between [REDACTED] and cholangiocarcinoma.
3. Recognize that [REDACTED] is a congenital disorder that affects the liver and bile ducts.
4. Identify the correct answer, [REDACTED], [REDACTED].

Answer: B

Explanation:

Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer that originates from the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts within the liver. Several risk factors have been linked to the development of this disease, including Caroli disease, a congenital disorder that affects the liver and bile ducts. Caroli disease is characterized by the dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which can lead to chronic inflammation and increase the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.

In contrast, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, and ulcerative colitis are not directly associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. While pancreatitis may increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, pyelonephritis is a urinary tract infection that does not affect the liver or bile ducts, and ulcerative colitis is a condition that affects the large intestine and does not have a direct connection to cholangiocarcinoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Caroli disease.","Ans. is 'b' i.e., Caroli disease Cholangiocarcinoma o Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignancy of the biliary tree, arising from bile ducts within or outside the liver, o Risk factors All risk factors for cholangiocarcinomas cause chronic inflammation and cholestasis, which presumably promote the occurrence of somatic mutations or epigenetic alterations in cholangiocytes.

Reflection:
In my previous response, I incorrectly answered this question. I mistakenly chose option D, Salicylic acid, which is actually a commonly used agent in chemical peeling.

To correctly answer this question, I will follow these steps:

1. Review the list of commonly used agents in chemical peeling: Glycolic acid, Kojic acid, Phenol, and Salicylic acid.
2. Ensure I understand the properties and uses of each agent:
	* Glycolic acid: An alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells, revealing smoother, brighter skin.
	* Kojic acid: A natural compound that inhibits melanin production, often used to lighten skin and reduce pigmentation.
	* Phenol: A strong agent that can remove both the outer layer and the middle layer of skin, used for deeper peels.
	* Salicylic acid: A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that exfoliates the skin, unclogs pores, and reduces inflammation.
3. Carefully read the question and choices:
The question asks which option is not an agent used in chemical peeling.
4. Eliminate any answer choices that do not match the description in the question:
	* Option D, Salicylic acid, is a commonly used agent in chemical peeling, so it cannot be the correct answer.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4.

Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions.

  D: Subtle

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I needed to further my knowledge of seizures in newborns.

Action: Answer(""D"")

Explanation:
Subtle seizures are the most common type of seizure in newborns. They are characterized by subtle signs and symptoms, such as a brief loss of muscle tone, a blank stare, or a slight tremor. These seizures can be easily missed, and it is essential to recognize their importance and seek prompt medical evaluation and treatment for newborns with seizures.

In contrast, clonic seizures are characterized by rhythmic jerking movements of the limbs, while tonic seizures are characterized by a sudden increase in muscle tone. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches. While these types of seizures can also occur in newborns, they are less common than subtle seizures.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Subtle.","Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Neonatal seizures: Usual onset at 12-48 hours. Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

The correct answer is (D) Two weeks before the symptoms and two weeks thereafter.

Explanation:
Hepatitis A virus shedding in faeces occurs two weeks before symptoms appear and continues for up to two weeks after symptoms appear. This means that the virus is shed in faeces for a total of four weeks, with two weeks before and two weeks after symptoms appear. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Two weeks before the symptoms and two weeks thereafter.

It's important to note that the virus shedding in faeces can occur even before the individual shows any symptoms, which is why it's important to practice good hygiene practices, such as washing hands after using the bathroom and before handling food, to prevent the spread of the virus.

In summary, the correct answer is (D) Two weeks before the symptoms and two weeks thereafter, as this option accurately reflects the timeline of Hepatitis A virus shedding in faeces.",,D,D,1,523,231,754,

Reflection:
Previously, I answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: Infection. However, upon further review, I realized that the correct answer is option C: Fistula.

Cyst-gastrostomy is a surgical procedure that aims to drain a pseudo pancreatic cyst by creating a connection between the cyst and the stomach. One of the major complications of this procedure is the formation of a fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two organs or between an organ and the skin.

A fistula can develop when the communication between the cyst and the stomach is not properly established or when there is a defect in the closure of the gastrostomy site. This can lead to a persistent leak of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis, sepsis, and other life-threatening complications.

Therefore, option C: Fistula is the correct answer.

1. The facial artery originates from the external carotid artery.
2. The infraorbital artery is a branch of the maxillary artery, which is also a branch of the external carotid artery.
3. The facial artery and infraorbital artery anastomose (connect) with each other.
4. The maxillary artery supplies blood to the maxilla and other structures in the face, but it is not involved in the anastomosis with the facial artery.

A. Opposite side of the facial artery: This choice is incorrect because the facial artery does not anastomose with itself.

B. Transverse facial artery: This choice is incorrect because there is no such artery as the transverse facial artery.

C. Anastomosis with Infraorbital artery: This choice is correct! The facial artery anastomoses with the infraorbital artery.

","  I apologize for my previous mistake. After reflecting on the question, I realized that my mistake was due to a lack of knowledge about breast tumors and their symptoms.

The commonest cause of blood discharge from the nipple is duct papilloma. Duct papilloma is a benign tumor that develops in the milk ducts of the breast. It can cause nipple discharge, which may be clear, yellow, or blood-stained. Duct papilloma is usually diagnosed through a combination of clinical examination, mammography, and ductography.

On the other hand, ductal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that develops in the milk ducts of the breast. It can also cause nipple discharge, which is often bloody or clear. However, ductal carcinoma is usually associated with other symptoms such as a breast lump, skin changes, or changes in the nipple.

Chronic cystic mastitis is a condition where the breast tissue becomes inflamed, leading to the formation of cysts. It can cause nipple discharge, but it is not the most common cause of blood discharge from the nipple.

Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a rare type of breast tumor that grows in the connective tissue of the breast. It can cause nipple discharge, but it is not the most common cause of blood discharge from the nipple.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B: Duct papilloma. I have taken the time to review the different types of breast tumors and their symptoms, and I am now familiar with the term ""duct papilloma"" and its association with nipple discharge.

The branches of the intracranial ICA include:

* Anterior communicating artery (AComm)
* Anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
* Middle cerebral artery (MCA)

B: Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist that increases aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork by enhancing the activity of the ciliary muscles. This results in increased contraction of the ciliary muscles, which facilitates aqueous humor outflow.

C: Brimonidine is an alpha-agonist that increases aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork. It works by increasing the contraction force of the ciliary muscles, which helps to push aqueous humor out of the eye.

D: Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces aqueous humor production. Like timolol, it does not directly affect the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork.

Explanation:
The correct answer is D: MRI. Although MRI is a valuable imaging tool for many musculoskeletal conditions, it is not the most useful investigation for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. The slippage of the vertebra can be best visualized on X-rays, either anteroposterior or lateral view. Therefore, options A and B are both useful investigations for diagnosing Spondylolisthesis. CT scans can also be helpful in some cases, but they are not as sensitive as X-rays for detecting early slippage.

Question: 'Liver shrinkage diet' is advised before
Choices:
  A: Liver resections
  B: Whipple's procedure
  C: Bariatric surgery
  D: Biliary surgery

Reflection:
Previously, I incorrectly answered this question. After reflecting on the problem, I realized that the ""Liver shrinkage diet"" is actually used to reduce the risk of complications in bariatric surgery. Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Bariatric surgery.

Action: Answer(""C"")","In bariatric surgery, 'liver shrinkage diet' for at least 2 weeks before surgery is advised, especially when there is central obesity, as this is associated with large livers that can make surgery impossible.Ref: Bailey and love 27e pg: 1146",C,C,1,491,144,635,

I incorrectly answered the question because I was not familiar with the branching pattern of the external carotid artery and its branches. I also didn't pay close attention to the anatomical structures in the head and neck when studying.

Action: Answer(""A"")

The middle meningeal artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery.

Reflection:
This time, I carefully reviewed the branching pattern of the external carotid artery and its branches. I also studied the anatomy of the maxillary artery and its branches. Additionally, I familiarized myself with the course and distribution of the middle meningeal artery. By doing so, I was able to correctly identify the branch that the middle meningeal artery arises from.",Middle meningeal artery is a branch of the first part of the maxillary artery given off in the infratemporal fossa.

Question: A girl about to marry has comedonal acne. Drug to treat such a case is:
Choices:
  A: Topical antibiotic
  B: Benzoyl peroxide
  C: Retinoids
  D: Estrogen

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. After reflecting on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer, I realized that I misunderstood the type of acne the patient had. Comedonal acne is characterized by clogged pores and blackheads, and the best treatment is a topical retinoid. Retinoids are derived from vitamin A and help to unclog pores and prevent new comedones from forming.

Action: Answer(""C"")

Explanation:
The correct answer is C: Retinoids. Retinoids are topical medications that are effective in treating comedonal acne by reducing comedone formation and helping to unclog pores. They are also useful in reducing fine lines and wrinkles, making them a popular choice for patients who want to improve the appearance of their skin.

It's important to note that topical antibiotics (choice A) are effective in treating acne by reducing the bacterial load on the skin, but they are not as effective in treating comedonal acne as retinoids. Benzoyl peroxide (choice B) is a common over-the-counter treatment for acne, but it can be drying and irritating to the skin, especially in patients with sensitive skin. Estrogen (choice D) is not a recommended treatment for acne, as it can worsen acne in some cases.","Retinoids are mainly comedolytic Acne Comedones are characteristic of: Acne vulgaris Comedones are: * Small cysts, * formed in hair follicles, * due to blockage of the follicular orifice * by the retention of sebum and keratinous material.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. After reviewing the different types of fungal infections and their synonyms, I realized that Gilchrist's disease is actually Sporotrichosis. The fungus that causes this infection is Sporothrix schenckii. I will memorize the correct answer by repeating it several times: Sporotrichosis, Sporotrichosis, Sporotrichosis.

Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
","Choices:
  A: Levodopa
  B: Benserazide
  C: Selegiline
  D: Biperiden
","  Sure, here's my refection on the previous answer:

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A, Levodopa. However, upon further review, I realized that Levodopa actually works by increasing dopamine levels, not by decreasing cholinergic activity.

The correct answer is option C, Selegiline. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that selectively inhibits the breakdown of dopamine in the brain, leading to increased dopamine levels. Additionally, Selegiline has been shown to decrease brain cholinergic activity, which can help alleviate Parkinson's symptoms such as tremors and rigidity.

I will make sure to carefully review the mechanism of action of each drug and pay close attention to the specific action of each drug to ensure that I select the correct answer this time.

Action: Answer(""C"")",An antiparkinson medication is a type of drug which is intended to treat and relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Most of these agents act by either increasing dopamine activity or reducing acetylcholine activity in the central nervous system. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.,C,D,0,488,212,700,
