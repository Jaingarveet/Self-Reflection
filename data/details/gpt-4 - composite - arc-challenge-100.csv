Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought: 
The question asks which materials can be reused many times. While all the options can be recycled, not all of them can be reused many times in the same form. Glass bottles can be cleaned and sterilized, then reused many times without losing their quality or integrity.

Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
Frost is formed when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas to a solid, a process known as deposition. However, deposition is a type of sublimation, which is the transition of a substance directly from the gas phase to the solid phase.

  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence

Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
The scientific method involves forming a hypothesis, conducting an experiment, and then analyzing the results. If the results do not match the hypothesis, the experiment should be repeated to ensure the results were not due to experimental error. Only after repeated inconsistent results should the hypothesis be reconsidered.
