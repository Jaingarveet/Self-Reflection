The authors of Passage 1 argue that women are naturally suited to the roles of motherhood and running a household, and that these roles are distinct from those of men. They do not suggest that these roles are less valuable, easy, or require similar skills to running a country or a business. They do not mention men performing these roles.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer.

The passage starts with Ken Dial observing a pattern in young birds. He then designs an experiment to study this pattern further. However, a local rancher advises him to modify his experiment setup, which he does. This leads to an unexpected finding that the birds use their wings and legs cooperatively. This observation leads to a new series of experiments and the proposal of a novel hypothesis, WAIR. Therefore, the sequence of events is: observation, experiment design, modification of experiment, unexpected finding, new experiments, and novel hypothesis.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The author explains that Ken Dial created an experiment to study the evolution of flight by observing how baby Chukars learn to fly. During the experiment, Dial noticed the unusual way Chukars use their ""'wings and legs cooperatively'"" to scale hay bales (lines 38-43), and he created ""a series of ingenious experiments"" (line 46) to study this observation. After his additional experiments, Dial determined that these baby birds angle ""their wings differently from birds in flight"" (lines 49-50).Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and $\mathrm{C}$ are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the sequence of events in the passage.",D,D,1,1310,115,1425,

","Thought: 
The narrator is observant and attentive to her surroundings. She tries to remember everything so she can tell GaoLing later. She notices the cleanliness of the shop, the state of the display cases, and the appearance of their silk-wrapped boxes. She also pays attention to her father's words and actions. This suggests that she is attuned to her immediate surroundings.
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because the passage doesn't state or imply that Old Widow Lau is exhausted from her journey.",B,A,0,1269,84,1353,

","Thought: 
The passage does not provide any information on how the presence of crops like wheat or corn would affect the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds. However, it does mention that no crops were planted in these pilot experiments to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds. This suggests that the presence of crops might have some effect on the growth of weeds. However, without specific information on how crops would affect weed growth, it is reasonable to assume that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely be comparable to Hartmann's original projection.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",D,A,0,1526,121,1647,

The first paragraph discusses Akira's direct approach to Chie, breaking tradition. It questions whether Chie would have been more receptive if Akira had followed the traditional approach. Therefore, the main purpose of the paragraph is to question a suggestion.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",C,D,0,1407,58,1465,
