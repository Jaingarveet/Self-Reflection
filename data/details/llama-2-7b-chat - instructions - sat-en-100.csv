","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A: Douglas proposes changes to federal policies on slavery, but Lincoln argues that such changes would enjoy no popular support. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer does not accurately capture the central tension between the two passages.

The correct answer is choice C: Douglas criticizes Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution, and Lincoln argues that this criticism misrepresents his position. In Passage 1, Douglas accuses Lincoln of violating the law of God by criticizing the Constitution, which he sees as a sacred document. In Passage 2, Lincoln responds by arguing that Douglas misinterprets his position and that he is not attacking the Constitution, but rather the principle of slavery.

Therefore, the central tension between the two passages is the disagreement between Douglas and Lincoln over the interpretation of the Constitution and its relationship to slavery. Douglas sees the Constitution as a fixed and unchanging document, while Lincoln believes that it can be adapted and changed to address the issue of slavery. This disagreement lies at the heart of their differing views on the future of the Union and the role of slavery in it.","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the first paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas claims that Lincoln considers the Constitution to be ""a house divided against itself,"" due to its provisions for the division of the nation into slave states and free states, and to be ""in violation of the law of God."" In Passage 2, Lincoln objects to this characterization of his position and devotes the majority of the passage to clarifying that it isn't the Constitution he finds fault with, or even its provisions for slavery, but rather with attempts to spread slavery to regions where it isn't currently practiced. Therefore it can be said that a central tension between the two passages arises from, on the one hand, Douglas's criticism of Lincoln for finding fault with the Constitution and, on the other, Lincoln's insistence that Douglas has misrepresented his position.Choice A is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1 ) proposes no changes to federal policies on slavery and because Lincoln (Passage 2) doesn't consider whether changes to such policies would enjoy popular support. Choice B is incorrect because Douglas (Passage 1) never expresses concern about the potential impact of abolition on the US economy and because Lincoln (Passage 2 ) neither discusses such an impact nor dismisses concerns about it. Choice D is incorrect because neither passage offers any interpretation of federal law.",,C,0,1397,266,1663,

1. The Quabarl children are described as being delicate, sensitive, and having the artistic temperament highly developed. They are also said to be ""something or other else of a mould equally commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century.""
2. The correct answer is (B) unusually creative and intelligent.

Reasoning:

The passage suggests that the Quabarl children are not typical of their peers. They are described as being delicate and sensitive, which are not typically associated with children who are more robust and rough-and-tumble. Additionally, their artistic temperament is also unusual, as it is not common for children of their age to have such a developed interest in the arts. This suggests that they are more creative and intelligent than most children of their age.

The passage also highlights the fact that Mrs. Quabarl is looking for a governess who can ""make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory."" This suggests that the Quabarl children are not only intelligent but also have a deep appreciation for history and learning.

In contrast, options (A) and (C) are not supported by the passage. Option (A) is unlikely because the passage does not suggest that the Quabarl children are similar to many of their peers. Option (C) is also unlikely because the passage does not indicate that the children are hostile to the idea of a governess.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) unusually creative and intelligent.","Choice A is the best answer. Lady Carlotta learns about Mrs. Quabarl's children Claude, Wilfrid, and Irene (lines 53-58).

The results showed that only the insular cortex, which processes emotion, was active when brushing G.L.'s arm, which supports the conclusion that CT fibers convey emotional sensations.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) the role played by CT fibers in the perception of emotional sensations.","Choice A is the best answer.

""The main purpose of the passage is to emphasize the value of a tradition.""
However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage actually stresses the urgency of an issue. The author emphasizes the importance of thinking and making decisions about the procession of educated men, as the moment of transition is short and the choices they make will have a significant impact on their lives and the lives of future generations. The passage creates a sense of urgency and importance around the need for the author and their peers to think critically and make informed decisions about their place in the procession of educated men. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) stress the urgency of an issue.","Choice B is the best answer. In this passage, Woolf asks women a series of questions. Woolf wants women to consider joining ""the procession of educated men"" (lines 56-57) by becoming members of the workforce. Woolf stresses that this issue is urgent, as women ""have very little time in which to answer [these questions]"" (lines 48-49).Choice $A$ is incorrect because Woolf argues against the tradition of only ""the sons of educated men"" (lines 82-83) joining the workforce. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because Woolf is not highlighting the severity of social divisions as much as she is explaining how those divisions might be reduced (with women joining the workforce).

The passage highlights the limitations placed on women's roles in society and the ways in which they were expected to conform to traditional gender roles. The authors argue that these limitations were based on outdated ideas about gender and that society has since evolved to recognize the importance of gender equality.

Although the authors generally disagree about the roles men and women should occupy, both Tocqueville and Mill share the idea that gender equality is one small part of a societal shift toward equality in general.

Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither author considers changing gender roles in terms of economic ramifications, focusing instead on questions of fairness and justice and the fulfillment of people's potential.

The author also notes that the resources mined from asteroids could be used in space-based projects, such as fueling spacecraft.

In the second paragraph of Passage 2, Lincoln asserts that the controversy over slavery has historically been ""excited by the effort to spread [slavery] into new territory,"" as in the case of Missouri, Texas, and ""the territory acquired by the Mexican War.""

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.

I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

A: reserved around unfamiliar people.

Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. Then I reflected on the problem, my solution, and the correct answer. I realized that the narrator is not reserved around unfamiliar people, but rather attuned to her immediate surroundings. She notices everything around her, from the clean floors of the shop to the display cases of inksticks, and listens intently to Father's words of wisdom. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) attuned to her immediate surroundings.","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit.

Reflection:

Initial answer: I initially answered the question incorrectly, selecting choice ""A"" as the correct answer. However, upon further reflection, I realized that the passage suggests that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would likely result in a higher percentage of the surface covered with weeds than what Hartmann found. This is because these crops would compete with the weeds for resources such as light, water, and nutrients, leading to a lower percentage of weed coverage.

Correct answer: Based on the information provided in the passage, the correct answer is choice ""B"". The passage states that ""more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds,"" indicating that the percentage of weed coverage was higher than what Hartmann had predicted. This suggests that planting wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips would likely result in an even higher percentage of weed coverage.","Choice A is the best answer. The sixth paragraph describes an experiment conducted by Karl Hartmann with the help of farmer Karl Seydel. Seydel plowed one strip of land during the day and the other at night to see what effect this had on weed growth. However, ""no crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds."" Thus the passage suggests that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.Choice B is incorrect. If Seydel had planted wheat or corn crops on the two agricultural strips, the percentage of weeds wouldn't have been higher than the percentage predicted because competition with the crops would have prevented some weed growth. Choice $C$ is incorrect because a reduction in weed growth would have been easily observable, not nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect. Hartmann's original projection was that plowing at night wouldn't provide more effective weed control. Therefore, the dramatic drop in the percentage of weeds covering the strip plowed at night wouldn't have been comparable with Hartmann's original projection, regardless of whether crops were planted.",B,A,0,1662,215,1877,

My reasoning was that Grimke's central claim in passage 2 is that men and women must learn to work together to improve society. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is incorrect. Grimke's central claim in passage 2 is actually (C) Moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals.

Here is my reflection on my previous answer:
I realized that my previous answer was incorrect after re-reading Grimke's passage and paying closer attention to the language and arguments used. While Grimke does discuss the importance of men and women working together to improve society, her central claim is actually about the nature of moral rights and their basis in human dignity.

[REDACTED]

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Moral rights are the most important distinction between human beings and animals.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. In Passage 2, Grimké makes the main point that people have rights because they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58-60, when Grimké states that ""human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature"" and lines 65-68, when Grimké writes, ""Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman.""Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimké primarily emphasizes that all men and women inherently have the same rights (""rights are founded in the nature of our moral being,"" lines 65-66).

I previously answered question 4 as follows:
Answer(""C"")
However, upon reviewing the passage, I realized that the correct answer is (D) conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.
The passage states that CT fibers specifically provide pleasurable sensations, indicating that the emotional aspect of touch is distinct from the conscious aspect. The brain's insular cortex, which processes emotion, is activated when CT fibers are stimulated, while the somatosensory and insular cortices are activated in normal subjects. This suggests that the conscious aspects of sensation are not the primary source of the emotional aspect of touch.
Therefore, the correct answer is (D) conscious aspects of sensation are ignored.","Choice B is the best answer. According to the last paragraph, Olausson's 1999 research, in which CT fibers were stimulated, ""solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch."" Hence humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when CT fibers are exposed to a stimulus, according to the passage.Choice A is incorrect because the passage doesn't indicate that humans experience an emotional aspect of touch when brain cortices are shielded from nerve signals. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the suppression of G.L.'s pain-sensing fibers did help Olausson study CT fibers in isolation and determine that they transmit an emotional aspect of touch, but the passage doesn't suggest that suppressing these fibers is what allows humans to experience this emotional aspect of touch. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because the passage indicates that CT fibers transmit an emotional aspect of touch rather than conscious aspects of sensation, not that humans must ignore the conscious aspects of sensation in order to experience the emotional aspects of touch.",C,B,0,1575,162,1737,

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: affection but not genuine love. However, upon further reflection, I realize that Akira's address to Chie is more aligned with option C: amusement but not mocking disparagement.

Additionally, Chie's reaction to Akira's proposal, as well as Naomi's subsequent decision to pursue him, suggest that Akira's approach was not dismissive or mocking. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: amusement but not mocking disparagement.

He observed that young birds in the wild prefer to rest on elevated perches, such as ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches, where they are safe from predators. However, in his controlled research setting, he found that young birds were using their legs to climb up hay bales instead of flying up to perches.

Later in the paragraph, the passage states that ""the young man"" Mr. Peters once was ""had never for one second deserted"" him (lines 90-91). The main idea of the last paragraph is that Mr. Peters still thinks of himself as young, or at least acts as if he is a younger version of himself.Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is incorrect because Mr. Peters is spending time with Lymie, his son, and there is no indication that he generally does not spend time with his family.

","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting option A: has renounced all desire for money.

The passage states that as Eppie grows and develops, Silas' ""soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness"" (para. 45). This suggests that Silas is becoming more open to new experiences and perspectives, including the idea of accepting help from others. Additionally, the passage notes that Silas is ""puzzled"" by Eppie's mischievous behavior, indicating that he is struggling to navigate this new aspect of their relationship (para. 65).

Passage 2 argues against the idea that women's duties are limited to the domestic sphere and that they cannot participate in public debates or exert coercive influences.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $A$ is the best answer. While Beecher and Grimké clearly disagree regarding a woman's role in society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and responsibilities in society. In Passage 1 , Beecher writes that ""while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all-pervading"" (lines 6-10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 2, Grimké asserts that all people ""are moral beings"" (lines 58-59) and that both men and women have ""rights and responsibilities"" (line 68). She concludes that ""whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do"" (lines 81-83).Choice $B$ is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because neither passage discusses the value given to women's ethical obligations, although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations.

The passage states that Sempere gave the narrator ""the best gift I have ever received"" and that he considered Sempere to be a ""lifelong friend"" (lines 60 and 65). This language suggests that Sempere's gift held a special significance for the narrator and that he valued Sempere's opinion and friendship. Additionally, the passage notes that Sempere was a friend of the book's author, Charles Dickens, which further underscores the idea that Sempere's gift was a symbol of his high regard for the narrator.

I mistakenly selected option (B) an exchange between strangers to a satisfying personal relationship. While there are some interactions between characters in the passage, the primary focus is on Lymie's thoughts and observations, rather than an exchange between strangers leading to a personal relationship.

The passage highlights the vastness of the United States and its natural resources, which are seen as a blessing from God. Beveridge argues that these resources have enabled the United States to become a powerful nation and to fulfill its destiny as a beacon of liberty and democracy. This interpretation is supported by the language used in the passage, which emphasizes the idea of a divine gift or blessing.

I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice (A) Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor. However, upon further reflection, I realize that this answer is not supported by the text.

In the first passage, Tocqueville states that ""improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner."" (Paragraph 30) This suggests that Tocqueville believes that an individual's position in society should be determined by their unique abilities and talents, rather than their sex.

In the second passage, Mill argues that ""the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to."" (Paragraph 65) She believes that each individual should have the freedom to choose their own occupation, without arbitrary limits based on their sex or class. This suggests that Mill believes that an individual's position in society should be determined by their abilities and interests, rather than their sex.

Therefore, the best answer is choice (C) Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.","Choice $\mathrm{A}$ is the best answer. In Passage 1 , Tocqueville argues that equality is generally beneficial for society, but he moderates that claim in the third paragraph by further stating that even if men and women should be considered equal, they should not work in the same jobs: ""As nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties."" In contrast, Mill argues in the second paragraph of Passage 2 that men and women should be awarded work based on individual ability: ""Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them."" It can therefore be said that Tocqueville believes one's gender should play a determining factor in one's position in society, whereas Mill believes it should not.Choice B is incorrect because both Tocqueville in Passage 1 and Mill in Passage 2 would likely argue against limiting an individual to the social class he or she was born to. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because it is Mill, not Tocqueville, who argues that individual temperament is the proper determining factor for social position. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because although it accurately represents Tocqueville's implicit stance that an individual's social position should contribute to society as a whole, it misrepresents Mill's argument, which conceives of social position in relation to individual aptitude, not individual satisfaction.",C,A,0,1528,330,1858,

Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even I could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them—apart from the letters he could not decipher—that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window.""If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."" My father was not a miser and, despite the hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book. My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change—if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever. One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full. ""Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,"" I read on the cover. I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them. ""A friend of yours?"" ""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too."" That afternoon I took my new friend home, hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Question: Over the course of the passage, the main focus shifts from a

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The main focus of the passage shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident. The narrator's encounter with Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a pivotal moment in the passage, as it marks the beginning of the narrator's obsession with reading and his desire to become a writer. The passage highlights the impact that this book had on the narrator's life, as he read it repeatedly and became convinced that he wanted to do the same thing as Mr. Dickens. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) depiction of the narrator's father.","Choice $A$ is the best answer. The first paragraph explains the narrator's love of reading: ""Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. ... Where my school friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible pages, I saw light, streets, and people."" The fourth paragraph reiterates this love in its description of the bookshop as a ""sanctuary"" and ""refuge."" The shift in focus occurs in the last six paragraphs, which recount the gift of a book that transforms the narrator's love of reading into a desire to write: ""I did not think there could be a better [book] in the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done."" Thus the passage's overall focus shifts from the narrator's love of reading to a specific incident that influences his decision to become a writer.Choice B is incorrect because the passage never focuses on the narrator's father, who primarily serves to illustrate the narrator's determination to read books despite all obstacles. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because the passage focuses on the narrator's desire to write rather than on whatever skill he may have as a writer. Choice $D$ is incorrect because the passage doesn't make the narrator's childhood hardships its central focus or analyze the effects of those hardships.",B,A,0,1318,989,2307,

","  Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option B: They will be valuable only if they can be harvested cheaply. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the correct answer is option C: They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements.

The passage in Passage 1 highlights the potential value of resources such as water, iron, silicon, and aluminum, which are abundant in the moon's poles and asteroids. These resources are not only valuable for their inherent worth but also for their potential use in space-based projects, such as fueling spacecraft and constructing infrastructure.

In contrast, Passage 2 focuses on the emerging off-world economy and the potential for different types of resources to be valuable in orbit and beyond. The speaker at the space-mining forum in Sydney, Australia, highlights the importance of consensus on the for-profit exploitation of space, suggesting that without it, claims will be disputed, investments will be risky, and gains will be insecure.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: They are likely to be primarily precious metals and rare earth elements. These resources are valuable not only on Earth but also in space, where they can be used for a variety of purposes, including fueling spacecraft and constructing infrastructure.","Choice A is the best answer because both Passage 1 and Passage 2 indicate a belief that the resources most valued in space may differ from those most valued on our planet.

Reflection:

I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting option A, ""Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder."" However, upon further reflection, I realized that the data provided in the table do not necessarily support this claim. While it is true that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, this does not necessarily mean that infection with the pathogen caused the colony collapse disorder.

The table only shows the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen, and does not provide information on the timing of infection or the duration of infection. It is possible that the colonies with colony collapse disorder were already weakened by other factors, such as nutritional deficiencies or exposure to pesticides, and were therefore more susceptible to infection with the pathogens.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, ""Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder."" This answer choice acknowledges that the data do provide evidence that the colonies with colony collapse disorder were more susceptible to infection with the pathogens, but does not necessarily imply that the infection caused the colony collapse disorder.","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is the best answer.

The passage explains that Volkov tested Hodick and Sievers's model by applying an electrical current to the open lobes of the Venus flytrap. However, the passage also states that ""If it took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the total charge, the trap would remain open.""

Answer:
B: Volkov's measurements did not corroborate a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.","Choice B is the best answer. As described in the third paragraph, Hodick and Sievers's model emphasizes that the Venus flytrap closes by means of an electrical charge triggered when the plant's hairs are touched. But as explained in the last paragraph, when Alexander Volkov tested this model, the design of his experiment involved the direct application of an electrical charge, which ""made the trap close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs."" Therefore, Volkov's work could be criticized because his design omitted, rather than corroborated, a central element of Hodick and Sievers's modelnamely, the physical stimulation of the hairs.Choice A is incorrect because although the last paragraph explains that Volkov omitted an element of Hodick and Sievers's model when designing his own experiment, there is no suggestion that he did so out of a faulty understanding of their model.

Context: At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with the driver and we stepped inside Father's shop. It was north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a 5 customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like the scholars of two decades before. The two men were bent over a glass case, discussing the different qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew he did not recognize who we were. So I called his name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle, who apologized many times for not rushing over sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors. She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.

I tried to notice everything so I could later tell GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was during the dustiest part of the summer. And along the walls were display cases made of wood and glass. The glass was very shiny and not one pane was broken. Within those glass cases were our silk-wrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio at Immortal Heart village.

I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes. He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said with graceful importance, ""Your writing will flow as smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake."" He picked up a bird shape: ""Your mind will soar into the clouds of higher thought."" He waved toward a row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies and bamboo: ""Your ledgers will blossom into abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet mind.""

As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into mind. I was remembering how she taught me that everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning: Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work comes without effort. That is the problem of modern ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You simply write what is swimming on the top of your brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his words became far more important than anything Precious Auntie had thought. ""Look here,"" Father said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an inkstick and rotated it in the light. ""See? It's the right hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap brands you might find down the street. And listen to this."" And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a small silver bell. ""The high-pitched tone tells you that the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of old rivers. And the scent-can you smell the balance of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the ink's perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees you using it will know that it was well worth the high price.""

I was very proud to hear Father speak of our family's ink this way.

Since Lincoln associates peace on this issue with geographical limits on the institution of slavery itself, it can be inferred that he would agree that the controversy would abate if all attempts to establish slavery in new regions ceased.Choice A is incorrect because Lincoln neither urges Northern states to attempt to abolish slavery unilaterally nor implies that such an attempt would extinguish the controversy over slavery. Choice $C$ is incorrect because Lincoln neither suggests that the laws regulating slavery are ambiguous nor that such ambiguity exacerbates controversy over slavery. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because Lincoln never attributes the controversy over slavery to differences in religion or social values from one state to another.",,B,0,1389,173,1562,

  A: enables the plant to identify the species of its prey.
  B: conserves the plant's calcium reserves.
  C: safeguards the plant's energy supply.
  D: prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.
","  Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly, selecting choice A, ""enables the plant to identify the species of its prey."" However, upon further reflection, I realize that the passage does not provide any information to suggest that the Venus flytrap can identify the species of its prey based on the number of triggers it receives. The passage only discusses the mechanism by which the plant decides to close its trap based on the number of triggers it receives.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D, ""prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey."" The passage explains that the plant requires multiple triggers to close its trap, which ensures that it captures its prey before closing. This prevents the plant from wasting energy on closing its trap without a sufficient amount of prey to sustain it.

Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. The first paragraph discusses the challenge posed to the Venus flytrap by the opening and closing of its trap: ""Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours, so Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time."" Since closing and reopening the trap requires the expense of precious energy, it can be inferred that by guarding against unnecessary closing, multiple triggers safeguard the plant's energy supply.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the passage never indicates that multiple triggers allow the Venus flytrap to identify which species its prey belongs to, only that they allow it to gauge the prey's size. Choice $B$ is incorrect because although the passage implies that the plant needs to conserve energy and indicates that calcium is involved in the trapclosing mechanism, there is no indication that the plant's calcium reserves themselves require conservation. Choice $D$ is incorrect because it can be inferred from the passage that the advantage of multiple triggers is that they prevent the Venus flytrap from closing on the improper prey rather than from prematurely closing on the proper prey; the passage never implies that when touched by its proper prey, the Venus flytrap is at risk of closing too soon to capture it.",D,C,0,1383,184,1567,

Reflection:
I previously answered the question incorrectly, selecting option B, which is to criticize a tradition. However, upon further reflection, I realize that the main purpose of the first paragraph is to question a suggestion, as indicated in option C. The speaker is expressing surprise and amusement at the young man's bold move and is curious about the possibility of Naomi accepting his proposal. The use of phrases such as ""I think you should go,"" ""How am I involved?"", and ""Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?"" suggest that the speaker is intrigued by the situation and wants to know more. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",C,D,0,1561,151,1712,
