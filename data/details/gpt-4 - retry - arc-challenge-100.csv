Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Choices:
  A: steel cans
  B: glass bottles
  C: paper containers
  D: plastic containers
","Thought: 
All the materials listed can be recycled, but not all can be reused many times. Paper and plastic degrade each time they are recycled, reducing their quality and limiting the number of times they can be reused. Steel cans and glass bottles, on the other hand, can be recycled indefinitely without losing their quality.

Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
Frost forms when water vapor in the air comes into contact with a cold surface and changes directly from a gas (water vapor) to a solid (ice). This process is called deposition, but it's not one of the options. The closest option to deposition is condensation, which is the process where water vapor in the air turns into liquid water.

After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Choices:
  A: Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.
  B: Publish their results in a medical journal.
  C: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.
  D: Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.
","Thought: 
To strengthen their conclusions, the researchers need to conduct more extensive testing. Testing the antibiotic on human volunteers (A) would provide more data on its effectiveness and safety in humans. Having an independent lab retest the antibiotic (C) would provide a second opinion and could help eliminate bias. Testing the antibiotic's effectiveness at killing other bacteria (D) could provide additional information, but it wouldn't necessarily strengthen the conclusions about its effectiveness against pneumonia. Publishing their results in a medical journal (B) would not strengthen their conclusions, but it would disseminate their findings to the scientific community.

Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Choices:
  A: height
  B: hair color
  C: skin color
  D: intelligence
","Thought: 
All the options listed are traits that can be influenced by genetics, hence they are inherited traits. However, they are also significantly influenced by environmental factors. For example, height can be influenced by nutrition, hair color can be changed artificially, skin color can be influenced by sun exposure, and intelligence can be influenced by education and environment. But in the context of the question, all these traits are generally considered inherited.

Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Choices:
  A: perform the investigation in a different way
  B: change the hypothesis to match the results
  C: choose a different investigation
  D: repeat the investigation
","Thought: 
When the results of an investigation do not match the hypothesis, the next step is usually to repeat the investigation to ensure the results were not due to an error. If the results still do not match the hypothesis after repeating the investigation, then it may be necessary to revise the hypothesis. However, without knowing whether the investigation was performed correctly the first time, the best initial step would be to repeat the investigation.
