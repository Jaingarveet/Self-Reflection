Choices:
  A: a definite shape.
  B: a definite volume.
  C: the same number of atoms.
  D: the same amount of energy.
","Choices:
  A: a definite shape.
  B: a definite volume.
  C: the same number of atoms.
  D: the same amount of energy.
","Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly by selecting choice A, which states that both samples have a definite shape. However, this is incorrect because a liquid sample of aluminum does not have a definite shape, but rather takes the shape of its container. 
To correctly answer this question, I need to identify the two samples of aluminum being compared, which are a small, solid sample and a large, liquid sample. I also need to recall the properties of solids and liquids. Solids have a definite shape and volume, while liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. 
Based on this information, I can determine that the small, solid sample of aluminum has a definite shape and volume, while the large, liquid sample of aluminum has a definite volume but takes the shape of its container. Therefore, the property that both samples share is a definite volume.
