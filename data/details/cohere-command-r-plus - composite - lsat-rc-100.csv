  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.

  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
","Thought: The correct answer choice will undermine the connection between increased firm size and monopoly power. 
Choice E suggests that gains from worker specialization, a key advantage of increased firm size, can be offset by factors like higher training costs and employee turnover. This directly challenges the idea that larger firms with specialized workers inherently have a productivity advantage over smaller firms, weakening the link to monopoly power.

  D: The reportorial capability of corridos was probably enhanced by their freedom from the constraints of rhymed ballad forms.
  E: A corrido without a surviving despedida would
","Thought: The correct answer is ""A corrido without a surviving despedida would be nearly impossible for the author to authenticate.""

The passage emphasizes the significance of the 'despedida', a structural element unique to corridos, which signals the conclusion and affirms the authenticity of the ballad. 

Choice A suggests that the reliance on ready-made lines limited the use of metaphors, but the passage does not indicate that this was a hindrance or that it prevented effective metaphor use. 

Choice B is incorrect because, while corridos use local language, the passage does not suggest that this is unique among ballad forms. 

Choice C is incorrect as the passage does not provide a comparison between the imagery in corridos and Spanish ballads. 

Choice D is incorrect because the passage does not discuss rhymed ballad forms or suggest that corridos were free from rhyme constraints. 

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

In Passage B, the plan to selectively cut water to high-income residences is intended to address the issue of overdue water bills. While this plan may have its considerations, compared to turning off the water for all 231,000 households, it carries a lower social cost.

The author of Passage A would likely agree with the statement that acknowledges the lower social cost of the plan in Passage B relative to a more extreme alternative.

","Thought: 
The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" refers to the collaboration between individuals from two different cultures in the creation of autobiographies. In this case, it specifically refers to the process of non-Native American collaborators soliciting, translating, recording, and editing the oral histories of Native Americans. 

Choice A is incorrect because it mentions artifacts and oral traditions, which are not specifically part of the authorship process described. The process focuses on oral communication and cultural collaboration. 

Choice B is incorrect because it suggests that two individuals, each from a different culture, contribute equally to the finished product. While there is collaboration, the process described in the passage involves Native Americans conveying their personal stories, which are then recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators. 

Choice C is incorrect as it introduces the idea of anonymity, which is not relevant to the concept being discussed. The passage emphasizes the cultural collaboration and the role of non-Native American collaborators, not the inability to identify the authors. 

Choice D is a tempting option but falls short of capturing the full essence of the phrase. While it mentions editing and revision, it does not include the critical aspect of oral communication. The passage highlights that the autobiographies emerge from oral histories that are translated and recorded by the non-Native American collaborators. 

Choice E accurately conveys the meaning of ""bicultural composite authorship"" by capturing the collaboration between individuals from different cultures. It specifies that the process involves oral communication by one culture, which is then translated and recorded in written form by an individual from another culture.
