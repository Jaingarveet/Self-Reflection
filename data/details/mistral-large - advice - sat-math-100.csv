Let's denote the original price of the computer as x.
The discounted price is 80% of the original price, which is 0.8x.
The sales tax is 8% of the discounted price, which is 0.08 \* 0.8x = 0.064x.
The total amount Alma paid is the sum of the discounted price and the sales tax, which is 0.8x + 0.064x = 0.864x.
We are given that the total amount Alma paid is p, so we have 0.864x = p.
To find the original price x in terms of p, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.864, which gives us x = p / 0.864.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $D$ is correct. Let $x$ be the original price of the computer, in dollars. The discounted price is 20 percent off the original price, so $x-0.2 x=0.8 x$ is the discounted price, in dollars. The sales tax is 8 percent of the discounted price, so $0.08(0.8 x)$ represents the sales tax Alma paid. The price $p$, in dollars, that Alma paid the cashiers is the sum of the discounted price and the tax: $p=0.8 x+(0.08)(0.8 x)$ which can be rewritten as $p=1.08(0.8 x)$. Therefore, the original price, $x$, of the computer, in dollars, can be written as $\frac{p}{0.8)(1.08)}$ in terms of $p$. Choices A, B, and $C$ are incorrect. The expression in choice $A$ represents $88 \%$ of the amount Alma paid to the cashier, and can be obtained by subtracting the discount of $20 \%$ from the original price and adding the sales tax of $8 \%$.

The expression in choice $B$ is the result of adding the factors associated with the discount and sales tax, 0.8 and .08, rather than multiplying them.

The intersection point $(x, y)$ of the two graphs can be found by multiplying the second equation in the system $1.6 x+0.5 y=-1.3$ by 3 , which gives $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$. The $y$-terms in the equation $4.8 x+1.5 y=-3.9$ and the first equation in the system $2.4 x-1.5 y=0.3$ have coefficients that are opposites.

To find the value of $a$ for which the system has no solution, we need to find the value of $a$ that makes the slopes of the two lines equal, but the lines not the same.
The slope of the first line is $-3$, and the slope of the second line is $-\frac{a}{2}$.
For the slopes to be equal, we need $-3 = -\frac{a}{2}$.
Solving for $a$, we get $a = 6$.
However, we need to check if the lines are the same or not.
If we substitute $a = 6$ into the second equation, we get $6x + 2y = 4$.
This is not the same as the first equation, so the lines are parallel and have no solution.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations are parallel and are not equivalent. Parallel lines have equal slopes but different $y$-intercepts. The slopes and $y$-intercepts for the two given equations can be found by solving each equation for $y$ in terms of $x$, thus putting the equations in slope-intercept form.

To solve this problem, I need to expand the equation $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ and compare it with $15 x^{2}+c x+14$.
Expanding the equation, I get $a b x^{2}+7 a x+2 b x+14$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ on both sides, I get $a b=15$.
Comparing the coefficients of $x$ on both sides, I get $7 a+2 b=c$.
I know that $a+b=8$.
I can solve for $a$ in terms of $b$ or vice versa using this equation.
Let's solve for $a$: $a=8-b$.
Substituting this into the equation $7 a+2 b=c$, I get $7(8-b)+2 b=c$.
Simplifying this equation, I get $c=56-5 b$.
Since $a b=15$, I can substitute $a=8-b$ into this equation to get $(8-b) b=15$.
Expanding this equation, I get $b^{2}-8 b+15=0$.
Factoring this equation, I get $(b-3)(b-5)=0$.
This means that $b$ can be either $3$ or $5$.
If $b=3$, then $a=5$ and $c=56-5 \times 3=31$.
If $b=5$, then $a=3$ and $c=56-5 \times 5=21$.

One can find the possible values of $a$ and $b$ in $(a x+2)(b x+7)$ by using the given equation $a+b=8$ and finding another equation that relates the variables $a$ and $b$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$. Thus, either $a=3$ and $b=5$, or $a=5$ and $b=3$. If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(3 x+2)(5 x+7)=15 x^{2}+31 x+14$. Thus, one of the possible values of $c$ is 31. If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $(a x+2)(b x+7)=(5 x+2)(3 x+7)=15 x^{2}+41 x+14$. Thus, another possible value for $c$ is 41 .

Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches.

The equation should represent the remaining balance after the initial payment, which is $240, and the weekly payments of $30 multiplied by the number of weeks, w.
The correct equation is $240 = 30w.

I need to adjust the equation to match one of the available choices.
The initial payment of $60 was subtracted from the total price, so I need to subtract $60 from both sides of the equation to get $300 = 30w + 60.
