","Self-reflection:
The symptoms of right-sided nasal obstruction and discharge, which is sometimes blood-tinged, along with the biopsy findings, suggest a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. This is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the respiratory tract and kidneys. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that can damage tissues and organs. The biopsy findings show necrotizing granulomas, which are a hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis. Rhinoscleroma is a chronic bacterial infection that can cause nasal obstruction and discharge, but it is not associated with necrotizing granulomas. Stewa's granuloma is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it is not associated with systemic symptoms like those seen in this patient. Rhinosporidiosis is a fungal infection that can cause nasal obstruction and discharge, but it is more common in tropical regions and is not associated with necrotizing granulomas.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care.

","Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph
  B: High concentration
  C: Weak acid and weak base combination
  D: easy to measure
","Reflection:
I previously answered this question incorrectly. I now understand that bicarbonate buffer systems are important in blood because they help maintain the pH of blood within a narrow range. Bicarbonate buffer systems are ideal in blood because they are a combination of a weak acid (carbonic acid) and its conjugate base (bicarbonate ion), which means they can act as both an acid and a base. This allows them to effectively buffer changes in pH by either accepting or donating protons. The pKa of bicarbonate buffer systems is also close to the pH of blood, which means they are most effective at buffering changes in pH within this range. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Pka is equal to Ph.
Action: Answer(""A"")","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U.

  C: Increased TIBC, increased serum ferritin, Transferrin ferritin index >1
  D: Increased TIBC, decreased serum ferritin, Transferrin ferritin index >1
","Action: Answer(""D"") 
Explanation:
1. The laboratory tests used to diagnose iron deficiency anemia are serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).
2. TIBC is a measure of the amount of iron that can be bound by transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood. When iron stores are low, the body produces more transferrin to try to increase iron uptake, leading to an increase in TIBC. Serum ferritin is a measure of the amount of iron stored in the body. When iron stores are low, serum ferritin levels decrease.
3. The laboratory findings that are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia are decreased serum ferritin and increased TIBC.
4. Answer choice A includes increased TIBC, decreased serum ferritin, and a transferrin ferritin index > 2. The transferrin ferritin index is calculated by dividing the TIBC by the serum ferritin. A value greater than 2 suggests iron deficiency, but this finding is not specific to iron deficiency anemia. Answer choice B includes decreased TIBC, decreased serum ferritin, and a transferrin ferritin index <1. This combination of findings is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Answer choice C includes increased TIBC and increased serum ferritin, which is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Answer choice D includes the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia: increased TIBC and decreased serum ferritin. The transferrin ferritin index is not necessary to diagnose iron deficiency anemia, but it is typically <1 in this condition.
5. Answer choice D includes the laboratory findings that are diagnostic of iron deficiency anemia.
6. Double-checking the answer confirms that it matches the diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anemia.","Iron deficiency anaemia
