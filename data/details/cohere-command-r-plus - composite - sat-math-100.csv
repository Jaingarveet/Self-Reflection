The table shows a clear pattern: as $x$ increases by $3a$, $y$ decreases by $a$. This indicates a linear relationship with a slope of $-\frac{1}{3}$. The y-intercept is at $(0,0)$, as when $x=a$, $y=0$. 

The equation for this line is $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + b$, where $b$ is the y-intercept, $0$ in this case. So, the equation becomes $y = -\frac{1}{3}x$. 

Rearranging to make $x$ the subject, we get: 

$x = -3y$. 

Multiplying by $a$ gives: 

$x + 2y = a$. 

So, the correct answer is $A: x + 2y = a$.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is correct. The slope-intercept form of a linear equation in the $x y$-plane is $y=m x+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation and $b$ is the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept of the graph. Any two ordered pairs $\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\right)$ that satisfy a linear equation can be used to compute the slope of the graph of the equation using the formula $m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}$. Substituting the two pairs $(a, 0)$ and $(3 a,-a)$ from the table into the formula gives $m=\frac{-a-0}{3 a-a}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{-a}{2 a}$, or $-\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this value for $m$ in the slope-intercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+b$. Substituting values from the ordered pair $(a, 0)$ in the table into this equation produces $0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$, which simplifies to $b=\frac{a}{2}$. Substituting this value for $b$ in the slopeintercept form of the equation produces $y=-\frac{1}{2} x+\frac{a}{2}$. Rewriting this equation in standard form by adding $\frac{1}{2} x$ to both sides and then multiplying both sides by 2 gives the equation $x+2 y=a$.Choice B is incorrect and may result from a calculation error when determining the $y$-intercept of the graph of the equation.

The equations are:
$y = x^2$
$2y + 6 = 2x + 12$

Solving for $y$ in the first equation:
$y = x^2$

Substituting $y$ into the second equation:
$2x^2 + 6 = 2x + 12$

Simplifying and rearranging:
$2x^2 - 2x - 6 = 0$

Using the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6)}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm 4\sqrt{5}}{4}$

For $x > 0$, take the positive root:
$x = \frac{2 + 4\sqrt{5}}{4} = 1 + \sqrt{5}$

Substituting $x$ back into $y = x^2$:
$y = (1 + \sqrt{5})^2 = (1 + \sqrt{5}) \cdot (1 + \sqrt{5}) = 6 + 2\sqrt{5}$

Calculating $xy$:
$xy = (1 + \sqrt{5})(6 + 2\sqrt{5}) = 6 + 12\sqrt{5} + 5 + 10\sqrt{5} = 11 + 22\sqrt{5}$

Subtracting $4 x$ from both sides of $4 x=x^{2}-3 x-3 x+9$ yields $0=x^{2}-3 x-3 x-4 x+9$, which can be rewritten as $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$. Factoring the right-hand side of $0=x^{2}-10 x+9$ gives $0=(x-1)(x-9)$. By the zero product property, if $0=(x-1)(x-9)$, then $0=x-1$ or $0=x-9$. Adding 1 to both sides of $0=x-1$ gives $x=1$.

Since $a b$ is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the left side of the equation and 15 is the coefficient of $x^{2}$ on the right side of the equation, it must be true that $a b=15$. Since $a+b=8$, it follows that $b=8-a$. Thus, $a b=15$ can be rewritten as $a 8-a)=15$, which in turn can be rewritten as $a^{2}-8 a+15=0$. Factoring gives $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.

The range of the lengths of the 21 fish represented in the table is $24-8=16$ inches, and the range of the remaining 20 lengths after the 24 -inch measurement is removed is $16-8=8$ inches. Therefore, after the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the change in range, 8 inches, is much greater than the change in the mean or median.Choice A is incorrect. Let $m$ be the mean of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish. Then the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the 21 fish is $21 \mathrm{~m}$. After the 24 -inch measurement is removed, the sum of the lengths, in inches, of the remaining 20 fish is $21 m-24$, and the mean length, in inches, of these 20 fish is $\frac{21 m-24}{20}$, which is a change of $\frac{24-m}{20}$ inches. Since $m$ must be between the smallest and largest measurements of the 21 fish, it follows that $8<m<24$, from which it can be seen that the change in the mean, in inches, is between $\frac{24-24}{20}=0$ and $\frac{24-8}{20}=\frac{4}{5}$, and so must be less than the change in the range, 8 inches.

\frac{24x^2 + 25x + 421}{ax - 2} &= \frac{-521}{ax - 2}
\end{align*}

Setting the numerators and denominators equal, we get:

\begin{align*}
24x^2 + 25x + 421 &= -521 \\
ax - 2 &= ax - 2
\end{align*}

The second equation is satisfied for all values of $a$. For the first equation, we can rearrange and solve for $x$:

\begin{align*}
24x^2 + 25x + 446 &= 0 \\
24x^2 + 64x - 9x + 446 &= 0 \\
3(8x^2 + 16x) - 9(8x + 52) &= 0 \\
3(4x + 4)^2 - 9(4x + 13) &= 0 \\
3(4x + 4 + 3)(4x + 4 - 3) &= 0 \\
3(4x + 7)(4x + 1) &= 0
\end{align*}

So, the solutions for $x$ are $x = -\frac{7}{4}$ and $x = -\frac{1}{4}$. Now, we can find the value of $a$ by substituting these values back into the original equation:

For $x = -\frac{7}{4}$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{24(-\frac{7}{4})^2 + 25(-\frac{7}{4}) - 47}{a(-\frac{7}{4}) - 2} &= -8(-\frac{7}{4}) - 3 - \frac{53}{a(-\frac{7}{4}) - 2} \\
\frac{-147 + 175 - 47}{a(-\frac{7}{4}) - 2} &= \frac{56 - 12 - 53}{a(-\frac{7}{4}) - 2} \\
\frac{178}{\frac{-7a}{4} - 2} &= \frac{-14}{\frac{-7a}{4} - 2}
\end{align*}

Multiplying by the reciprocal and simplifying:

\begin{align*}
(\frac{-7a}{4} - 2)(178) &= (\frac{-7a}{4} - 2)(-14) \\
-7a - 8 &= -14 \\
-7a &= 6 \\
a &= -\frac{6}{-7} \\
a &= \boxed{3}
\end{align*}

For $x = -\frac{1}{4}$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{24(-\frac{1}{4})^2 + 25(-\frac{1}{4}) - 47}{a(-\frac{1}{4}) - 2} &= -8(-\frac{1}{4}) - 3 - \frac{53}{a(-\frac{1}{4}) - 2} \\
\frac{-6 + 25 - 47}{a(-\frac{1}{4}) - 2} &= \frac{2 - 12 - 53}{a(-\frac{1}{4}) - 2} \\
\frac{-28}{\frac{-a}{4} - 2} &= \frac{-63}{\frac{-a}{4} - 2}
\end{align*}

Multiplying by the reciprocal and simplifying:

\begin{align*}
(\frac{-a}{4} - 2)(-28) &= (\frac{-a}{4} - 2)(-63) \\
-a - 8 &= -63 \\
-a &= 55 \\
a &= -55
\end{align*}

In the second scenario, each student receives 4 milliliters, so he needs $4x$ milliliters in total. He currently has $n$ milliliters, so he requires an additional $4x - n = 21$ milliliters.

To find the number of weekly payments, we need to consider the total cost of the television, the initial payment, and the weekly payment amount. 

The equation representing this situation is: 
Total cost = Initial payment + (Weekly payment x Number of weekly payments) 

Plugging in the values, we get: 
$300 = 60 + 30w$ 

Now, we can isolate $w$ to find the number of weekly payments: 
$240 = 30w$ 
$w = 8$

","Thought: 
Alan wants to save $5, and gasoline costs $4 per gallon, so he needs to determine how many fewer miles he should drive to achieve this saving. 

First, calculate the number of gallons $5$ savings will get him: 
$\$5 \text{ savings} \times \frac{\$4}{\text{gallon}} = 1.25 \text{ gallons}$

Now, find out how many miles $1.25$ gallons will give him: 
$1.25 \text{ gallons} \times \frac{25 \text{ miles}}{\text{gallon}} = 31.25 \text{ miles}$

So, to save $5, he needs to reduce his weekly driving by 31.25 miles. 

The equation to represent this is $\frac{25}{4}m = 31.25$, where $m$ is the number of fewer miles. Simplifying, 
$\frac{25}{4}m = \frac{5}{4} \times 12.5 = 5$.

$\frac{(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5)}{(2x+5)^2}$.

Simplifying the numerator, we get:
$(x+2)(x+3)(2x+5) = 2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30$.

Simplifying the denominator, we get:
$(2x+5)^2 = 4x^2 + 20x + 25$.

So, the fraction simplifies to:
$\frac{2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30}{4x^2 + 20x + 25}$.

To match the denominator with one of the choices, we need to multiply the expression by $\frac{x^2+5x+6}{x^2+5x+6}$. Multiplying the numerator and denominator by this expression, we get:
$\frac{(2x^3 + 13x^2 + 26x + 30)(x^2+5x+6)}{(4x^2 + 20x + 25)(x^2+5x+6)}$.

","Thought: 
To estimate the proportion of all employees who are satisfied, it is important to ensure that the sample represents all 50 stores. This is because job satisfaction may vary across different stores. 

Selecting a one store at random and surveying all its employees could result in a biased estimate as it may not represent the other 49 stores. Surveying only high- or low-paid employees introduces a salary bias, and creating a website may result in a self-selection bias.

Therefore, the best method is to select a random sample of employees from each store. This ensures that every store is represented and provides a more accurate estimate of the proportion of satisfied employees across the entire company.

Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice $\mathbf{B}$ is correct. Selecting employees from each store at random is most appropriate because it's most likely to ensure that the group surveyed will accurately represent each store location and all employees.Choice A is incorrect. Surveying employees at a single store location will only provide an accurate representation of employees at that location, not at all 50 store locations. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect. Surveying the highest- and lowest-paid employees will not give an accurate representation of employees across all pay grades at the company. Choice D is incorrect. Collecting only the first 50 responses mimics the results of a self-selected survey. For example, the first 50 employees to respond to the survey could be motivated by an overwhelming positive or negative experience and thus will not accurately represent all employees.",B,B,1,820,151,971,

After approximately how many seconds will the ball hit the ground?

  A: 3.5

  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0

  A: 3.5
  B: 4.0
  C: 4.5
  D: 5.0
","Thought: 
The ball is launched upward with an initial velocity of 25 m/s, so we are looking for the positive root of the quadratic equation.

Setting $h = 0$, we get $0 = -4.9t^2 + 25t$.

Using the quadratic formula, $t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, we find:
$t = \frac{-25 \pm \sqrt{25^2 - 4 \cdot (-4.9) \cdot 0}}{2 \cdot -4.9} = \frac{-25 \pm 25}{2 \cdot -4.9} \approx 5.1$ seconds.

Thus, the ball hits the ground after approximately $5$ seconds, which is closest to choice D.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice $\mathbf{D}$ is correct. When the ball hits the ground, its height is 0 meters. Substituting 0 for $h$ in $h=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$ gives $0=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$, which can be rewritten as $0=t(-4.9 t+25)$. Thus, the possible values of $t$ are $t=0$ and $t=\frac{25}{4.9} \approx 5.1$. The time $t=0$ seconds corresponds to the time the ball is launched from the ground, and the time $t \approx 5.1$ seconds corresponds to the time after launch that the ball hits the ground. Of the given choices, 5.0 seconds is closest to 5.1 seconds, so the ball returns to the ground approximately 5.0 seconds after it is launched.Choice A, B, and C are incorrect and could arise from conceptual or computation errors while solving $0=-4.9 t^{2}+25 t$ for $t$.",D,D,1,871,201,1072,

","Thought: 
The slope-intercept form of a linear function is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

First, calculate the slope ($m$) using any two points from the table:
$\frac{f(2)-f(1)}{2-1}=\frac{1+2}{-2+1}=\frac{3}{-1}=-3$

So, the slope $m=-3$.

Next, find the y-intercept ($b$) by evaluating $f(0)$ from the table:
$b=f(0)=-2$

Now, we can write the equation of the linear function:
$f(n)=-3n-2$

Comparing this equation with the choices:
Choice A: $f(n)=n-3$, is not in the form of a linear function with the correct slope and y-intercept.
Choice B: $f(n)=2n-4$, does not have the correct slope or y-intercept.
Choice C: $f(n)=3n-5$, has the correct y-intercept ($f(0)=-2$) but does not have the correct slope.
Choice D: $f(n)=4n-6$, does not have the correct slope or y-intercept.

Therefore, the correct answer is Choice A: $f(n)=n-3$.

Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. The graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line that passes through each of the points given in the table. From the table, one can see that an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$; for example, $f 2)-f(1)=1-(-2)=3$. Therefore, the graph of $y=f(n)$ in the coordinate plane is a line with slope 3. Only choice $\mathrm{C}$ is a line with slope 3. The $y$-intercept of the line is the value of $f(0)$. Since an increase of 1 unit in $n$ results in an increase of 3 units in $f(n)$, it follows that $f 1)-f(0)=3$. Since $f(1)=-2$, it follows that $f(0)=f(1)-3=-5$. Therefore, the $y$-intercept of the graph of $f(n)$ is -5 , and the equation in slope-intercept form that defined $f$ is $f(n)=3 n-5$.Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each equation has the incorrect slope of the line (the $y$-intercept in each equation is also incorrect).",A,C,0,832,323,1155,

","Thought: 
Let $L$ be the length and $W$ be the width of the rectangle.
The original area of the rectangle is $LW$.
After altering the rectangle, the new length is $1.1L$, and the new width is $(1 - p/100)W$.
So, the new area of the rectangle, $A'$, can be calculated as:
$$A' = (1.1L)(1 - p/100)W$$

We know that these alterations resulted in a 12% decrease in the area, so we can set up the equation:
$$0.88LW = (1.1)(1 - p/100)LW$$

Simplifying the equation:
$$0.88 = 1.1(1 - p/100)$$
$$0.8 = 1 - p/100$$
$$-0.2 = -p/100$$
$$p = 20$$

So, the value of $p$ is 20.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is correct. Let $\ell$ and $w$ be the length and width, respectively, of the original rectangle. The area of the original rectangle is $A=\ell w$. The rectangle is altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent; thus, the length of the altered rectangle is $1.1 \ell$, and the width of the altered rectangle is $\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. The alterations decrease the area by 12 percent, so the area of the altered rectangle is $(1-0.12) A=0.88 A$. The area of the altered rectangle is the product of its length and width, so $0.88 A=(1.1 \ell)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) w$. Since $A=\ell w$, this last equation can be rewritten as $0.88 A=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) \ell w=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right) A$, from which it follows that $0.88=(1.1)\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$, or $0.8=\left(1-\frac{p}{100}\right)$. Therefore, $\frac{p}{100}=0.2$, and so the value of $p$ is 20 .Choice $A$ is incorrect and may be the result of confusing the 12 percent decrease in area with the percent decrease in width. Choice $B$ is incorrect because decreasing the width by 15 percent results in a 6.5 percent decrease in area, not a 12 percent decrease.

First, I'll multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 4 to clear the fractions:
$\begin{array}{r}
6x + 8y = -46 \\
8y - 4x = -76 \\

Now, adding the two equations eliminates $y$:
$6x + 8y - 4x = -46 - 76$
$2x + 8y = -122$

Dividing by 2, we get:
$x + 4y = -61$

Substituting $x + 4y = -61$ back into the original equation, we can solve for $x$ and $y$:
$3x + 4y = -23$
$3x + 4y + x = -23 + x$
$4x + 4y = -23 + x$

Combining like terms:
$4x + 4y = x - 23$
