  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture

  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step based on the critics' perspective described in the third paragraph:
1. The critics argue that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture being studied. They object to using Western scientific methods to study nonscientific cultures.
2. More broadly, these critics would likely object to any study that uses the theories, methods, or values of one culture to examine or criticize another culture with different values. 
3. Looking at each choice:
A) Comparing moral codes of different societies doesn't necessarily involve judging one by the other's standards. The critics might not object to this.
B) Using a culture's own literature to understand what characteristics it admires aligns with the critics' view that a culture should be understood on its own terms. They likely wouldn't object.
C) Using Western scientific methods to study a nonscientific culture is problematic for the critics. However, this isn't the most complete answer, as it only captures one aspect of their perspective.
D) Using one society's literary theories to criticize another society's literature directly involves judging one culture by another's standards and values. This is precisely the kind of approach the critics would object to, as it fails to understand the other culture on its own terms.
E) Using Western methods to criticize Western culture itself is not the main issue the critics are concerned about. Their focus is on how nonscientific, non-Western cultures are studied and judged.
4. Choice D most completely captures what the critics in the third paragraph would find objectionable - using the standards and theories of one culture to criticize another. It involves the imposition of foreign values that the critics oppose.

","You're right, upon re-reading the passage carefully, it's clear that while three positions are introduced, Dostoyevsky's third position is differentiated primarily from the second, radical position in detail. The first position is only mentioned briefly without much elaboration.
The passage spends several paragraphs explaining how Dostoyevsky's view differs from the radical critics' perspective on the purpose and nature of art and literature. In contrast, the first position that art should stand above everyday reality is not analyzed in depth.
So the key structural point is that the passage presents Dostoyevsky's position as a contrast to the radical view, going into detail on how his understanding of the role of art and literature diverges from their utilitarian perspective. The first position serves more as brief context rather than a major point of comparison.

Choice A supports rather than questions the assertion by stating Morrison intentionally simulated jazz style in the narration. Eliminate A.
Choice B about earlier writers using blues structure would directly contradict the assertion that Morrison was the first to do this with jazz. However, the question asks what would call the assertion into question, not definitively disprove it. Eliminate B.
Choice C is overly broad, referring to all novels about nonliterary arts, not the specific assertion about Morrison's use of musical structure. Eliminate C. 
Choice D suggests any novel can be considered somewhat musical, especially if read aloud. This subtly calls into question whether Morrison's use of jazz structure was truly groundbreaking, since it implies musicality may be inherent to novels in general. Keep D.
Choice E is not directly relevant to the assertion about Morrison's structural innovation. The relative number of African American authors writing about music doesn't impact whether her use of jazz structure was a first. Eliminate E.
By process of elimination, D is the best answer. While it doesn't definitively disprove that Morrison was the first to use musical structure, it invites doubt by suggesting musical qualities may be universal to novels to some degree.

  D: Fingerprint identification should not be considered to have a low error rate Wlless rigorously conducted tests have shown this to be so.
  E: Fingerprint examiners must follow objective standards iffingerprint identification is to be reliable.
","Thought process:
Both passages discuss the lack of uniform, objective standards in fingerprint examination and identification. This is the key principle underlying their arguments:
Passage A acknowledges there is no generally accepted standard for the number of matching points required to declare a fingerprint match. However, it argues this is outweighed by the long history and general acceptance of fingerprint evidence.
Passage B emphasizes that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for declaring a match, with practices varying between jurisdictions. It argues this lack of standards undermines the reliability of fingerprint evidence. 
While the passages reach different conclusions, they share the premise that objective standards are important for assessing the reliability of fingerprint examination. Passage A believes the lack of fully uniform standards is not disqualifying, while Passage B sees it as a critical flaw. But both agree that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be considered reliable.
Looking at the answer choices:
A is incorrect - this captures Passage A's argument but not the common principle.
B is incorrect - this is closer but still focuses more on Passage B's conclusion. 
C is incorrect - while both passages discuss this, it is a detail, not the key principle.
D is incorrect - this relates to a detail in Passage B but not the overarching theme.
E correctly identifies the core premise that objective standards are necessary for fingerprint evidence to be reliable, which underlies the arguments in both passages.

D) The passage does not compare the ease of splitting different types of atoms.
E) The passage explicitly states: ""These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials...""

","You're right, I need to focus more carefully on the author's central argument about what will drive the transition to the digital publishing model.
The key points are:
1) Under digital publishing, many traditional costs are eliminated, so authors would be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. 
2) Literary agents could thus be expected to demand significantly higher royalties for authors than has been traditional.
3) To accommodate these higher royalty demands, traditional publishers will have to reduce redundant functions or else lose authors to digital-only publishers. 
4) This pressure from literary agents for higher royalties is described as the driving force that will push traditional publishers to adapt to the digital model.
So the author's main argument is that the demands of literary agents for higher author royalties, enabled by the cost efficiencies of digital publishing, will be the primary impetus for the publishing industry's transition to the digital model. The other factors mentioned, while advantages of digital publishing, are not identified as the main drivers of this change.

","Thought process:
Passage A focuses specifically on a defendant's appeal challenging the fingerprint evidence used in his criminal trial. It discusses the defendant's specific claims about the lack of testing, error rates, and uniform standards. The passage then explains the court's reasoning for rejecting the defendant's challenge in this particular case, citing the long history and expert consensus on the reliability of fingerprint evidence. The scope is limited to the handling of fingerprint evidence in this specific appeal.
In contrast, Passage B takes a broader look at the issues with fingerprint examination as a whole. It points out the general lack of objective standards for declaring fingerprint matches, the unknown probabilities of different individuals sharing identifying characteristics, and the dearth of systematic study on error rates in the field. The passage highlights issues that apply to fingerprint examination in general, not just a specific case.
Compared to Passage A, Passage B is more general in its focus on the overarching problems in the field of fingerprint examination. While Passage A is limited to one court case, Passage B discusses the implications for fingerprint evidence more broadly.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The question asks what is most strongly implied by the passage. This means I need to look for a key idea that the passage suggests or supports throughout, even if not stated directly.
2. The first two sentences provide a crucial definition: ""The term 'proverb' refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom.""
3. Later, the passage states: ""Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs.""
4. Looking at the answer choices:
A, B, C and E focus on specific uses or functions of proverbs within Mexican American communities. While the passage does discuss these, they are supporting details rather than the main implication.
D directly restates the two key definitional points about proverbs: that they can be understood without specific context, but their meaning in each use depends on the social context. This seems to be a fundamental implication about the nature of proverbs.
5. Therefore, choice D is the best answer. It captures the core idea about what proverbs are and how they function, which underpins the rest of the passage's discussion.

Lines 7-11: ""Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation.""
This sentence reports the view of some legal scholars that lawyers should always provide the best possible defense for their clients, regardless of the lawyer's own opinion about the client's guilt or innocence.
Lines 28-31: ""In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent.""
Here, the author expresses their own opinion that lawyers should only try to prove a client's innocence if the lawyer sincerely believes the client may be innocent. This implies the author believes lawyers should not attempt to prove innocence if they believe the client is guilty.
The author's opinion in lines 28-31 clearly disagrees with the view reported in lines 7-11. The legal scholars argue lawyers should always provide the best defense regardless of personal judgments, while the author argues a lawyer's actions should depend on their sincere belief about the client's innocence.

","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. The passage discusses the contradiction between the Invisible Hand (which assumes diminishing returns and perfect competition) and the Pin Factory (which involves increasing returns and a tendency towards monopoly). 
2. Economists historically focused more on the Invisible Hand concept because diminishing returns were easier to model mathematically than increasing returns.
3. The railroad industry is mentioned as an example of an industry characterized by increasing returns, which aligns with the Pin Factory concept. 
4. By providing the railroad example, the author is illustrating that many real-world industries exhibit increasing returns, contradicting the assumptions of the Invisible Hand.
5. Therefore, the emphasis on the Invisible Hand in economic thought has shortcomings, as it fails to account for industries like railroads that have increasing returns.
Looking at the answer choices:
A and B are incorrect because the railroad example is not used to resolve ambiguity in the Invisible Hand metaphor or illustrate the difficulty of mathematically modeling the Pin Factory.
C is the best answer. The railroad industry is used as an example to highlight that increasing returns (the Pin Factory concept) are prevalent in many industries, contrary to the Invisible Hand assumptions.

The key criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures is distorting and an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism. The critics argue that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the internal perspectives and methods of the cultures being studied.
Looking at each answer choice:
A) If it's impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture, then the critics' proposed solution of studying cultures using their own internal methods would not be feasible. This directly challenges the criticism.
B) The similarity of value systems between many non-Western societies is not directly relevant to the specific criticism being made. It doesn't address the issue of using Western methods vs. internal cultural perspectives.
C) The fact that some non-Western societies use their own value systems to study other cultures doesn't directly address the criticism that Western societies using Western methods prevents genuine understanding. It's a tangential point.
D) This is about understanding one's own culture through scientific investigation, which is not the issue being discussed in the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
E) While this states that genuine understanding is necessary for appreciation, it doesn't challenge the criticism that using Western methods prevents such genuine understanding. It actually seems to align with the critics' perspective.
