Choice B captures the core message of the text by emphasizing the importance of feeling and accepting the difficult emotions associated with a breakup. It conveys that experiencing heartache and understanding the pain can contribute to personal growth and strength.

Choice C suggests deep breathing as a way to process grief, which is a distraction technique and does not involve actively engaging with one's emotions.

In addition to increased libido, testosterone supplements can help you avoid unwanted erections and maintain erections when aroused.

","Thought: 
The text discusses how taking testosterone supplements can improve sexual function in individuals with a low sex drive, particularly focusing on the potential benefits for older individuals. 

Choice A introduces the idea of testosterone supplements helping to maintain erections, which is mentioned in the original text, but it also includes a confusing and incorrect statement about women and erections, which does not align with the topic. 

Choice B is the correct answer as it provides a logical continuation of the topic by discussing the potential downside of taking testosterone supplements, which is a reduction in sex drive if one already has a healthy level of testosterone. 

Choice C introduces the idea of distinguishing between testosterone and 'regular' erections, but the statement about women with low testosterone and their sexual function is unclear and doesn't seem logically related to the original text. 

Choice D shifts the focus to physical changes in men with low testosterone, which is a separate topic from the original text's focus on sexual function and libido.

The text is structured as a guide, with a clear header, title, and steps, offering a method to obtain free minutes on prepaid phones. The correct answer should align with this structure and provide practical advice to achieve the stated goal.

Choice A is incorrect as it mentions promo codes but lacks context and a clear relationship to the guide's topic.

Choice B is incorrect as it refers to finding and using codes but does not fit the guide format. The advice about asking the customer for help is unclear and unrelated to the specific topic of obtaining free minutes.

Choice C provides a practical suggestion to search online for promo codes specific to one's prepaid phone service provider. This advice directly relates to the guide's topic and offers a clear path to obtaining free minutes.

Choice D is illogical and irrelevant. Creating promotion codes by the customer is not a feasible option, and turning off one's phone to devote time to this task does not make sense in this context.
