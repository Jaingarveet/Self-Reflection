","Thought: 
Given that T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, it means that T is performed immediately before F. This satisfies the first condition. 
Since T is performed fifth and F is performed sixth, there are four compositions before T and F, and two compositions after them. This satisfies the second condition. 
O cannot be performed fifth because T is performed fifth, so O must be performed first. This satisfies the third condition. 
The eighth composition can be either L or H, this doesn't affect S's position. 
P is performed at some time before S, so S cannot be performed first, second, or third because P must be performed before it and O is already performed first. 
At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since O is performed first, there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. So, S cannot be performed second.

Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. This does not mean Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. It only means she reviews more plays. So, options C, D, and E are possible.

Given the conditions, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, and that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. This means that there must be at least one day where two batches of cookies are made. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie can be made on the same day, this means that there must be at least one day before Thursday where two batches of cookies are made. Therefore, it is not possible for only one batch of cookies to be made on Friday.

","Thought: 
Given the conditions, Image's voicemail target must be the shortest, so it must be 1 day. This means that Image's website target can be either 1 or 2 days. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so if Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, then Solide's website target can be 1 or 2 days. This means that Truvest's website target can be either 2 or 3 days. Truvest's voicemail target can be either 2 or 3 days, but it must be shorter than its website target, so it can only be 2 days if the website target is 3 days. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target could be 2 days.

Given the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. This means Jiang must review Undulation and/or Sunset. Since exactly three students review Undulation, and we know that Megregian reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez, it's possible that Megregian reviews all three plays, including Undulation. However, the conditions do not specify that Megregian must review Undulation. Therefore, it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset.
