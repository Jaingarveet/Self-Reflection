","Choices:
  A: $\mathrm{IAPV}$
  B: $\mathrm{KBV}$
  C: Nosema apis
  D: Nosema ceranae
","You're right, I made a mistake in my previous answer. Let me take another careful look at the question and data to determine the correct answer.
The question asks which of the four pathogens infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder. 
Looking at the data for ""Colonies without colony collapse disorder (%)"" in the table:
IAPV: 76%
KBV: 48% 
Nosema apis: 81%
Nosema ceranae: 0%
The highest percentage is 81% for Nosema apis. 
So the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of colonies without colony collapse disorder is Nosema apis.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice D is the best answer. The table shows that 81 percent of colonies without colony collapse disorder were affected by the pathogen Nosema ceranae.Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not identify the pathogen that infected the highest percentage of honeybee colonies without colony collapse disorder as based on data in the table.",C,D,0,1435,161,1596,

","Choices:
  A: 0 percent
  B: 77 percent
  C: 83 percent
  D: 100 percent
","You're right, I made a mistake in my previous answer. Let me take another look at the data and think through this step-by-step:
The question is asking what percent of colonies with colony collapse disorder had bees infected by all four pathogens listed.
Looking at the data:
- 83% of CCD colonies had IAPV 
- 100% had KBV
- 90% had Nosema apis
- 77% had Nosema ceranae
However, the key is the last row which explicitly states the percentage that had all four pathogens together. For the CCD colonies, that value is 77%.
So synthesizing the data, while high percentages had each individual pathogen, 77% had the combination of all four.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer(""B"")","Choice B is the best answer. The table shows that 77 percent of the honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder were infected by all four pathogens.Choices $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{C}$, and $\mathrm{D}$ are incorrect because they do not identify the percent of honeybee colonies with colony collapse disorder that were infected by all four pathogens as based on data in the table.",B,B,1,1416,188,1604,

Choices:
  A: They included no means for reconciling differences between free states and slave states.

  B: They anticipated the Union's expansion into western territories.
  C: They provided a good basic structure that does not need to be changed.
  D: They were founded on an assumption that slavery was necessary for economic growth.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The key points from Passage 1 are:
- The Constitution allowed for a Union divided into Free and Slave states from the beginning
- Under this divided Union, the country has grown tremendously in population, territory, wealth and power
- The speaker believes the Union can continue to exist forever divided into Free and Slave states, as long as each state is allowed to regulate its own affairs 
- As the nation grows and expands into new territory, slavery can also expand under the principle of states' rights
So in essence, Passage 1 argues that the Constitution's allowance for Free and Slave states provides a good framework that has enabled the nation's growth so far and can continue to do so as the nation expands westward. The speaker believes no changes are needed to this basic structure.
Looking at the choices:
A) is incorrect - the passage suggests the Constitution does provide a way for Free and Slave states to coexist in the Union
B) is supported - the passage explicitly discusses expansion into new western territories 
C) aligns with the main point - the Constitution provides a good structure that can persist unchanged
D) is not supported - the passage does not link slavery to economic necessity
Therefore, the best answers are B and C. Since I can only choose one, I'll go with C as it captures the central argument of the passage.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Choice $\mathbf{C}$ is the best answer. In the second paragraph of Passage 1 , Douglas uses a rhetorical question to stress that the division into slave and free states has existed since the beginning of the United States: ""I now come back to the question, why cannot this Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, as our fathers made it?"" It can be inferred from this question that Douglas believes that since this division is long-standing, the provisions for it in the US Constitution have provided a good basic structure that doesn't need to be changed.Choice A is incorrect because in Passage 1, Douglas doesn't observe that the US Constitution's provisions for slavery lack a means for reconciling differences between slave states and free states. Choice B is incorrect because although Douglas stresses that the provisions for slavery are long-standing, he doesn't characterize them as having somehow anticipated the Union's expansion to the west. Choice D is correct because although it can be inferred from Passage 1 that Douglas believes the provisions for slavery have had a positive economic impact, he nowhere implies that the founders based them on an assumption that slavery was economically necessary.",C,C,1,1349,313,1662,

","Choices:
  A: She will consider his proposal inappropriate.
  B: She will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
  C: She will consider his unscheduled visit an imposition.
  D: She will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions
","Thought process:
Akira seems most concerned that Chie will view his untraditional, direct proposal as inappropriate. A few key details support this:
1) The passage states ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal."" This directly indicates Akira is worried Chie will consider the proposal inappropriate or ""unseemly"".
2) Akira acknowledges he is breaking tradition and not following proper protocol by coming directly to Chie, rather than going through a go-between. He knows this is unconventional.
3) He tries to justify his direct approach by saying the proper method ""takes much time"" and he has an urgent opportunity in America. This shows he feels the need to explain his inappropriate forwardness.
4) The overall tone when describing Akira's arrival and speech conveys a sense of nervousness and fear of disapproval from Chie.
While Chie does react with ""maternal amusement"" and thinks of him as a child, which could suggest she mistakes his earnestness for immaturity, this seems more her perspective than Akira's primary fear. The passage emphasizes more strongly Akira's concern that his breaking of tradition will be judged as improper and harm his chances. The other choices are less supported by the text.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Akira is very concerned Chie will find his marriage proposal inappropriate because he did not follow traditional protocol and use a ""go-between"" (line 65). This is clear in lines 63-64, when Akira says to Chie ""Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal.""Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity. Choice $\mathrm{C}$ is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice $\mathrm{D}$ is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.",A,A,1,1594,296,1890,

","Choices:
  A: reserved around unfamiliar people.
  B: attuned to her immediate surroundings.
  C: sympathetic to the needs of others.
  D: anxious about her responsibilities.
","You're right, upon further reflection the passage most strongly portrays the narrator as reserved around unfamiliar people:
- She speaks in a ""shy voice"" when Big Uncle doesn't recognize her at first
- She focuses on quietly observing details of the shop to tell GaoLing later, rather than actively engaging 
- She listens to her father speak to the customer without participating herself
- Her thoughts are mostly internal musings and memories rather than interactions
While she is attuned to her surroundings, this seems secondary to her overall reserved demeanor in the shop setting, especially with unfamiliar people like the customer and initially Big Uncle. The evidence points to her being shy and observant more so than outgoing.
Action: Answer(""A"")","Choice A is the best answer. Big Uncle and Little Uncle offer Old Widow Lau and the narrator a seat at a table reserved for customers upon their arrival at the narrator's family's ink shop. According to the tenth sentence of the first paragraph, ""Old Widow Lau refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors."" Old Widow Lau's rejection of the uncles' offer is characterized as insincere, as the next sentence of that paragraph shows that she doesn't actually want to leave the shop: ""She made weak efforts to leave."" Instead, her gestures are intended to inspire exaggerated insistence from the uncles, such that it isn't until the uncles' ""fourth insistence, [that Old Widow Lau and the narrator] finally sat."" Therefore, it can be most reasonably inferred from the passage that Old Widow Lau's reluctance to stay for tea is feigned because she isn't genuinely firm in her resolve.Choice B is incorrect because the passage doesn't imply that Old Widow Lau's reluctance is inconsiderate or that the family has been planning her visit. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the shop isn't unusually busy. Instead, only one customer is mentioned in the passage.

","Choices:
  A: describe a culture.
  B: criticize a tradition.
  C: question a suggestion.
  D: analyze a reaction.
","Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
The first paragraph presents a question about whether Chie would have reacted differently to Akira's marriage proposal if he had followed tradition instead of approaching her directly. 
Key points:
- It mentions Akira ""breaking all tradition"" by coming directly
- It asks if Chie would have been ""more receptive"" if Akira had followed the traditional process of using a go-between
- It sets up Chie's reaction to Akira's direct approach
The main focus is not on describing the culture or tradition itself, but rather analyzing how breaking that tradition affected Chie's reaction to the proposal. The paragraph doesn't really criticize the tradition or question Akira's suggestion.
Therefore, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to analyze Chie's reaction to Akira's untraditional direct approach, and consider if her reaction would have been different if he followed tradition.
Action: Answer(""D"")","Choice D is the best answer. The first paragraph (lines 1-4) reflects on how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter's hand in marriage. In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have been more likely to say yes to Akira's proposal if Akira had followed tradition: ""Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form - had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a go-between - would Chie have been more receptive?"" Thus, the main purpose of the first paragraph is to examine why Chie reacted a certain way to Akira's proposal.Choice $A$ is incorrect because the first paragraph describes only one aspect of Japanese culture (marriage proposals) but not the culture as a whole. Choice B is incorrect because the first paragraph implies a criticism of Akira's individual marriage proposal but not the entire tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice $C$ is incorrect because the narrator does not question a suggestion.",D,D,1,1648,219,1867,
