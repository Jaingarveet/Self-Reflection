Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.

  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.

  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
","Thought: The correct answer choice would weaken the connection between increased firm size and monopoly power by challenging the idea that larger firms with specialized workers have inherent advantages over smaller ones. 

Choice A discusses regional monopolies, which does not directly relate to firm size and does not undermine the connection. 

Choice B states that narrower tasks lead to lower salaries, but this does not impact the connection between firm size and market power. 

Choice C describes collusion among dominant firms, which strengthens the connection between size and monopoly power, rather than undermining it. 

Choice D notes variations in the scale of businesses across industries, but this does not refute the link between increased size and monopoly power within specific industries. 

Choice E indicates that further specializing workers does not always lead to increased productivity, and can be offset by higher costs. This directly challenges the notion that larger, more specialized firms inherently have a productivity advantage, thus undermining the connection to monopoly power. 

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

This means being energetic in their representation and acting as a diligent advocate for the client's position and rights within the legal system. While the scholars emphasize the lawyer's role as an advocate, this does not mean being a mere mouthpiece but rather providing energetic and diligent representation.

The reference to railroads serves to illustrate an industry that exemplifies the concept of the Pin Factory, characterized by increasing returns to scale and the potential for market dominance. This example highlights the challenges of applying the Invisible Hand concept in industries with such characteristics, and how it can lead to a concentration of power.
