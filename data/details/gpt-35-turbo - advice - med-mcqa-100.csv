","Thought:
Anaerobic glycolysis is the process of glucose breakdown in the absence of oxygen. It occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and produces energy in the form of ATP. The end product of anaerobic glycolysis is pyruvate, which is converted to lactate in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase. The net yield of ATP in anaerobic glycolysis is 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. However, 2 NADH molecules are also produced, which can be used in the electron transport chain to produce additional ATP.
Action: Answer(""C"")","Anaerobic Glycolysis ETC is not working hence NADH cannot enter ETC to form ATP. NADH is used to regenerate NAD by LDH Lactate is the end of anaerobic glycolysis.

The axillary artery is a continuation of the subclavian artery and is divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle. The second part of the axillary artery is located posterior to the pectoralis minor muscle. The branches of the second part of the axillary artery include the thoracoacromial artery, the lateral thoracic artery, and the subscapular artery. The subscapular artery gives rise to the circumflex scapular artery and the thoracodorsal artery. The circumflex scapular artery anastomoses with the dorsal scapular artery, which is a branch of the transverse cervical artery. The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries arise from the third part of the axillary artery and supply the shoulder joint and the muscles of the rotator cuff. The suprascapular artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk and supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles.

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65.4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10.4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities.2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services.3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population.2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development.3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP;2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders;3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State.2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma.3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided.4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care.

","Choices:
  A: Pka is equal to Ph
  B: High concentration
  C: Weak acid and weak base combination
  D: easy to measure
","Reflection:
Bicarbonate buffer is an important buffer system in the human body. It helps to maintain the pH of the blood within a narrow range. The pKa of bicarbonate buffer is 6.1, which is close to the pH of blood (7.4). This means that bicarbonate buffer is most effective at buffering blood pH. Additionally, bicarbonate buffer is a weak acid and weak base combination, which means that it can buffer both acidic and basic substances. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Weak acid and weak base combination.
Action: Answer(""C"")","(High concentration): (711-/2- Shinde 8th edition)Bicarbonate Buffer system* Consists of weak acid ""Carbonic acid"" (H2CO3) and strong base (HCO3), NaHCO3 (Sodium bicarbonate)* Normal ratio in blood =NaHCO3H2CO3=201* They are the chief buffers of blood and constitute the so called Alkali reserve* Neutralisation of strong and non volatile acids entering the ECF is achieved by the bicarbonate buffers* Bicarbonate buffer system is directly linked up with respiration* Bicarbonate buffers system serve as an index to understand the disturbance in the acid base balance of the body (476- U. Satyanarayan 4th)Advantages of bicarbonate buffer system* It is present in very high concentration than other buffer system (26 to 28 millimole per littre )* Produces H2CO3 which is weak acid and volatile and CO2 is exhaled out* Hence it is a very good physiological buffer and acts as a front line defense.Disadvantages - As a chemical buffer, it is rather weak, pKa is further away from the physiological pH",C,B,0,417,117,534,
