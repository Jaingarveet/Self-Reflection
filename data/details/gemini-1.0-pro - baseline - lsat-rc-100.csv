","Thought: 
The passage states that corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
The passage also states that corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments.
The passage also states that figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners.
The passage also states that the corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another.
The passage also states that the despedida is perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity.

The passage states that Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible and that the fantastic was not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns. He also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit"" and that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear.
The radical critics, on the other hand, believed that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and that it should be useful. They also believed that reality should be depicted ""as it is"" and that the fantastic was superfluous to a writer's concerns.
Thus, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

","Thought:
The passage describes Marshall's strategic and methodological legacy to the field of public interest law.
He and the NAACP developed innovations that forever changed the landscape of public interest law.
One aspect of this campaign, the test case strategy, involved sponsoring litigation of tactically chosen cases at the trial court level with careful evaluation of the precedential nuances and potential impact of each decision.
This allowed Marshall to try out different approaches and discover which was the best to be used.
An essential element in the success of this tactic was the explicit recognition that in a public interest legal campaign, choosing the right plaintiff can mean the difference between success and failure.
Marshall carefully selected cases with sympathetic litigants, whose public appeal, credibility, and commitment to the NAACP's goals were unsurpassed.
In addition, Marshall used sociological and psychological statistics—presented in expert testimony, for example, about the psychological impact of enforced segregation—as a means of transforming constitutional law by persuading the courts that certain discriminatory laws produced public harms in violation of constitutional principles.
This tactic, while often effective, has been criticized by some legal scholars as a pragmatic attempt to give judges nonlegal material with which to fill gaps in their justifications for decisions where the purely legal principles appear inconclusive.
The question asks which pair of tactics used by an environmental-advocacy public interest law firm is most closely analogous to the strategies that Marshall utilized during his work with the NAACP.
Choice A is the most closely analogous to the strategies that Marshall utilized during his work with the NAACP.
