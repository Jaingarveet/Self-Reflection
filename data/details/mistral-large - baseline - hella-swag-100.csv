","Thought:
The text describes a guy playing the drums and then stopping. The most likely completion would be something that follows logically from this action.

Action: Answer(""B"")

Explanation:
The guy stops drumming and shakes his head and smiles. This is a likely completion because it suggests that the guy has finished playing the drums and is reacting to his performance. The other options do not follow logically from the text. For example, placing the sticks on the drum would not necessarily follow from stopping, and writing on a napkin for two minutes is unrelated to playing the drums. Starting to play so hard that his fingers bleed is also unlikely because it suggests that the guy did not stop playing the drums, which contradicts the text.",,B,A,0,360,159,519,

[header] How to grow biennial vegetables [title] Wait to plant until after the final frost to prevent seeding in the first year.

  C: During the growing season, using a frost rake every six to seven weeks is ideal. [substeps] Rows should be spaced with patches of grass spaced about two or three feet apart, and that grass should fall between 12-12 inches (30-61 cm) in length.
  D: [substeps] If your plants are grown in the late spring or summer, wait for a temperature that's between 30 and 35 degrees fahrenheit (4 to 5 degrees celsius) for the ripen phase to improve growth. [title] Select a sunny area near the plant.
