","Thought: 
The paragraph is about the importance of excelling in at least one area to gain a competitive edge in the market. It does not guarantee success or huge profits, but it suggests that being the best in at least one thing can help a company compete. This is closest to the meaning of choice A and D. However, choice D implies a necessity for success, which is not stated in the paragraph. Therefore, choice A is the most accurate.

Given that J is the fourth speaker, this means J speaks after lunch. 
From the conditions, we know that G must speak before lunch, so G must be one of the first three speakers. 
Also, F must speak in the first or third place. 
Since J is the fourth speaker, the third speaker cannot be J, so the third speaker must be F.

Given the conditions:
1) The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
2) The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department.
3) The administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
4) The human resources department is not at the upper level of the administration department.
From these conditions, we can infer that the human resources department must be on one of the top two floors, as it is above the administrative department, which is above the planning department.

This choice does not meet condition 3, which states that if X is in the sales department, then W cannot be in the sales department.
Choice B: Public Relations Department: W; Production Department: G, I, X; Sales Department: F, H, Y
This choice does not meet condition 4, which states that F must be in the production department.
Choice C: Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, G, H; Sales Department: I, Y, W
This choice does not meet condition 2, which states that F and G cannot be in the same department.
Choice D: Public Relations Department: X; Production Department: F, I, W; Sales Department: G, H, Y
This choice meets all conditions. H and Y are in the same department, F and G are not in the same department, X is not in the sales department, and F is in the production department.

","Thought: 
Given that F and M are not in charge of the same department, and F and G are not in charge of the same department, F must be in charge of a department alone. Similarly, since H and I are not in charge of the same department, one of them must be in charge of a department alone. However, one assistant can manage all three departments. If F, H, and I each manage a department alone, the assistant managing all three departments must be either G, M, or P. This leaves two assistants to share the remaining department. Since F, G, H, and M each manage a department alone, the only possible pair left to share a department is I and P.

Option C provides this explanation: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services.
