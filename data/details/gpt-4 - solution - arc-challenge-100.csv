Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Choices:
  A: It has melted.
  B: It has sublimated.
  C: It has evaporated.
  D: It has condensed.
","Thought: 
When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, the water vapor in the air turns directly into a solid (ice), forming frost. This process is a form of sublimation, where a substance transitions from a gas to a solid without passing through the liquid phase.
