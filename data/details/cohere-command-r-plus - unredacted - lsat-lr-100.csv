","Thought: 
The correct answer is choice D.

The principle illustrated in the argument is that evidence obtained through illegal means is inadmissible and cannot form the basis for punitive action. In the given scenario, the company cannot take punitive measures against Ellison, despite his admission of wrongdoing, because the evidence against him was obtained illegally.

Choice D illustrates this principle. Kuttner's admission of setting illegal animal traps was obtained through the conservation officer's trespass, which is an illegal act. Therefore, any punitive action by the officer against Kuttner is not justifiable due to the inadmissibility of the evidence.

While the other choices present scenarios involving separate instances of wrongdoing or inconsistent punishment, they do not directly relate to the principle of illegally obtained evidence and its impact on the justifiability of punitive action.

By focusing on the precise legal principle and understanding the distinction between admissible and inadmissible evidence, we can correctly identify choice D as the best illustration of the argument's principle.

This indirectly contributes to more environmental damage, as the city's overall efforts to combat pollution are hindered.

","Thought: 
The argumentative technique used in the context is ""conditionally advocating a factic."" This technique involves presenting an accusation that is less offensive (""unyielding"") while still conveying the same meaning as stronger, more abusive terms. This accusation is conditional because it relies on the acceptance of the premise that group members are not yielding, and thus, it is difficult to deny the conclusion that they are unyielding.

Answer explanation: 
Choice C is the correct answer because it accurately describes the argumentative strategy of presenting an alternative accusation that is less offensive while still making the same point. This strategy is conditional because it relies on the acceptance of a certain premise (not yielding) to support the conclusion (unyielding behavior).

Incorrect choices:
- A and B are incorrect because they involve rejecting a factic, whereas the context involves presenting an alternative factic.
- D is incorrect because the argumentative technique does not directly aim to help the group reach a consensus; it is more focused on making an accusation stick.
- E is incorrect because the argument is not structured as a traditional premise-and-conclusion argument, where one could accept the premise but deny the conclusion. The technique is more about reframing the accusation in a less offensive way while maintaining its validity.

The original argument commits the fallacy of *false cause* by implying a causal relationship (infrequent grocery shopping leads to buying frozen dinners) without sufficient evidence. It generalizes that since most people in Hallstown shop infrequently, they must also buy frozen dinners regularly.

Choice D presents a similar flawed pattern of reasoning. It generalizes that since most commuters drive sedans, and most people in Highland County are commuters, then most people in the county must drive sedans. This argument also assumes a causal link without considering other factors that may influence car preferences or the availability of other car types.

  E: The university will not need to reduce spending next year if it markets its programs more aggressively.
","Thought: 
The argument's conclusion is that aggressive marketing is necessary to maintain the quality of education by increasing enrollment and avoiding spending cuts. 

Choice A is incorrect because it suggests that increasing enrollment will negatively impact educational quality, which is contrary to the argument's conclusion. 

Choice B is attractive because it links enrollment and spending, but it doesn't address the conclusion's focus on maintaining educational quality. 

Choice C is partially correct as it establishes a link between marketing and enrollment, but it doesn't address the broader conclusion about educational quality and spending. 

Choice D is the correct answer as it assumes that reducing spending will compromise educational quality, which is the key relationship the argument relies on to conclude that aggressive marketing is necessary to maintain quality. 

Choice E is tempting as it links marketing and spending, but it doesn't address the conclusion's focus on educational quality. 

By reflecting on the broader context of the argument and the relationships between its components, we can identify the correct assumption that supports the conclusion.

Smokers of low-nicotine cigarettes, who generally smoke more cigarettes per day, can still end up with similar nicotine blood levels as those who smoke high-nicotine cigarettes. This explains why blood nicotine levels are similar across smokers of different cigarette types. 

While choice A is true, it doesn't explain the phenomenon in the study, as it focuses on a maximum absorption limit rather than absorption rates across different cigarette types. 

Choice C is irrelevant as it doesn't address the relationship between smoking behavior and blood nicotine levels. Choice D introduces tar levels, which are unrelated to the study's focus on nicotine absorption. Choice E describes nicotine clearance from the body, which is not relevant to the study's findings on nicotine absorption across different cigarette types.

The text states that while all cats produce the proteins that cause allergies in some people, the specific proteins vary from cat to cat. This directly supports statement C, which highlights that not all cats are identical in the proteins they secrete. While statements A, B, D, and E may be true to some extent, they are not as strongly supported by the provided information.

  E: Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks.
","Thought: 
The question asks for an explanation for the phenomenon that heavily congested highways have a lower rate of fatal accidents. Thus, we must consider factors that reduce the severity of accidents, despite heavy traffic. 

Choice D states that most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed. Speed is a critical factor in the severity of accidents, and directly relates to the rate of fatalities. Therefore, this choice provides the best explanation for the phenomenon described.

  E: It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument.
","Thought: 
The statement in question supports the main conclusion of the argument, which is that proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised. It does so by providing a reason: that cell phone use is far more upsetting on airplanes than on other forms of transportation due to the close quarters and inability to move seats. This statement is a secondary conclusion that directly supports the main conclusion, making it a crucial step in the argument's reasoning.

Argument structure:
- Main conclusion: Proposals to allow cell phone use on airplanes are ill-advised.
- Secondary conclusion: Cell phone use is far more upsetting on airplanes than on buses and trains.
- Premise: Cell phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to passengers.
- Premise: Airline passengers are packed tightly and cannot easily move seats.

The statement in question is a conclusion that supports the main conclusion, so the correct answer is ""D"".

  E: draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do
","Thought: 
The argument assumes a direct link between motivation and outcome, suggesting that personal gain motives inherently preclude societal benefit. This assumption is the argument's main vulnerability as it fails to acknowledge that actions driven by personal gain can still result in societal benefits, especially if those benefits are intentionally sought or recognized as a consequence of the action. 

Answer choice D accurately identifies this vulnerability by highlighting the argument's assumption that an action is unlikely to produce a societal benefit outcome if motivated by personal gain.
